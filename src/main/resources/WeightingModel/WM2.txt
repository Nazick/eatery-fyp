Since I haven't tried all the sandwiches here, this review is just for their hawaiian chicken sandwich. The sauce was way too sweet when combined with the pineapple. The sandwich felt one note. But for $6, its not too shabby.

Damn, I was so not ready for this.My taste buds we're definitely fried, the last thing that I wanted was a sandwich.  I didn't want to chew anything, I'd much rather prefer soup if I was to eat anything at all.  My friend insisted on walking (another activity I was dreading) to PH to get Earl of Sandwich though.  FML.I'd passed this place many times before, not really caring for a sandwich in Vegas.  I can always remember it being busy though.  Now I know why.  Even with my busted taste buds, I could still taste that this sandwich was definite hangover goodness.  The tortilla soup, while a little too thick for me, still had flavor and went down easy on the throat.All of this for only about $13 bucks with a drink.  I'm going to have to come back at the beginning of a Vegas trip next time.

I loved it the first time and intended to give this place 5 stars since it was good and I ate it two days in a row. This time I feel like there was a lack in quality for the sandwich. I ordered 4 Earl's club sandwiches, and none of them had lettuce -NADA! It also had too much bacon, so the sandwich was wayyy too salty. Eh I am officially sick of this place. I will not crave for it next time.

I think I eat here at least 3 times during every Vegas trip. It's especially helpful that they are open 24 hours which is perfect for drunk munchies at 3..4...5 AM. Love the toasted soft bread and how the sandwiches are consistent. I personally like the classic Earl's Club but I haven't tried a bite of one yet that wasn't good.Beware that some pools don't let you bring your leftover food inside! So instead of sacrificing half of your sandwich to the trash you better eat the whole thing asap.

Casino food locations can be hit and miss and this Earl of Sandwich location is always a hit with me.Located in Planet Hollywood, this was a convenient dinner choice after a long day working (Yes, you read that right) and not wanting to venture far for food.  I had just checked into the hotel and taken my bags upstairs and wanted to go somewhere easy and super casual.  This is a walk up and order kind of deal and it's sandwiches, easy 'nuf.They say, "You are what you eat" and I have been told I'm All American on more than one occasion.  This sandwich is served hot with turkey, buttermilk dressing, cranberries, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato.  I'm not a huge fan of hot sandwiches (read: Quizno's) but everything coming off the conveyor belt smelled really good, so I took a chance.I'm glad I did.  This has become one of my favorite sandwiches and I ate here the following night as well.  The service was quick and the location was clean and seated many people.  This will be a dedicated dining spot anytime I stay at Planet Hollywood or happen to be close by and hungry.

My friends and I just finished shopping at the Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood. After a few hours of shopping, we were all starving, and needed to find a restaurant that was quick and easy. Because it was New Year's Eve, we knew that every restaurant and buffet would be packed.  So we decided to give Earl of Sandwich a chance.Gotta tell you...ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS I'VE MADE IN MY LIFE. I ordered the Hawaiian Sandwich, which consisted of ham, chicken, pineapple, and barbecue sauce. It was satisfying!! Even though Earl of Sandwich falls into the category of a quick place to eat, it did not have the fast-food quality food. I was so happy with my dinner that I convinced my friends to come back a few hours later (around 2AM). The sandwiches at Earl of Sandwich are great for after drinking....believe me.I LOVE EARL!!Personal favorite:Hawaiian Sandwich

Great value for a hot toasted sandwich!  Great for lunch, even better after a night of partying - it's open 24 hours!Really enjoyed the original - tender, pink roast beef with cheddar and creamy mild horseradish.  Walk-up and order - for $5.99 you won't be disappointed.  I love how all the sandwiches are priced the same.

You definitely have to bookmark this place if you plan on coming to Vegas.  Everything is way further away than it seems when walking, which makes you tired, cranky, and hungry.  The last thing you want to be doing in that state is figure out where to eat; because inevitably, you'll end up paying $20 bucks for a crappy sandwich.  So save yourself the disappointment of overspending on awful food; keep this place in the back of your mind.  At ~$6 for delicious sandwich, you won't be let down.The Italian has all the deliciousness you would expect with salami, capicola, cooked ham, Italian dressing, and cheese.  The big surprise for me was the All American: Roasted turkey, buttermilk ranch, cranberries,cheddar, lettuce, and tomatoes.  I thought to myself, "Cranberries?  Really?"  Oh yes, really. They push the sandwich over the edge of mediocrity and into the realm of hunger satisfying deliciousness.  Open 24/7, you'll never have an excuse again to pay for crappy food in Vegas.

I stayed at Planet Hollywood two weeks ago and discovered this beautiful 24 hour "Bodega" (24 hour deli shop in NYC).  I had about a couple sandwiches, just as my friend Melissa previously commented did as well.  I came here after partying and it definitely hit the "spot.!"

I don't know what happened. Maybe I caught them on a bad day. Maybe I just have higher standards.As soon as I got there, I felt that I was rushed to order. This was my first time there and didn't get much chance to look at the menu before my order was taken so fast that I didn't have a chance to add anything else on. When I got to the cashier I was able to add on the other items I wanted but with a lot of attitude from the girl at the register.The food came pretty quickly, which was nice, and the sandwich was really good. The tomato soup, however, was really the worst I've had anywhere with very stale tasting croutons.Not too bad of a place to eat, but the staff definitely need to work on their attitude and customer service. (That being said, I seem to run into a lot of this in Vegas. Maybe it's just the customary atmosphere...)If you get a chance, I would highly recommend Panera Bread instead.

I love this place so much, I came here twice in 2 days. And brought 8 sandwiches home with me for friends.BLT - So good! So much bacon. :)Ham & Swiss - Yummy, too. But I didn't like the mustard with it.Original - BOMB.orgHam, Egg & Cheese Breakfast sandwich - I wish I had one for breakfast again this morning. :(Tomato soup - It was good, but I've had better.For $6 a sandwich, you can't go wrong.

Delicious!! Its awesome that you can order food from a deli in a Vegas hotel and the sandwiches start from $5.99... Their sandwiches are yummmy too!! If you're staying at the hotel, you don't need to go anywhere else, pick up a sandwich and bring it up to your room to enjoy...This place is open 24 hours and will not disappoint you.. Other delis or restaurants around here will charge you over $10, where this place you'll pay under $8 for a good sandwich... My group ordered the club, Hawaiian, roast beef, and the mozzarella sandwiches and we were VERY pleased with all our options.. They did not disappoint us at all.. This is definitely a great place to grab a quick bite so all those carbs will absorb the alcohol you're going to be drinking for the night...

Great sandwich, excellent value. $5.99 for a really good sandwich on the strip? Yes, it's true! The sandwiches were smaller than I expected them to be, but were also much more flavorful than expected. We just had sandwiches. No sides, no chips, nothing else, and we were perfectly satisfied, but certainly not stuffed. Perfect!I had "The Italian" and my wife had the "Caprese" and both were very tasty. I would certainly eat here again.

Was STARVING after a night of partying in the highest heels I owned, and we all wanted some immediate, rumbly-in-my-tumbly gratification. I've never been to Earl of Sandwhich but B and his friends always make a point to stop by on a Vegas trip, so it must be pretty good. +1 already when i saw their list of hot sandwiches - i love hot sammiches. Earl of Sandwhich is just a short hop and a skip away from the casino, and the line was pretttty long. But the sandwiches were good enough and/or we were lazy enough that we ended up getting in line anyway. Ravenous B (as usual) ordered the Cannonball! and the Earl's Club. Cannonball! was only okay, nothing notable, but The Earl's Club was a very classic sandwich - can't go wrong there. I got the Italian, which was BOMB. Even though the sandwiches are on the small side, I didn't end up eating all of it since we also got the Chicken Tortilla Soup, which was delicious and scaldingly hot ("And Andrea, I mean SCALDING hot.") Another +1 since we both hate lukewarm soup. Saved the last half of my sandwich to eat later that night, and it was STILL delicious.at ~$6 per sandwich, it's a little expensive for the size. But considering I paid that much for a glass of grapefruit juice later that day, this is probably the best deal you're going to get. Aside from Steak-and-Eggs.

During my 5 night stay in Vegas (WAY TOO DAMN LONG!), I ate here pretty much every single day (sometimes late night too). If it wasn't good, then that would not have been the case! Although the line may seem really long at times, it moves relatively fast. You order first and then you continue waiting in line to pay. One time, my food was ready (beeper was buzzing) AS I was paying. NOICE! I'm not a big sandwich person usually, but Earl's is SO GOOD. I felt like I almost tried their whole menu. Pretty much nothing can go wrong with whatever you order, but my favorites (as well as my friends) were the Tuna Melt and the Hawaiian one. May I re-emphasize: SO GOOODDDDD! But by the last day, I got really sick of eating sandwiches, so I ordered their vegetable soup too. That was okay.

I think the past reviews say it all - this place is delicious! No one should leave Vegas without eating a tasty sandwich from this gem in the city of lights. I've been here twice now - the first time I came around 12:30pm and the line was eternally lengthy. The second time I came here was last week, around 10:45am - very short line and the food still tasted great.I highly recommend ordering the Full Montagu hot sandwich. The roast beef is so tender and the mustardy sauce they lace their sandwich with adds a delicious kick. I also highly recommend buying a bag of their BBQ chips, which was satisfyingly crunchy and savory.Love, love, love Earl of Sandwich.

This is really a 4.5 star rating.Where to begin... These sandwiches are crazy good.  I tried three different sandwiches that I shared between my wife and another friend.  They were all awesome.  My wife (who isn't even a big fan of sandwiches) took one bite that quickly followed with her eyes opening up wide and just saying "wow."  She then followed by asking "how the hell did they do that?"  There's a reason why there's always a line and bit of a wait, but for the shear volume of customers they have they do a good job of not making you wait too long to enjoy one of their great creations.

My favorite place to grab a sandwich in Las Vegas.  After a night of partying, if a mighty good sammy is what you're looking for, then I suggest you stop by PH.

This being the 720th review for Earl of Sandwich, Im wondering if there's really any need to go into any kind of detail. Yelpers, for the most part, are an astute bunch and should be able to figure out that this is probably the safest bet on the Strip. Trix had The Original and it was awesome. I had a Cannonballs!, also awesome. Reasonably priced and very fast. Fucking A, man.

We needed something quick before a big dinner later on, so we stopped here. I had the hot caprese sandwich, and it was delicious. They put the dressing on the bread, so you get that great vinegar taste to couple up with the big chunks of mozz and tomatoes. I also had the earl grey lemonade, which I recommend trying. Wasn't overly sweet like most tea.

This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas, and since it's open 24 hours I can go any time I want! Their sandwiches  are delicious, the service is quick, and the food is very reasonably priced, too (only $5.99 for a sandwich). It's also conveniently located inside Planet Hollywood hotel just a minute's walk from Fat Tuesday, so you can kill two birds with one stone while you're here. My personal favorites are the Full Montagu and the Earl's Club. We ended up ordering extra sandwiches for our way back home on our trip there this past weekend, so lucky for me I have an Earl's Club waiting for me at home for lunch!

The hot sandwiches here never lets me down (anything wrapped in gold better be good).  We walked half of the Vegas strip to get to this infamous sandwich spot... of course took a few detours on the way but we did take this journey on foot from Venetian.  I stop here almost every visit to Vegas because for $5.99 a sandwich, it's the biggest bang for your buck.  I would recommend splitting sandwiches with a friend so you can get to try different flavors... but also some of the sandwiches just gets a little repetitive after about half.  The line here is fairly long but consistently moves so it doesn't feel too bad.  It's totally worth the wait if you're thinking about leaving and going somewhere else.  I need to franchise one in Orange County so i can serve my own little sandwich wrapped in gold!

Wow. Heavenly. We ate here 4 times over the course of our 3-day stay, and it was great. The best sandwiches were the Full Montagu (better than the Original) and All-American, and the Cobb Salad never disappointed. The bacon-based breakfast sandwiches were kinda salty, so avoid those, but pretty much anything is great because it comes with their delicious baked-in-the-grill bread and has a great balance of flavors. I highly recommend that you go out of your way if you're in Vegas just to try this place at least once (by the way, it's located on the south end at the junction of the casino area and the mall area).

You know why you're here. Yes you, at 4:00 am lining up and squinting at the menu to satisfy your drunken palate. Well if my experience of the same caliber has taught me anything, it's that ANY sandwich you order here is going to be delicious. Anytime of day/night and even the next day/night as leftovers. I highly recommend the tuna melt which is absolutely yummy. The prices are reasonable too for a pretty big sandwich and what's more is that these are made fresh and so you'll always get a warm sandwich.You might have to wait a bit depending on when you come and how many other people are also hungrily stumbling out of the clubs or casinos but it's such a much better option than trying to go to an expensive (and usually crappy) 24 hour restaurant on the strip.

Read the reviews and decided to give it a go.  Definitely was not disappointed.  It was lunchtime on a Saturday and the place had a decent line going.  The menu is fairly extensive so you'll likely find something you'll like.  I had the original roast beef which was freakin' awesome.  It was warm, gooey from the melted cheese and just really flavorful.  Put a little dijon mustard on there and you have a piece of sandwich heaven in your hands.My fiancee had the tuna melt and from the bite that I had... or rather, the only bite she allowed me... it was very good as well.  Prices aren't all that bad for a damn good sandwich.  Will I return?  Probably.  It's a nice alternative to countless buffets and foo-fooey restaurants in Sin City.

Overpriced, small portions.  The sandwich (a club) tasted fine, but it's about 6 inches long and was like 7 bucks.  Believe it or not, Subway is a better deal for both quantity and the fact that you can customize your sub, unlike at Earl.This place is for casino drunks that want to eat late night and don't care about wasting money, but simply want something to eat.  My wife and I tried it out in the late afternoon and regretted it.  We actually like Quizno's better too!

On my last trip to Vegas, one afternoon I woke up to discover that three different groups of people I went there to meet had independently decided to go to Earl of Sandwich.  Although I had never heard of this place before, it was clear that I had to try it, and I am definitely glad that I did.The first thing that stands out about Earl of Sandwich is the price.  When you are used to paying $8-10 for a sandwich in DC, $6 for a sandwich is fantastic.  And when that $6 sandwich tastes better than any that you're used to, it's mind-blowing to say the least.I tried The Original 1762, a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  I also had a taste of The Full Montagu, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard.  First off, the bread is outstanding.  It's toasted and has a great crunch to it, without being overly thick.  The meats are also great and the sandwiches have a good amount on them.  Although the sandwiches are a bit on the small side, they are ok for a smaller meal, especially when paired with chips or soup (which I did not personally try, but have heard good things about).Overall it's a great place to go and I highly recommend it.  That sandwich was one of the best I've ever had and I wish I had had time to try more of their menu.  Whether it's a late night snack or lunch, Earl of Sandwich is definitely worth checking out.

hella delicious sandwiches. I went for the original 1762 and it was like bliss touching the lips. Roast beef, cheddar chese, horseradish sauce. Super reasonable prices for anywhere and even better pricing since it is in Vegas. A sandwich is around 7 dollars. I don't know what it is with the bread, but it isn't a standard roll. It's sorta ciabatta-ish but not as tough. It held up to the sauces and meats inside nicely. Great bread.They have grey poupon and yellow mustard at the tables. I found myself using the grey poupon as sort of taqueria hot sauce and adding it on top as I bite into the succulent sandwich.It was so tasty, that we had it for lunch, partied, left at like 3-4am and went back for another one. I had the club this time and it was equally as good. Open 24 hours!

Apparently, Earl of Sandwich is a franchise.  But why isn't there one in California?  Can someone please open one up in LA??  PLEASE?!?  *sigh*  :(Yeah, there's not much more one can say about Earls that hasn't already been said.  It's become a Vegas staple for me and my friends.  Their sandwiches blow every other sandwich chain out of the water.  Yes, I'm talking to you Subway and Quiznos.  They use high quality, fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.  And at $5.99 a sandwich, it's a steal!I used to think the Full Monagu was the best, but I've come to realize that THE ORIGINAL is the way to go.  Freshly roasted beef, cheddar and creamy horseradish sauce on their signature hot, toasty artisan bread.  *drool*  Don't worry, the horse radish isn't overpowering at all.  I also like the tuna melt, but wasn't really a fan of the Caribbean jerk chicken.  I'm going to try Cannonballs! next time.Wait can be as long as 20-30 minutes during lunch time, but it's totally worth it once you find a sandwich you love.  Now open 24 hours.

Full Montagu - tastes like Potbelly's. Except the bread is thinner and softer and doesn't get as soggy.And sure subway is offered at a comparable price, but not on the strip. Last time I had subway, they charged me like $10-12 for a footlong. This place is a steal for the quality!

Oh Mr. Earl of Sandwiches! I heart your gold bars of delicious-ness. (Yes the sandwiches are wrapped in gold foil, and they're so rectangular!)My bf and I shared the Hawaii BBQ and the popular Full Montagu. Plus the Tomato soup. (Unfortunately the soup was lukewarm but the sandwiches made up for it)We liked the Hawaii BBQ better as it was more flavorful. We had to add Grey Poupon to the Full Montagu, and that made it 10x better.The bread is toasted with magic. Omgoodness.I want to stay in Planet  Hollywood next time just so I can have easy access to Mr. Earl *grabby hands*

So delicious. I only got the Original, but it was pretty near perfect. The blend of roast beef, crispy bread, and creamy horseradish sauce is sublime. Every bite melts in your mouth.The ice cream sandwich - what a perfect way to end your meal. Kind of like a brownie a la mode in sandwich form.The portions here don't look like much, but seriously, we all were huffin' and puffin' as we walked away. Deceptively filling for a good price.4.5 stars only because I wanted more horseradish sauce, but that's only a little gripe. Open 24 hours and you're by Planet Hollywood? Come here for a bite, you won't regret it.

I was hesitant at first to eat here thinking it was a run in the mill sandwich joint. It IS a sandwich joint and a GOOD one at that! The Hawaiian BBQ is delicious.. large variety to choose from & plenty of side choices from macaroni to chips. Nice selection at the soda fountain.. do the Dew'

***** Believe the Hype - Legit *****I was standing in a long line when my friend placed her order and asked for guac and special cheese's on her sandwich.  The cashier replied no to both items which shocked me.  How can you not serve guac?After plowing through the sandwiches I learned why.  An "Earl of Sandwich" is a science.  It has the perfect meat to bread ratio and everything just fits together.  It's best to just eat the sandwich as Master Ear intended it to be.  The bread is to die for.   It was so good we went 2 nights in a row and best of all it's late night.  I love how the sandwhich is packaged with the seal of approval sticker.  I thought the Hawaiian BBQ was  a little on the sweet side.  Enjoyed the Caribbean Jerk, Best BLT, Cannonballs, and All American.  Will try the Tuna Melt next time.Yes I ate 5 sandwiches in 2 sittings - Don't hate.

The wait may be a little long at times, but it's expected and worth it to have a deliciously toasted little sandwich.  It's probably my second very sandwich shop around.I like to get the light stuff, like the caprese sandwich, which I absolutely love! Filling yet refreshing.  Can't forget to pair it with the tomato soup!  It's creamy, and tomatoey, but not too overwhelming.  Some may say there is too much bread when they first look at it, but once you sink your first bite into it, there is a perfect ratio of meat to bread, and the bread is perfectly toasted, not too hard, not too soft.Pricing is reasonable.Advice, eat it the way it was meant to be eaten.. unless of course you're allergic or will die at the taste of mustard.

There used to be an Earl close to where I lived in Michigan.. but one day when I went for my favorite tuna melt in the world, it was gone, just like that.And since that day some 2 years ago, I have been pretty down. But then, while tipsily walking through Planet Hollywood, I saw it. I saw the shrine of all things holy.... EARL OF SANDWICH!The friends I was with walked in unassumingly, not that interested, and refusing to believe my ranting. But then again, my mouth may have been watering so much that I may not have been speaking properly.Once we all go out sandwiches though-- they became believers. The Earl makes a damn good sandwich. This place goes way beyond all other chain sandwich shops in the country, I can't wait for the day that The Earl conquers all. It is rightfully deserved.Trust me, if you want a sandwich. Go here. Hands down, no questions about it.

Earl of Sandwich is receiving four stars not because it is the best sandwich, but because it is the best DRUNK sandwich. The hot, toasty delicious creation presented to you is not drunk itself, but the mouth that it is being shoved in sure as all hell has probably had lots of alcohol enter it.So far I have tried the Original, Full Montagu and the Caribbean Chicken sandwiches. Don't remember much about them technically except that they sure were yummy for my ever so alcohol soaked tummy. Eat here and then put it all on black.

I'm pretty sure this place is open 24 hours? We came at 2am and the place was about half full. Honestly, take all the reviews with a grain of salt... When I wanted to go to Ike's in SF, my friend told me not to because "how can a sandwich be THAT good?!" "Maybe because I LOVE sandwiches???" I thought, but in hindsight, really... how CAN a sandwich be that good??? Didn't like how there was no choice for bread, and you have to get white, but it was still nice and toasted =) The Hawaiian BBQ chicken would be my recommendation but from what I've heard, you can't go wrong ;)

I always have to eat here when I am in Vegas. It's a must! The sandwiches are warm and the bread is toasted to perfection. I really wish they would open a location here. I normally get the Full Montague. Yumm, my mouth is watering thinking of this sandwich. I have tried other ones as well, the bread is all the same, but the Full Montague, which is filled with roast beef, turkey, and vegetables is the way to go! Another mentionable product is their tomato soup. I have no idea why, but I really like it from here. It's thick and puree-ish but not? I don't know but if you're up to it, definitely order the sandwich plus this soup.The line is always long, but the wait for the food to be prepared is pretty short. I kinda wish it wasn't located at Planet Hollywood, since their shops are not appeasing and their casino is ugly. I just hate that hotel in general. But if you walk further down you can get Fat Tuesdays with your sandwich!

Earl of Sandwich was my first spot when we arrived at Vegas.I was totally looking forward to checking this place out. I got the Caribbean jerk chicken as recommended on yelp and my friend got the tuna melt. She was disappointed it that they don't make fries since she was craving it. But that was another story.Anyway... she was so hungry that she finish her tuna melt in a heart beat and love it.I, on the other hand thought the Caribbean Jerk Chicken was just A-OK. In my opinion, the sandwich was bit greasy and it lack flavor. What I do like is their bread. It has a very crispy texture yet not crumbly.I would have gave it a 3 stars, but the service was fast and they are open 24 hours, thus the 4 stars. Still worth to check it out!

This place is soooo close to trumping Ike's Sandwiches in SF. Soooo good. I was sitting in class today back home daydreaming about how amazing my sandwich was. It is a MUST to go here.I got the Italian with --- Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomato. My first thought was that it was kind of a small and flat portion. I was WRONG. I think I went through half of my sandwich and was stuffed! My brain was satiated by it's wonderfulness too quick that it tricked my stomach into being full. (No joke. That physically happens with a satisfying meal!): My boyfriend got the Full Montegue that was amazing too. It had Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce. The bread is toasted to perfection. Everything about this place is mouth-watering. Why pay to eat buffets and overpriced mediocre restaurants? For $6.99 a pop, this place is soooooooo worth it.

Earl! Your golden wrapper makes me feel like I've won the golden ticket to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!No but seriously, I think of Earl's all day err day in Sin City. I eat Earls so I can have something to soak up my booze before going outI eat Earls after I go dancing so the calories burned can accommodate for the excess calorie consumption at 4AM in the morningI eat Earls even if the lines are ridiculously long  I eat Earls to stare at the bunch of starved zombies that populate here at the crack of dawnBut I really just eat Earls cause it's so damn delicious. I've tried the-The Earl's Club: you were just "okay" in my book.-Caribbean Jerk Chicken: too jerky.-Hawaiian BBQ: mmmhh! Tastes like Hawaiian pizza with a BBQ kick!-Italian: mama mia! Delizioso! The perfect combo and the italian sauce gave it a little extra somthing. Just a note: if you know you have an addiction to Earl, I would highly advise staying at a hotel FAR away from Planet Hollywood or else you'll soon find yourself blowing money not at the casinos...but at Earls. Yep.

I've been eating subway meatball subs for as long as I can remember. I thought it was good, until I had the Earl of Sandwich Cannonball. Now my dream of owning a Subway toaster oven with sides of meatballs, roasted garlic bread and provolone has been completely shattered. Heck, all my dreams are now secondary to one:I just want to live nearer to the Earl and his meaty balls of goodness.

great sandwich, but not the absolute best i've had. plus they're skimpy on the amount of meat they give you in the italian one. living in SF, it's easy to find a better sandwich. even Safeway makes up a mean Primo Italiano sandwich. if i went back to Vegas, i wouldn't think to come back unless i had a craving for sandwiches for some strange reason.

FINALLY got to try it for my first time yesterday since I had a staycation at the Planet Hollywood.  Results: IN LOVE!I sat down, opened my hot sandwich, and as soon as I took a bite out of my Earl Club sandwich, I was in love.  The bread was freshly baked to order and it was so good.  The sandwich sauce they use; delish!  My boyfriend had the meatball sub and he was just as in love as I was with this place.  We are going to eat here again today before we leave the PH.  This shop will definitely make us keep coming back for more.  It's the perfect size too!  I think that the freshly baked bread they use is what definitely makes this sandwich stick out.  I love bread though, so I might be a little bias.  I can't wait to try more of their sandwiches!  I also had the macaroni salad, pasta salad, and their chocolate chip cookies.  They taste like they should; nothing to rave about.   But the sandwiches...YUM!  I think I can eat one everyday!  I'm very glad I got to finally try Earl of Sandwich.Go now!  You will NOT be disappointed!  Not even by the price!

Nothing better than a great sandwich to help nurse a hangover! Much higher quality than the normal Subway or Quiznos at a great price for the strip. The bread and mustard totally make the sandwiches and the salads are appropriately dressed (unlike many of the patrons). This is a great stop either for lunch or late night snack.

Finally after my girlfriend talking this place up for the last several months I had the privilege of trying the legend that is Earl of Sandwich or more commonly known as "Earl's." I honestly did not want to get my hopes up about this place because like I've mentioned before when it comes to food I'm too pretentious and stubborn to believe an opinion about food other than my own :pI was so impressed by this place not just by the taste but the price, quantity, quality of food and the BREAD...yes the BREAD. They make their own artisan bread and it's one of the best sandwich breads I've ever tasted. Crispy outside, soft on the inside however biting through it, the textures come together and it's yeast n flour filled divinity.I bought the BEST BLT for myself but my friends and I shared with each other so I sampled 4 different sandwiches including mine: Hawaiian BBQ, Cannonballs!, The Full Montagu and mine the BEST BLT.Hawaiian BBQ: sweet and savory just like anything "Hawaiian" but with BBQ sauce and pineapple and a generous serving of ham.Cannonballs!: a meatball sandwich that won't fall apart on you. Solidly constructed with Parmesan and chewy melted Mozzarella makes an excellent sandwichThe Full Montagu: the reason this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star review, wasn't that impressed just tasted like a regular roast beef sandwich but still goodBEST BLT: Lives up to its name! Most BLT's is a couple of strips of bacon that you pull out with one bite and all your bacon is gone. This BLT sandwich is filled with bacon bits throughout and is a must for anyone who enjoys this classic sandwich.Earl's definitely lived up to the hype and is a must-go on my Vegas trips from now until eternity and maybe a little bit after that too :p.

Maybe I hyped myself about this place too much? Maybe I was feeling too crappy to enjoy my sandwich? Maybe it was the rude ladies working behind the counter that gave me dirty looks? Whatever the reason, I didn't think my full montagu sandwich was as delicious as everyone hyped it about. I'm a tad bit disappointed, but fully ready to go again and give this place another try. Will updated this review again once it happens.

This place is so good I ate here twice in a row for lunch out of the 4 days I was in Vegas. They offer a large variety of hot sandwiches, salads, some wraps, and baked goods. The price is very reasonable which is great if you're on a budget. For about $8 I could get a nice sandwich and a drink with free refills! The bread is what really makes it for me, nice and warm and a little bit crispy. My bf got the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich both times because he said it was so good. I got the meatball sandwich one time and a turkey sandwich with cranberries, lettuce, tomatoes, and some other things (I can't remember what it's called) which I would highly recommend. Just a side note, their Earl's Grey Lemonade is an Arnold Palmer. I didn't know that the first time, but it was fine with me since I like them anyway!

OMG YES. I got the original and it was cheap and melt-in-your-mouth lusciously delicious. Their system is smooth and the place is nice, and the hours are sooooo convenient. 24/7! Even though it's Vegas, finding good food at certain hours, especially for a reasonable price, is harder than I thought, so this was fantastic. I wish we had one here...noticed they were advertising their franchise. Lol. Please someone...open one in SoCal?
