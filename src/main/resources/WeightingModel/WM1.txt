All the sandwiches are so good! My favorite is the caprese, but I also tried the caribbean jerk one, the roast beef one, the hawaiian one, the club one, the american one, some chicken caesar wrap one and others I can't remember! But seriously, for $6... so worth it!

Holy mother of sandwich heaven! I can't believe I've lived 27 years and never had the opportunity to enjoy a sandwich such as the Hawaiian BBQ. The bread is not fully cooked as it is prepared to order and sent through the oven baked to ultimate perfection. Earl, we will meet again one day. Until then I will only dream of our lunch time we shared one sunny day in Las Vegas.

HEAVENLY.I can't even describe how much I love this place.  I stop by every single time I go to vegas (which is about two/three times a year).  Although I wouldn't call this place a normal "restaurant" because of the cafeteria like line and open venue~ It is a MUST try for any visitor.  The Sandwiches, Salads and Soups are to die for!!The bread is toasted to crisp perfection and the ingredients inside compliment each other perfectly.My fave:The All-American SandwichTuna Melt SandwichThe Earl's Cobb SaladTomato SoupNot sure I'm a HUUUGE fan of the desserts, but I'm most definitely a fan of the sandwiches, salads and soups!!

I have heard so many friends rave about Earls that I feel like I've been here a thousand times.  Finally I can put an end to all the "you've got to try Earl's" and "you've never been to Earl's?" and "dude, Earl's is amazing" because I ate at Earl's!!!  Is everyone quite satisfied now?This Earl's is in the Planet Hollywood Casino which attributes to its popularity and long lines.  I don't think there is anywhere on the strip you could find a more affordable meal unless you are completely desperate and stumble towards a fast food chain like McDonald's or Subway.  Speaking of Subway, Earl's is nothing like Subway or Quiznos for that matter.  I was somewhat expecting Earl's to be like these two popular chains but fortunately, Earl's was a few hundred notches up on the sandwich ladder.  Earl has a extremely efficient ordering and sandwich production line.  I promplty received my order within a couple minutes of payment, mind you, there was quite the crowd so the speed of execution was quite impressive and would make any VP of Operations proud.When a place is so hyped up I'm usually faced with bitter disappointment but I'm happy to say that this time, with Earl's, I wasn't disappointed.  Mind you, it wasn't a life altering experience and harps and giggling angels didn't fill my head after the first bite but overall, it was one of my best sandwich experiences.Because of all the hype, I took it upon myself to try as many sandwiches during my visit as possible so I promptly ordered the Original roast beef, the Earl's Club, the Italian and the Jerk Chicken along with a brownie, a Blue Moon Beer and a Coke.  Before you start pondering what a complete pig I am, I shared these with my group of 4 so everyone got a 1/4 sandwich each.  This was a great way to try a wide selection of their sandwiches, a prix fix Earl's sampling if you would.On to the actual sandwiches. The Original was superb.  The roast beef was juicy and flavorful, the horshradish was spicy and blended perfectly with the beef and sharp cheddar cheese.  It was light years ahead of the roast beef sandwich I had at Quiznos just a few weeks before. The Club was also very delightful with turkey and ham with fresh lettece and tomatoes.  The Italian wasn't my favorite with its Pastrami and ham combination but everyone else in my group thought it was terrific, I guess I'm not a big fan of Pastrami.  For me, the star of the show was the Jerk Chicken.  The chicken was moist and the Jerk sauce added a spicy kick to this exceptional sandwich.  The thing that made all these sandwiches special was the bread.  Only one kind of bread is served at Earl's and its their artisan white perfectly toasted.  If you believe that bread is what makes a great sandwich then Earl's should be your sandwich Mecca because you would be extremely hard pressed to find another worthy opponent.Hmmmm, I seem to have written too much....I doubt any of you will actually read to this point but for those that make it this far, thanks, I'm relieved my rambling was entertaining enough to retain your attention for this long.  I guess I'll just summerize Earl's in one last line.  If you haven't tried Earl Of Sandwich, you should listen to all these 5 star Yelp reviews and take the plunge, you'll most likely become another raver like myself.

Their sandwiches are very delicious for $5.99. I got the Italian (we also got a 10% employee discount). It measure about 8" long - it is more filling than it looks. It doesn't quite fill you up like a Subways Sandwich, but for $5.99, it's an amazing deal.The Italian is absolutely delicious. The juices are strong and the meat is fresh. It was served quickly and devoured even quicker.This place is an amazing place to eat dinner. Why spend $500 on a fancy dinner for two when the food is just as good here?

While in Las Vegas, you walk up to the craps table and you got the pass and the don't pass line. Well for me, Earl of Sandwich was definitely a "pass". I came to the Planet Hollywood location to pick up a Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($6) and wasn't impressed with the flavor, breading or amount of chicken. They are suppose to add a spicy jerk sauce but I couldn't taste any additional "bite". When I asked to remove the inside breading, they took a knife and made my roll paper thin compared to pulling out the breading. It's a simple concept; you order and they give you a pager when your sandwich was ready. The staff were young and didn't pay very much attention to customer service. Lots of seating and it can get very busy throughout the day. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but for $6, you can't beat a quick bite on the strip and head back to the craps tables!

AMAZING! BEST SANDWICHES HANDS DOWN!We were just here for NYE and my friend introduced us to this place. I love sandwiches that aren't greasy and that aren't completely filled with bread. This spot is it!!The bread is toasted and crunchy until the last bite, it's also very light and thin which doesn't make you feel super full. We ordered The Montague and Italian w/a side of Broccoli Cheese Soup = BOMB! The roast beef in my Montague sandwich was perfect and the soup was so yummy. Definitely hit the spot.I also tried my friends Cheese Soup and that was really good too! I started dipping my left over bread in her soup because I couldn't get enough!We're coming back here in two weeks and guess where we're going?! EARL OF SANDWICH DUH! ;]

I make sure I hit Earl of Sandwich up AT LEAST once per Vegas trip. I usually order The Earl's Club or The Full Montagu, but I'm going to go ahead and bet that the rest of the sandwiches on their menu are just as good. I'm foaming at the mouth just thinking about them. The ingredients are fresh. The bread is toasted to perfection. The sandwiches aren't all greased out so they feel relatively healthy to eat and you don't feel gross afterwards. Sometimes I'll get a side of Broccoli Cheese Soup w/ my meal. The soup is really good, but nothing special.There's a long line? Not uncommon. Just shut your mouth and get in line. This is the perfect to place to go after a long night of drinking and dancing at the club.

I agree with other yelpers in regretting not coming here more often. This is a very affordable place to eat in Vegas and is very delicious! My party loved it so much we came back the very next day as our last meal in Vegas.Location/parking: Located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino right across from the sports bar.Seating/wait: Quick moving line if you want to order. Better to send someone from your party to find a table during busy times.Service: Order over the counter. Sit and enjoy!Food:-Tomato soup with croutons (I asked for it on the side). This is hands down my favorite tomato soup every. EWW!!! Tomato soup. No really. I usually don't order tomato soup but I've ordered this every time I've been here. I suggest asking for croutons on the side. Otherwise, they come included in the soup and it may be soggy by the time you find a spot to sit.-Potato salad cup from fridge: it's a 2 star. It's as if you got potato salad from a super market.-Sugar cookie: pretty good/ok.-Brownie creme (looks like oreo whoopee): I thought it was ok.-The Earl's club sandwich: Amazing! Club sandwiches are usually all the same but it very god here.-Caribbean Jerk Chick Sandwich: delicious.Can't remember what the other 2 sandwiches were but all delicious.This place is so good. "Earl" of sandwiches is quite demeaning. It should be at least a Duke of Sandwiches.

What a great spot when you are craving something a little more mellow instead of the glutenous buffets that are everywhere in Vegas.  My buddy was raving about this place on the ride up from the OC and claimed that it was the best sandwich shop and blew away the quiznos, togos and subways of the world.  The place is simple... sandwiches with great flavor combinations.  I went with the original classic - roast beef with a light horseraddish sauce on a warm toasted bread... oohhh... makes me hungry now just thinking about it.

Okay so i yelped this place at home so that we can have some pretty cheap eats, because you know vegas, everything is very freaken expensive (sometimes they're good sometimes they're bad) anyways so this was our second to last meal before we leave vegas the next day, so we all got four different sandwiches.....and man were they worth every freaken penny...5.99 to be exact. HOW CAN THIS BE THE BEST AND THE CHEAPEST MEAL WE HAD?! WTF.....seriously it was sooo good that we stopped by again the next day before our drive home and got it again ho ho ho merry christmas ride home with earls of sandwich in our tummy....THE BOMB.COM!

I'm not sure what the hype is about this place. I came here expecting a lot given the large amount of 4-5 star Yelp reviews, and I left disappointed. I ordered the original because I figured that I couldn't go wrong with an original. I guess I should just not expect so much when I eat at a 4-5 star according to Yelp restaurant. The sandwich was tiny. The flavor tasted off because of the horseradish. I was so, so, so disappointed. I also got the chicken noodle soup because it was cold, and I wanted soup. That was average. I'm glad I got the soup or I'd have still been hungry after that tiny sandwich. To be fair, I was eating buffets during the earlier part of my trip to Vegas. But, I still think the sandwich could have been a lot better given all these rave reviews.

I've only been here once and I'm already hooked. In fact, I find myslef dreaming about their sandwiches the way I dream about winning the 355 megamillion lottery. The bread is buttery and crispy. The meat is so tender and flavorful and goes perfectly well with its creamy horseradish sauce. Such a simple and classic combination, but oh-so-flavorful.Earl, you are my new crush. It's a love-hate relationship. I love that it's so tasty, but I hate that there are no locations in OC. I don't need the typical partying excuse to go to Vegas, I just need Earl's.

Came in here at 3 am to get a snack after the club, really like the sandwich here. They are tasty and good for the wallet better than togos, quiznos and subway.  It is located in Planet Hollywood inside the casino at the front of starbucks. It is open 24 hours and the prices are stupid affordable.

Wow.Taking the recommendations from other yelpers, we ordered the Full Montagu, the Caprese, a broccoli and cheddar soup, and an ice cream sandwich made with Ghiradelli chocolate.Everything was amazing. The roast beef was moist and complemented the turkey in the Montagu. The bread was nicely toasted, giving a nice satisfying crunch. The Caprese had a balsamic dressing that tied the sandwich together in such beautiful harmony. Next time I'll ask for the to warm or melt the cheese a bit more; I like my cheese gooey.The broccoli and cheddar soup was like broccoli chunks in cheese soup, but somehow the flavors went well. And of course, how can you go wrong with Ghiradelli?Amazing!! Now I'm curious to see how it would've tasted if they used California Sourdough's sourdough bread... *drools*~*~I couldn't help it. We came back the 3rd time this week and why not? At $6 a sandwich and open 24 hours its probably the cheapest good eats on the strip! Here's what we've sampled so far in my preferred order.1. Full Montagu - just perfect2. Caprese - would order it extra melty next time3. Holiday - the gravy, cranberry, and stuffing is like warm Thanksgiving in my mouth4. Original 1786 - classic roast beef and horseradish5. Italian - nice flavors, but didn't jump at meBrownie creme sandwiches are like giant brownie Oreos. Must have.And if it's hot, the Brownie ice cream sandwiches are just as good.Soups are good too, nice balance, not too salty and good chunky.Did I mention the brownie sandwiches have Ghiradelli chocolate chips in them? Oh YEAH....

I'd like to call myself a sandwich connoisseur, and Earl of Sandwich definitely has some of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten.  It's all about the bread here - amazingly fresh and delicious.  I even went here 2 days in a row - had the Caprese (really good basalmic dressing/sauce) and Tuna melt (who knew it could be so warm and satisfying?).  Even the sides are good - tomato soup, macaroni salad, and coleslaw. Great place to stop by if you're hungry and want something quick to eat.  I would recommend going to Earl of Sandwich over Pink's.

Okay if I could I would give this 24 Hour place a 4.5 Star rating and here's why.I ended up trying this place partially because I wanted to see what the best cheap eats in Las Vegas were. So I went there one day and grabbed a late lunch, and when I took my first bite it was absolutely wonderful. So much better than any sandwich I've had in Canada. I love their full Montagu sandwich, it was tasty, delicious and of great value. (In Canada are food portions are usually smaller than the U.S, so for me the sandwich was a good size.) The bun is always crispy but not hard so that it rips the roof of your mouth. (not a fan of hard breads) and the way that everything just melds is amazingly simple yet is a melt in your mouth experience that is hard to describe.During my stay in Vegas I ate there 3 times and each sandwich has always made my stomach smile. (I remember one was Hawaiian, but I can't remember the 3rd). The only downfall is that if you are a bit of health nut then you may want to watch out for the sodium levels. I know they are quite high. But what most people may not mention is that their salads are absolutely great for the price you pay. Salads are never prepackaged and suffocating in a plastic container. They are made fresh and taste wonderful. The pricing of around 6 bucks for a salad is almost unheard of in Las Vegas. At the end if you're looking for a sandwich and salad meal for under $13 US, definitely go to Earl. You can't get better value. Considering what the cost of other meals in Vegas are, this is a great place for bachelors and people who are with a family and budget conscious.

MmMMmMm Earl of Sandwich is seriously the best hot sandwich ever for $5.99!  I had the full Montagu sandwich and it was mMmMm!  It was roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, tomato, lettuce, and mustard.  Delish!  The bf had the The Earl Club!  It had roasted turkey, bacon, swiss, lettuce, tomato, and the amazing sandwich sauce. There was something about how the sandwich was made. Whether it was having the right proportions, or the ingredients used, or the freshly toasted bread, their sandwiches were just amazing.  If we weren't going on for a buffet later in the evening, the bf was seriously considering a second sandwich because of how much he loved it.  They also had Kona Coffee with free refills for $1.99~ Awesome!If you want a cheap, amazing sandwich, this is the place!  Actually, this is a good place for lunch anyways.  Yum Yum Yum! Thumbs up!

So where's the best place to pigout on the Las Vegas Strip at midnight when all the buffets are closed and you don't feel like eating at a Sit-Down Restaurant?  Earl of Sandwich!!  This was my third trip to the sandwich shop and I can never get tired of their awesome sandwiches.  I was seriously hungry this trip and ordered two sandwiches this time: The Full Montagu and Hawaiian BBQ.  Yes, Earl of Sandwich has officially become my Las Vegas equivalent to Ike's Place.The Full Montagu - Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=VuMLFE1ytKYr8Nntu3irFQ) was everything I expected it to be.  A sandwich that's loaded with meat and has some kick to it.  It was very tasty!!The Hawaiian BBQ -  Grilled Chicken, Roasted Ham, Hawaiian BBQ Sauce, Aged Swiss Cheese & Fresh Pineapple (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=LSuzXyK62n2wfMV_cN69tQ).  This one really took me by surprise.  It was like biting into a Hawaiian Pizza with tangy BBQ sauce.  Very strange combination, but it surprisingly worked.Like the same cost of all their sandwiches, both of them cost only $5.99 each and then I washed everything down with Earl's Grey Lemonade.  It was a great late night pigout session for less than $17!  I will be back here again!!  Love this place!

The sandwiches are good, but not worth a cab ride here. They're hot, crispy and gooey all at the same time, but they're only a small step above a Quiznos sub.As suggested by Yelpers, my boyfriend and I got the Jerk Chicken sandwich, which was not spicy AT ALL, but still very good. My boyfriend got the Hawaiian, which I thought was better than the Jerk Chicken for flavor.What they have on their side is the price, but not if you have to take a cab to get here. If you're in the hotel, this is a perfectly good no-frills place to grab a sandwich.

Best Sandwiches in the world and i am not kidding! Too bad they only have a few locations throughout the USA but who cares! ITS THE BEST IN THE WORLD! I eat at Earl's at least 3 times every vegas trip!I Will begin reviewing each sandwich shortly...Carribean Jerk Chicken Sandwich:My personal favorite on the menu! I love the banana peppers and the right amount of spicyness of this sandwich. I even add Tabasco Sauce to kick it up a little bit! This is a must have if you have never been to Earl before.  MY PERSONAL FAVORITE!Italian Sandwich:Italian sandwiches are great wherever you go but this certainly is one of the best sandwiches on the menu. Make sure you eat it right away while its hot and order the delicious salt n vinegar chips to go along with it!Tuna Sandwich:One of the simplest sandwiches on the menu with it having only 2 ingredients on the inside, Albacore tuna and swiss cheese.  The bread is of course what makes this sandwich but every sandwich is served hot and this hot tuna sandwich was SUPERB!The Original:If you're into Horse Raddish and Roast Beef this is awesome! I also love the earl's spicy mustard they put to add some kick to it!Earl's frozen Lemonade: EXCELLENT! Just like the frozen lemonade you buy at disneyland. Cheap too!Caprese Sandwich:If you've ever been to italy or just had mozarella and tomato Caprese or just enjoy something without meat, this sandwich does the trick. Too bad they dont make this smaller, because it would be a great appetizer.Kono Coffee:Not bad, I prefer walking to Coffee Bean inside miracle mile!

I've been wanting to try it since I first saw an Earl of Sandwich at Walt Disney World. I finally got my chance this past trip. I liked it so much I went back the next night. My favorite items were the tomato soup and the holiday sandwich. The holiday sandwich was their special. I wish they'd serve it year-round. I've been craving Earl of Sandwich lately. Someone please open a franchise in Southern California!

I was staying at Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile mall is right next door.  Rather that eat a "food court" lunch I decided to try the Earl of Sandwich, which is at the front of the Miracle Mile entrance.I ordered a tuna melt, which I wanted cold.  The sandwich came out hot - the manger explained that the bread had to be baked and he offered to remake the sandwich, bake the bread, then add the ingredients.Rather than wait, I went ahead with the tuna melt and I was pleasantly surprised.  The bread was excellent, and the tuna and cheese inside was very good.  This is also one of the less expensive meals I have had in Vegas - all in all a good deal and highly recommended.

My favorite sandwich shop at my favorite hotel! I have tried most of the sandwiches, but my favorite is the Montagu. Gotta love that roast beef! I love coming here when I start the day in Vegas, but it's best enjoyed after a night of dancing at the finest clubs on the strip. I love that they can make a presentable, delicious, decently-priced sandwich without making me wait forever-even when there is a line snaking around the Planet Hollywood casino. Try it while you're in Vegas, you won't be disappointed!

This is my GO-TO eatery in LV. I seriously cannot stay away. I think at one point I ate here 3 or maybe 4 times in one day. You can't go wrong. I, however, always ALWAYS seem to order the tuna melt. I've ordered several other items, all equally as good as one another, but the tuna melt is what stands out for me.Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be sure to try and smuggle some home, although, they may all miraculously disappear before my plane has landed.

Conveniently located in Planet Hollywood, right by the entrance to the Miracle Mile shops and close enough to the casino. I enjoyed the original 1762. The hot sandwich didn't have much (roast beef, cheddar cheese, and horseradish sauce with no veggies), but it was perfect the way it was. Juicy roast beef that wasn't overcooked with the cheese melted right on top. Their coffee is quite good too. The place is open 24 hours, so it's a great place to pick up a meal at any time of day.

I don't really like sandwiches but I LOVE the Earl of Sandwich sandwiches.The first time I was here, it was 3am and I had just flown into Las Vegas and my tuna melt was delicious. Judging by the long line, many people agreed.The second time I was here, it was midday and the place was just as packed. The cashiers were really nice and friendly. Once again, I had to order the tuna melt. I love getting the sandwich and it's so hot it burns your fingers. I know it's definitely fresh. I take a bite; the cheese is so smooth, the bread is soft, and the tuna is delicious. Man! I loved the sandwich so much! I was so sad when it was gone. I am definitely coming back.My friend also decided to get the Earl Grey lemonade, which was surprisingly really good! I'm going to get that too when I come back to Vegas.

Okay. So here's the deal.You go to a few different sandwich shops on different days to pick up some goods to indulge your nom nom feeling. Say you like the BLT or the Club and that's what you get every time, regardless.  You choose these because you focus on the what's being sandwiched between the two pieces of bread.  The bread is seriously just some edible cushion to keep your hands from getting messy from eating the goodness of what's inside the sandwich.  It's the law of sandwich bread.You come in Earl of Sandwich and that law is completely broken. You can get ANY sandwich, and despite which one you get, it WILL be a winner.  The highlight of each sandwich IS the bread. It's perfectly toasted on the outside and warm and fluffy in the inside. It truly disgusts me to even think about how beautiful sandwich bread could be. A dinky picture and even this review can barely describe the wonders of their bread. You're probably thinking, "Damn, this girl is seriously trippin' about the bread", and you know what? Yeah, I am. It's seriously that good. Okay, thats enough on bread.The Full Montagu is very delicious and the roast beef was tender.The Club tasted so fresh and the bacon gave it a nice crunch.The Carribean Jerk is a must have if you want loads of flavor in your sandwich.I've also tried some of their wonderfully made soups:Tomato Soup- was thick, creamy, and had croutons in it. My boyfriend ordered the food while I was away in one of the stores, and the soup was sitting for awhile. I came back, all sad faced, because the croutons were going to be soggy.... or atleast that's what I thought. It was 100% crunchy and the soup was at a perfect hot temperature. If you like tomato soup, it's a MUST have.Broccoli Cheese Soup- was also very creamy and flavorful. It was thick and chunky, but not too thick where it had the consistency of porridge ( a red flag for me to send it away ). Expect to stand in a line during hungry hours; You get a pager when your food is ready. Trust me, its worth the wait! The sandwiches are your ordinary sandwich prices and soups are also well priced. I honestly believe it tastes like a million bucks though.... nothing compares to these sandwiches.One of the best parts is, is that my hotel was a 3 minute walking distance from Planet Hollywood ( @ the Marriot ) and I literally could walk here ANY part of the day/night ( 24-hour service!!!! ) to grab a nomster sandwich.I'm seriously coming here EVERY time I visit Vegas!PS--Beware of staring at random people in that area, you may get punched to the face and knocked down to the ground. My friend did, atleast. HAHAHAHAHHA. Sucks.

The sandwiches are all $5.99 and for a decent portion too. The sandwiches are reallyt good but the thing that sticks out most about it is the bread. Its soft like a ciabatta bread and just ties in all the flavors. I tried the Full Montague and it was soooooooooooooooooooooooo good. It had roast beef, turkey, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and though it sounds simple, the hot sandwich satisfies, ESPECIALLY for such a cheap price!It was so good that I just HAD to come back 4am in the morning to grab another one for my bf to try back home. STILL delicious!

One of the people in our group also stayed there last time he was in Vegas, and the one request he made for this trip was that we eat at Earls.  Few things you should know.  Each sandwich is only $5.99.  It is open 24 hours.  And it is RIDONKULOUSLY good.Seriously.  I'm not joking around - if you are anywhere near PH, you MUST give this place a try.  If you like sandwiches in general, or hot sandwiches specifically, or just delicious bread - you won't go wrong.The one sandwich our group didn't like was the Hawaiian...they said it was sort of sour.  The faves were probably the full montague & the italian.  YUM YUM YUM!!!

Best sandwich place i've been to. Although I may be a little bias since I was starving when I stopped by this place. I heard it was good so I thought I'd give it a try. It is open 24 hours---how perfect! It's cheap! About $6 for a sandiwich---it might look a little small but it's stuffed with food so it'll be sure to fill you.The line is a bit long, but they go through it pretty quickly...I got the tuna melt and it was just amazing. Soft bread, chewy, cheesy, warm---everything you'd want in a sandwich! They give you buzzers to hang out to while your sandwich is being prepared, and there is not much of a wait so you'll get your food fast!I definitely recommend stopping by here! Amazingly delicious, affordable food...open 24 hours? What are you doing still reading this review? Go!

Alright my very first review! And what a way to start it off with this place. I'm a big time sandwich girl and earls is the best I've ever had....so far. I got the Caribbean jerk chicken and it was deeee-lish! I went to the location at the planet Hollywood las Vegas. Everything about the sandwich was amazing up until the very last bite. I craved it so much, that when I got back home to SD I went straight to panera just to fulfill my cravings. I hope one will open up in SD soon!

Delicious! Came at lunch time & line was pretty long, but totally worth the wait. Came on National Soup Day & got a coupon for a free creamy tomato soup w/ fresh cheesy croutons! I had the Earl Club, which was good, but a bit too salty cause of the bacon. The next day I came back the next night after XS (cuase they're open 24 hrs, haaay- late night drunk munches) & got the All American with turkey, buttermilk ranch & cranberries. It sounds a bit weird, but it was delicious! I've heard that this place compares to Nor Cal's Ikes Sandwiches, but it's a bit different. There's not as many to choose from, but it is equally delicious. A must try if you get the chance! Oh & all sandwiches are only $5.99, score!

A cheap mouth-watering hot sandwich that's open 24 hours? It can't get any better than that. I had the pleasure of going here after clubbing at around 4AM and it was heaven in my mouth. I had the Tuna melt and its the best one i've had by far. They make their own bread and it just kills me that it has to disappear into my belly.  It was soo good that we ate here again the next day.  This place is affordable and goes to show that you can still enjoy vegas even if you are on a tight budget. I wish they open one up in California preferably in Norcal!

Open 24 hrs and awesome sandwiches all day...what is not to like? The sandwiches are great but have to be eaten right away. I tried taking one back to my room and it just wasn't the same. All of the sandwiches are toasted to order and you have to wait a minute for them to come up....but its worth it. Get there before 11am and you'll get to try one of the breakfast sandwiches...the BLT was delicious. The lunch line got a little crazy but they got through it pretty quickly. Its certainly "fast" food.

At our recent Vegas trip, we stayed at the PH Westgate Towers and this joint was situated nicely in the hotel.  It will now be a staple for us every time we're in need of a good sandwich.  We tried the Earl's Club and the Full Montagu (both hot).  I don't know what they put in their sandwiches...maybe crack (j/k)??  The sandwiches were awesomely delicious!  My only complaint is that I wished they were bigger!

What is there left to say when 653 other Yelpers have already spilled the beans about the Earl of Sandwich? There was only one thing left to do which was to see what the hype was all about myself. The place is located inside the Planet Hollywood across from the sports book. It's open 24/7 for all you lovely belligerent and drunk, 5 inch heels in hand meaning blackened Hobbit feet, crusted yack on chin folks. The Earl just might be your savior.For a measly $5-6, you can get a nice, freshly made and toasted sandwich. There are many options to choose from such as the classic club to the Hawaiian bbq. Of course there are other items on the menu like their rich tomato soup (I recommend the croutons on the side), salads, wraps, and so forth. The word about the Earl of Sandwich is out so don't go bezerk if you see a pessimistic long line. Their efficient staff will keep the lines steadily moving and it shouldn't take too long for the orders to be called. The only downfall is possibly the seating for it may fill up quickly.On our most recent trip to Sin City, we stopped by Earl's twice due to the fact that we stayed at PH and so it was always a short walk away. On a random note, I would like to state that for some odd reason I enjoyed the sandwiches from Earl the next morning after it was left out over night more than straight out of the oven. Perhaps it was the hangover munchies?Give the Earl a hollar if you're ever in the (702) area code.

The Earl of Sandwich is a great sandwich place in Planet Hollywood.  It's fast, convenient, and affordable.  I like the way they toast the bread and when you bite into your sandwich you get this nice, satisfying crunch.  For those of you walking down the strip and is in need for something very cheap and good go visit The Earl of Sandwich.

huh.... #1 on "Hot on Yelp" on the Yelp homepage for Las Vegas. I was expecting some expensive 5-star restaurant. But when I think about it, Earl of Sandwich is something I always crave on my Vegas trip.Not only is it the best drunk food (opened late), it's also perfect for lunch and dinner. It's located in the casino part (not the mile shops) of Planet Hollywood. Every time I come here, my go-to sandwich is the cannonball. Delicious bread, meatballs, marinara, and gooey cheeeeese. Simple, yet gorgeous.My boyfriend and I shared one as an after-club snack and on the last bite of my boyfriend's sandwich, he dropped the last meatball on the floor. In all honesty, it was the saddest part of our night. So sad that we talked about it the next morning, very true story.It's that good, man.

I've eaten here three times on three separate occasions when I'm in Vegas.Each time I come here ... AMAZING. The artisan bread that they use for their hot sandwiches is simply divine. I've tried the Veggie Sandwich - very, very fresh with an almost Mediterranean taste.The Full Montagu is my absolute favorite sandwich as of right now. They juicy and thinly sliced turkey breasts as well as roast beef just melts in your mouth as you bite into crisp lettuce and tomatoes. Top it off with some extra Dijon mustard & tabasco sauce and I am in H.E.A.V.E.N.The sandwiches are ~$5.99I sometimes get a bowl of Tomato soup (which looks red on the screen, but comes out orange when you take off the lid). I think they mix a lot of cheddar cheese with the tomato soup because it's super creamy & rich. They put a bunch of croutons in the soup bowl so when you open the lid they are swimming in front of your face =)AHHH Earl of Sandwich.... until we meet again.

Damn good sandwiches.  Only $5.99, and they're fast, too.  I eat there every time I stay at Planet Hollywood.  Full Montagu is great, Caribbean Jerk Chicken is my favorite. It's right across the hallway from the sportsbook.  Try it, you'll be hooked.

Thank you Earl. You were open 24hours for both my drunkeness and my hangover. Your sandwiches are warm and soft, yet crunchy and fresh. The food wasn't too heavy but it was filling.

Pros: Tomato soup, BLT, open 24 hoursCons: Kinda pricey for a sandwichCame here on my last trip to Vegas and I'm pretty impressed. Although, they're known for their roast beef, I ended up ordering their BLT sandwich.  The bacon was nice and smokey. What really makes the sandwich, however, is the bread. It's nice and toasted. Booyah.I also ordered a tomato soup that also hit the spot.Although I ate here during dinner, they're also open 24 hours. If I were drunk and looking for a late night bite, I'd definitely come by here again.

Here's a math question for everyone. If I was in Vegas for 3 days and went to Earl of Sandwich 3 times, how many sandwiches did I eat? A. 3B. 4C. This question can not be solved.D. A & CE. B & CBrings back painful memories of the SATs, huh? The correct answer is E! Yes, this question is totally ambiguous but, it's also true that I ate 4 sandwiches in 3 visits. And as icing on the cake, I had a bite of my friends Tuna Melt. I've had half the sandwiches on their menu and I've never had one I didn't like. It's an addiction and really the BIGGEST reason I would continually stay at PH Towers. And at $6.48 (tax included) a pop, you can save the money, eat like a king or queen, and then blow your new found savings on Wheel of Fortune. But seriously, these are the best sandwiches I've ever had in my entire existence on Earth. Period.

A 5 star review for a sandwich shop?  YES!  As far as sandwiches go, this is the place I fantasize about.  And I always come crashing down in flames as I realize that I live 4 hours away from Las Vegas...it is a very, very sad moment.  The Jerk Chicken: So creamy, and there is such dynamic flavor.  I just ate it up! (Pun very much intended) Cannonballs (meatball sub): excellent.  If you like meatball subs, you'll like their's.  I'm on a mission to try more.  I encourage all you yelpers and readers to try this the next time you're on the strip in Las Vegas.  Planet Hollywood.

One of the best sandwiches I've ever had! I love that there still exists a place on the strip to get cheap, quality food. All of their sandwiches and salads are $5.99 and packed with quality and flavor. Best of all, they're open 24 hours! Luckily for me, I stayed in the Westgate Towers at Planet Hollywood so we were only a stone's throw away from Earl's. Among my group of friends, I bet we hit this place up at least 5 times a day. My favorite is the club sandwich. The bread, ingredients, and special sandwich sauce they put in all meld together perfectly. Their chicken caesar salad is also delicious (croutons were on the salty side but no matter). Yes, the line can get long but it goes by really fast. Clubs, gambling, and other shenanigans are fun but Earl's is definitely gonna be my reason for returning to Vegas.

I will always make time to go here when I'm in Vegas since it's the CLOSEST to me! Ohh fresh hot sandwiches so flavorful and so perfectly toasted! The price is amazing too. Totally affordable after you've lost it all in Vegas. The warmth of the sandwiches inside your tummy will make you feel much much better. I want some now that I'm thinking about it. Oh, I ordered the signature sandwich as well as the meatball one. Next time I go I'm going to try something different having faith that it won't disappoint.

So for the first food trip of LV 2011 is.................Earl's! Huh?  Not a buffet???!  Nope...we were hungry, in a rush and wanted to spend less than $10.Located right in the Miracle Mile Shops and PH Casinos....I'm glad I get to experience this place the first chance we get because every time we walked past them since...it's been long lines and packed packed packed.  The lines are so ridiculous long that my buddies and I termed it....Loser Lane....hehe....where you lost big in gambling....trying to get cheap food/kill time at the same time :)I ordered the Roast Beef sandwich with horseradish cream sauce and veggies.  I tend to always order the Roast Beef at every new sandwich shop I go to...so this place is no different.  Add into the fact that most of the crew ordered their special or the Italian....so I chose to be different.All I can is...my sandwich is juicy..tender...tastes great with the creamy horseradish sauce all for under $10.  I wished the portion was bigger though...and...well....let's just say the rest of the night of drinking hit me harder than it should because there's not enough food in my tummy :(Overall, pretty good sandwich to check out if you are sick of buffets, trying to kill time and don't want to gamble.

If you had to eat at only 1 place in Las Vegas, this would be it.  Located conveniently in Planet Hollywood, it's the best $5.99 (add $2.99 if you want a cup of soup) you'll spend in Vegas.   I am so in love with Earl of Sandwich (and I've eaten there only twice) I'm questioning whether I have enough funds to open my own franchise.   But it's just a sandwich you say?  Yes, it is, but it is totally delicious.  The sandwiches come wrapped in gold foil, and it's like a hot little brick, all ready for your consumption.

I'm breaking away from the herd here to say I've had better. I had the original. The bread was awesome, but the roast beef so rare it bled into the bread which was just gross. Ick. Just a small amount of cheese and sauce. Granted it was cheap and convenient, but after reading all these reviews I was expecting a party in my mouth and it just didn't happen.I was glad to see I could get a beer with my sandwich but it almost doubled the cost of my lunch for a bottle. Desserts were wrapped in plastic, mostly brownies and the tops of cupcakes (I forget what they called them) but they looked just like the brownies.The men in our group loved this. The women all felt like I did. Perhaps it's a man thing?

WHERE'S THE EXTRA CREDIT BUTTON TO GIVE THIS PLACE SIX STARS. yes... i want to give extra credit. tried it for the very first time in vegas last weekend... figured "hey, gotta try the original sandwich". One bite into it, i was like, "HOLLLLLLLLLLY cow, that is one good roast beef sandwich" (get the bad joke? get it?) lame jokes aside, if ppl r looking for something quick, YUMMY, fast, convenient, YUMMY and YUMMY, this place is the place to go on the strip. Location is perfect for people staying at the Cosmopolitan for it is right across the strip. Highly recommended for people visiting vegas.

Earl of Sandwich is a pretty stellar sandwich place that's very, very good. But I have to stay I was still expecting a little bit more judging from all the praise that it was getting. Besides, four stars does mean that I'm a fan, right? Located in Planet Hollywood, it was one of the few places that I ate at during the weekend we spent in Vegas, and among everything, it was probably the best. The place is open 24 hours so that alone, earns my respect.Surprisingly, even with the long line, it moves pretty rapidly. For larger groups, better have someone reserve your table. Even then, people demand chairs like they belong to them so you may be treated to some rude displays of human beings being human beings. I got a Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich, which is basically a chicken sub with spicy sauce, red peppers and banana peppers. For the most part, the sub was pretty fresh but occassionally, I would get half a pepper that was stale or slightly crusty. I wasn't sure whether it was just dry or toasted too much. Either way, that's a no-no.Sandwiches run at about $6-8. Earl of Sandwich is a fitting name, it's definitely no King.

I've come here on every Vegas trip for one simple reason..BOMB ASS $6 SANDWICHES!! I think I've tried 6-7 of their sandwiches and 2 of their wraps; everything hit the spot. My favorites were the "Original 1762" and "Full Montagu." The horseradish and mustard sauces, respectively, really brought the flavors of the sandwiches together. But let's be honest, you cant go wrong with any of the other sandwiches they have. Thank God that they're open 24 hours; this place makes for some good drunk food. But it doesn't matter the level of inebriation you're in EAT HERE!

I was so excited to come to Vegas just for this place. My friends that have been here before raved about it, so this was at the top of my list of places to try in Vegas. I couldn't believe the sandwiches are only $5.99! WOW! I had a bit of difficulty deciding between several sandwiches, but my veteran friends were telling me to try the Full Montagu. So I did. IT WAS AMAZING! The roast beef was really tender, the bread was toasted perfectly (I hate soggy sandwich bread), the ingredients were fresh, and amazing flavor! I finished the whole thing...and such occurrences are few and far between. I wasn't even that hungry! That's how good the sandwich was. I will DEFINITELY come back again to try a different sandwich. Plenty of seating is a plus; our group was rather large and we combined a few tables.I was rather sad that most of the places in Vegas don't have free wifi...but Earl of Sandwich has it's own FREE wifi! COOL! Thank you EOS, I will be back!

Maybe it was because I was a bit buzzed when I ate at this place or maybe it was because I got drunk off my ass after eating at this place or maybe it was just the sound of chips shuffling, coins banging and slot machines beeping (?)...all I can say is I don't remember much about this place.BUT, what I do remember was this place has AWESOME sandwiches.  I LOVE sandwiches and this place is one of the best ever, especially for the price you get!

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE! I got the chicken caesar wrap last time, but everything on their menu is excellent. I stole a bite from my friend's tuna melt and I've been dreaming about it ever since...I might just have to take a trip to Vegas to get my fix.Is it just me or did anyone notice the significance of "Earl of Sandwich?" The word "earl" is associated with "sovereign prince," "ruler of designated territory," "duke," etc (according to Wiki)...Like John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester. HELLO?! Is it just me or is this revelation AWESOME? Earl of Sandwich...the person still remains nameless, but nevertheless, this mysterious person is still the earl...of sandwich.UPDATE:My friend just told me that there actually was an Earl of Sandwhich, Edward Montagu, of Sandwhich, Kent, England and I sorta, kinda, maybe, slightly feel stupid, but whatevers. Earl of Sandwhich still rocks!

Mr. Reliable. This place is amazing. Late night snack at it's finest. It's not too big, it's not too small but it's juuuuuuuust right. In my two day stint in the area I had "The Original", "Italian" and the "Caribbean Jerk Chicken" which was my favorite. The bread is perfectly toasted the fillings were just perfectly seasoned, juicy and flavorful. To top it off it's open 24/7. I mean damn if my room was next to it I would be sneaking a snack every couple of hours. Enough can't be said about this place so I'll keep it short since I'm since yelpers all seem to agree already.

OMG, you have to try the "Holiday Sandwich." It's got turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo, and gravy. It's a yummy Thanksgiving feast slapped between toasty bread. Beware of the food coma aftereffects. Shame though that the sandwich is not a regular menu item. It's only offered during the holidays (hence the name :P )

Every time I come to Vegas, I really look forward to these sandwiches. They're simple, they're affordable, they're open late and they're delicious!I was first introduced to these sandwiches when my family and I were exploring Plant Hollywood's Miracle Mile shops and the then "new" PH Westgate condos. We stopped by here after one of the hostess recommended it and I've been a fan ever since.I enjoy the variety they offer, especially on their signature hot sandwich menu. I've had a couple and they are all tasty. These are a couple of my favorites, depending on what food mood I am in.For a tasty well-rounded sandwich, I'd go with The Full Montagu (Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce).For something tangy and sweet, I'd go with the Caribbean Jerk Chicken (Grilled Chicken, Roasted Red & Banana Peppers & Spicy Jerk Sauce).For something healthy and light I'd go with the Caprese (Fresh Mozzarella, Roma Tomato, Fresh Basil & Drizzled Balsamic Vinaigrette).One of my favorites remains the Italian because of my love for salami. (Salami, Capicola, Ham, Mortadella, Zesty Italian Dressing, Mozzarella & Roma Tomato (Peppers Optional).A great place to eat, no matter what time of the day.I'd also recommend their ice cream brownie sandwich because the brownie "halves" are rich and filling.
