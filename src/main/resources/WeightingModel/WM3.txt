Great sandwich, but it's no 'Wichcraft. This is a hearty, meaty grilled sandwich. Good, but just not breathtaking.

NOM NOM. I can't wait to go back to Vegas just to have this (sounds kind of lame, but it's 73% true...and I don't know how I got that percentage).Got the The Earl's Club. It was so yummy! It was like the turkey, bacon, and cheese came together and was like "we're going to plan this awesome party in Tiffany's mouth." They succeeded - oh yes, they did.Price: Great, good for someone who is safe with their money.Overall: Great sandwiches, good price, nommy nom nom (can't say this enough).

Holy Moses Smell the Roses, this place is GREAT!!!! $5.99 for a hot sandwich, wow that is fabulous.  The menu is diverse and the food is GREAT.  We arrived after a long flight and grabbed a sandwich, after drinking for 6 hours I found myself back in line for another one!For the quality of the sandwich they could charge double.

When you got the munchies, midnight snack, after clubbing or whatever this is a major must!Opens 24 hours a day which is perfect for Vegas.  Located in Planet Hollywood.Reason why it's only 4 stars? Always crowded. Takes too damn long to get my freaking sandwich that I would have probably passed out from my drunkeness.  About an 1/2 -1 hour wait. Italian: yummy pizza sandwichEarl's club: mmm....classic with a lil kick and zest from the sauceHam and cheese: deliciously cheeseyEverything is on ciabatta bread for the low price of $5.99!

This place is the real deal!! I couldn't even keep track of how many times I stopped by this place to get a sandwich! This place made my stay at Planet Hollywood worth it! 24/7 awesome hot sandwiches is the best thing ever...now on to the good stuff...My absolute fave was the ham and cheese. The mustard alone that was on this sandwich was to die for...and I about did by choking on the 2nd bite from trying to jam it in my face! The best BLT pretty much lived up to the name. This thing was tasty. The classic roast beef was pretty great also. The horseraddish sause again...was amazing. This place exceded my expectations and was only like $6 a sandwich. You can't beat that in Vegas! The line was never too busy while I was there, but also it was during the week, I can imagine weekends would be busier. Now if only I had an Earl closer to me I would be set. When I go to move, I am taking Earl's locations into consideration!

This is a very popular sandwich place in Vegas in the PH hotel.  There's usually a line but it goes by fairly quick.  I usually get the full montagu and a side of soup.  The sandwiches aren't the biggest in the world but they are high in quality.  If you're in a the mood for a light lunch after a night (or nights) of drinking, and you don't mind waiting in line, this would be a good stop.

Open 24/7 means drunk muchies. For about $7- $8 you get an overall pretty decent sandwich.Sizewise I would say it's an 7inch ciabatta bread...I had the Earl's club, which is turkey and bacon with sauce/tomatoes/lettuce on top.  Not too bad, not too bad at all.  Definitely one of the most moist turkey I've ever had! The bread and everything put together was excellent.  The cashier was very friendly as well as she entertainedsome of us drunkies while waiting for our sandwiches! :)

"You're in Vegas? You have to try Earl of Sandwich!"says my friend.So while waiting for my friends to wake up, I decided to walk over to PH and try this place. First of all, where are the darn signs? I couldn't find it LOLand no, I wasn't drunk or anything. This was around 11am. I finally got there and there was a line but it was moving really past. I probably spent less than 5 minutes in line. Ordered the Earl Club.I didn't quite like the cheese but I liked everything else.And even though it's not a foot long, it's still very filling and they don't skimp you on the meat.Definitely a Vegas must-try!

I came to this place twice during my three day stay in Las Vegas. My friend kept on telling me that this place had good sandwiches, and she was right! I first tried this place around 12:30am - 1am, so it's good if you have a late night craving.The first sandwich that I had was the Caribbean jerk chicken. This was my first experience with jerk chicken, and it was full of flavor. The bread was also nice and toast as well. The second time I went I tried the Earl club. Out of the two sandwiches that I tried I would say that the Earl club was better, because of there were more ingredient to add to the flavor. Both sandwiches however were equally good, and I would order them again.What's really nice about this place is that they take your order really fast, and they make your sandwiches fast as well. There's also the added perks of being open late when you want a late night snack or something. In addition, all the sandwiches are 5.99, which is pretty good considering that things are usually more expensive in Vegas, especially on the strip.

First of all, let me just say how long I've waited to try Earl of Sandwich (over a year), how excited I was to try Earl of Sandwich (fuckin excited), and then how pissed I was when I couldn't even take a picture of the thing because it was so pathetic-looking (really fuckin pissed).I think like six of my friends ordered the Full Montagu, so I decided to go with the Original. It usually doesn't get much safer than "the Original," but I was so disappointed. No, I was devastated at how much of a letdown this sandwich was. The bread is good, but it was the best part about the sandwich. The fuckin BREAD. I could tell that Earl was going with a completely different concept with his sandwich than Ike (@ Lime). Whereas Ike mindfucks you with an avalanche of ingredients and flavors, Earl keeps his sandwiches as simple as possible. My Original had bread, meat, and sauce. That's it. I wanted so badly to appreciate the simplistic beauty of it, but I couldn't. It's just too boring.I had a bite of the Full Montagu, I was not impressed. I had a bite of the Italian. I was decently impressed. I've heard good things about the Hawaiian, so I'll come back to try that. If it sucks too, then I am done with you Earl. You've literally broken my heart. Bastard.

Wow... YUM! My boyfriend can't stop talking about this place after we had gone. The only complaint I have is that the sandwiches are kind of small so we still felt hungry afterwards, but didn't want to stand in line. Both sandwiches we had were very delicious, but were gone so quick!I'm really glad they have grey poupon mustard on the tables because it made my sandwich taste yummier!

A (didn't quite get the + though... still good!) their Original was yumskies too! the  roast beef was moist, opposed to the usual dry fast food-y roast beef.several of my friends ordered the Earl's Club, and everyone got their  smoked bacon in the sandwich....besides one. hehehe i thought that was pretty funny.the only downside to this place is the limited seating.  but if you're drunk on the strip (or DRUNKINTHEPOOL!), you can eat that sheez on-the-go!24hours! immediate like.

I got the Full Montagu sandwich and first bite of it sorta transported me back to my childhood  visit to Montreal Quebec Canada where they  have the most delicious roast beef and corned beef sandwiches similar in taste to this Earl sandwich. My meal could of been perfect if I opted to not get the frozen lemonade. That was such a sugar bomb where I had to down so much water to wash the sweetness out of my mouth. Still 4  stars for something that can transport you to a time back in the past! :) The line to get the sandwich is pretty long but moves pretty fast  but friend and I were stuck in line still for a good 15 minutes before we got to the cashier.

Wow, this is as good as cheap sandwiches get. We actually went here twice during our stay because of how good it was. The bread is amazing, while there was always a long line it moved a lot faster than expected. If you're looking for grub near Planet Hollywood, this is a great spot to grab it.Pros: (all the sandwiches we shared)-Caribbean Jerk Sandwich - my personal favorite because I like a little kick. -Hawaiian BBQ Sandwich - great combo.-Earl Club Sandwich - This one was good and then continued to grow on me as I ate it. -Original Sandwich - Classic roast beef and cheese.-Earl potato chips - reminded me a lot of Boulder Chips. Love them.-Frozen Earl Lemonade - sour but not too sour, I kicked it up a notch by buying a shot of vodka across the way.Cons: -Long Line (but not that bad, it moves faster than you think and it gives you time to look at a menu)Do yourself a favor and stop by the Earl of Sandwich.

I drool for this stuff and want to come back to Vegas just for that. For only $6 per sandwich and the food just hits the spot!! At first, Yvonne N. told me to order it, she highly HIGHLY reccomended it and I was like ehhh why would I come here for a tuna melt, then I bit into this heavenly combination of hot, soft, and crisp bread and juicy tuna salad that melts in your mouth with the "ooz" of swiss chese...

So this place was REALLY hyped up for me since we had a friend that loooooves this place; it lived up to the hype thankfully!Earl is located in the Miles mall of Planet Hollywood. Their bread is made slightly undercooked so that it cooks and toasts fully when the sandwich goes through the conveyor oven with all the filling. Everything was really really good; the bread was always perfectly toasted and piping hot. We ate:Hawaiian: A little too salty, will not get againFull Montagu: REALLY GOOD!Earl's Club: Friends said really goodThe Original: Also goodGet the full montagu and earl's club definitely. 2 mornings in a row we got the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich too - really really good. They serve breakfast until 11, but you can get the other sandwiches any time you want. The kona coffee they serve is also pretty good :). We will be back!!!

We were looking for something to satisfy our hunger and walking into the Miles Mall this was the first place we ran into. There wasn't a line as we went there on a Saturday afternoon. You can pick your sandwich and add chips and drink to your order. They give you the buzzer and you wait for your sandwich to get done.I ordered the All American sandwich, which had roasted turkey and cranbarry sauce in it. It was very tasty and everybody else liked their sandwiches too. It tasted very fresh and the bread was soft in the inside and crunchy on the outsite. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly and helpfull. Would definitely go back there.

There are a lot of cool things about this buffet that no other place has but most of it was pretty average or subpar.  Having shawarma on a spit is an awesome idea but it wasn't that good.  Risotto is something different but it was pretty meh.  Crab stir fried in some kinda butter sauce might sound appetizing but I would rather just have a plate full of cold crab legs and crack them myself.  They had the most lamb I'd ever seen in a Vegas buffet including ribs, leg and mini chops (prob my favorite thing in the whole place).  I also enjoyed the different individualized portions of pasta.  Wish I had more room for dessert.   And what's with the bottles of water they bring to the table?  There's a reason why every other buffet gives patrons those huge tumblers of water.  So the servers can deal with other stuff...like taking finished plates off the table.  Some of our plates sat there for a pretty long time before they got picked up.  We also had to repeatedly ask for more water and coffee before they actually brought it.  I can think of at least 5 buffets in town I would rather go to than this one for the price though.  Might be a one and done for me.

Once you walk into the Cosmopolitan Hotel, there's this huge center bar with a chandelier-like architect of beads strung around the bar from the second floor.  It looks pretty cool the way everything is draped.  The buffet was quite the walk through an open and quite empty hallway and lounge area and when we got there the line wasn't even that long at all.  They charge a ridiculous amount for alcoholic drinks (like $12+) but I guess it's Vegas, or then it was the holidays. Well, to the point, the food was pretty good.  Some portions are individually baked so you have to grab the small baking dish but it takes up space on the plate. Not to mention the plates are quite small so get ready to head up to the buffet quite a few times.  Dessert section was amazing! The chefs have a flair for design but they taste as amazing as they look.

Great selection of food for a great price. Most lunch buffets were much more expensive and the lines are horrible. Because this hotel just opened up recently I dont think too many people know about it yet so this is the best time to check it out if you can. The decor and silverware used is nice. Our group really enjoyed our meal that day.

This is my new favorite buffet (title previously held by the still very good Studio B at M Resort). Wicked Spoon tries to be a little different and they succeed in many ways. I'm giving them a 5 for now, even though they do have a few issues that will hopefully be ironed out once they are open longer. Based on reviews from other Yelpers, they seem to still be trying out different things since some of the items mentioned by others were not present when I was there and I'm sure I had some things that others did not have. I ended up eating here twice my last trip. I enjoyed it so much I cancelled my steakhouse reservation to eat at Wicked Spoon again. The items were definitely different on both nights. Even the presentation was different on some of the items. They have a really good cold bar. I ate several of the crab and shrimp cocktails. This is a great place for those who have eaten at all the other buffets and are looking for a change of pace. I lost count of the number of items they offered that you really can't get at any other buffet. While other new buffets try to be more and more extravagant, this one tries to be different. with great results. My favorite item was the blackened lamb ribs. Now for the areas that need improvement. Service is definitely an issue. The line moves slow, although I think that can be credited largely to the buffet being new and people are still getting used to their jobs. It seems like they will eventually have some self serve kiosks, but they were not being used when I was there. The servers also seem to be overwhelmed. They may want to consider hiring more servers since the nature of this buffet (small plates, pans, baskets, bottles, etc.) generates more that needs clearing. That being said, the service was friendly and very good, if a little slow. The servers seemed really proud to be there though, which is always a good thing. They also need to stock cold plates in the cold bar and dessert sections. The dessert selection is a bit small. I wish they had some little cakes or something. The Asian food section is the one that needs the most  work right now. It was the weakest section and needs more variety. I'm guessing their chef has very little experience with Asian cuisine  since even the simple dishes were messed up. The Korean short ribs, for example, were overcooked and drowning in sauce. The dim sum needs to  be made in smaller batches.Minor quibbles aside, this is a very good buffet. Maybe not as big or as fancy as others, but very good for what  it is and the price makes it an awesome value.

Wicked Spoon takes first place on my list for best Vegas Buffet!!I was there for lunch today and it was a delight! Just walking into the new Cosmopolitan is an amazing experience.Once you make your way to the second floor for the buffet, you are encountered with splashes of modern art, including oversized sculptures of high heels; very sexy! The whole vibe is very trendy, hip and modern. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We were seated in our special req. booth without a problem.  We headed to the buffet and I couldn't believe the humungous selection of items! I read about the tiny dish distribution, so I knew what to expect, but I didn't think there would be such a variety. I have been to practically every buffet in Vegas, and usually make my way around the whole thing on the 1st round, but I only got through half of this place the first time around!Almost every item I tried was highly delectable! One of my favs was the braised beef with pasta & mushrooms, yummmmy! The roast chicken and mashed potatoes were also divine, perfectly cooked and seasoned! Even the salad was above the norm, with tasty, high quality, applewood smoked bacon.It seemed like every dish was made of the finest quality of ingredients. This was a major bargain, 20 bucks for a gourmet lunch with endless, delicious selections! The only negatives were the mac & cheese, which lacked seasoning & the santa fe style corn bread bake, not my thing, food labels would have been helpful here.The desserts were beyond amazing as well, the salty peanut & pistachio ice cream tasted like they were homemade, and those madelines were mighty tasty. I highly recommend this buffet!! As a gal who is known as "The Queen of the Buffets", I give this one 5 stars!!!!

I came here during the week of Christmas last year, which was the opening week of The Cosmopolitan. For such an upscale and luxurious casino, you would think that their restaurants have to be top-notch and at their best. Unfortunately, that was not the case when I went.The Good: $20 for lunch at a very nice place is not that bad. There was a variety of food, most of which were served in individual plates, which is different compared to most other buffets in Vegas that serve their food in big trays for you to scoop out of. There was a good selection of meats ( definitely try the lamb if you can), a small sushi bar, some dim sum, and other kinds of food -- they all varied in excellence. There are  unusual foods which I have not seen at other buffets before, one of them being pork belly fat wrapped inside a flour bun. Nonetheless, the  food was presented beautifully, just like the decor around the buffet (curly-glass chandeliers and beautiful silverware). The dessert selection  was amazing, and it's not like any other dessert selection you see at other buffets. There were macaroons, chocolate slates, mini chocolate- covered apples (each is unique with different toppings), gelato, unusual tarts sitting in egg shells, and chocolate covered strawberries. You can tell that they put a lot of effort into individually making each piece of dessert.The Bad: My number one complaint here would be the  staff. Although friendly as they were, they were not prepared as they should be, both in terms of handling food AND as waiters. Our waiter  approached our table saying, "My name is uh, ____. *Long pause* I am going to be your server today." It seemed pretty obvious he was trying  to remember his lines, which should have been perfected before the grand opening of such a high-class casino. Not only that, but he  DISAPPEARED after giving us our drinks and NEVER CAME BACK to check up on us or refill our drinks. Our glasses were empty after a while and we had to call on a random staff to refill it for us. As we were eating, we heard a big clash near the kitchen door and found that the same  staff member just dropped the tray with our drinks on it. Another clash was heard later on, for another staff had dropped another tray on the  floor. Our finished plates literally filled up the entire table before the staff took it away. Also, the place lacked fruits, which I think  is essential at a buffet.Overall: I feel that this buffet has so much potential, but just lacks the proper staffing experience and some food  quality/selection at the moment. If you're reading this review in the future, hopefully the staff will be more prepared and the food choices will open up just a little by then. I am a little bit curious myself to see much they will improve in a few months' time.

Great value - it's a reasonably priced buffet.  Great service and nice ambience.  For the first time I didn't feel like I had to fight with other people to grab the best food.  As others have said - the presentation is great with individual sized portions of most of the entrees. The downside is some of the food was just warm - I could just tell it would be so much better if it were piping hot, fresh from the oven.  Flavors were good, though. Dessert was amazing, fudge pyramids, gelato, mini apple cobblers.  If you're coming from the casino, be prepared to walk a long way to get to the buffet - it's far!

Interesting concept. For 27 bucks for dinner, one of the cheaper gourmet buffet options on the Strip. Wicked Spoon's concept is a buffet tapas thing - everything in small portions on small plates. Unfortunately, there are several problems: one, the stations aren't very clearly labeled. So you have to wander around a bit to figure out the layout and there are a couple of stations I didn't really get. (I THINK it's a make-your-own-Thai-rice-noodle-soup station at the end of the Asian portion.)The second problem is that any time you plate several small plates on top of a larger one, they start to slide around as you walk. And it made for stacking the dirty dishes difficult for the waitstaff. Who, coincidentally, are not super amazing at their jobs. I can't IMAGINE what the dishwashing looks like behind the scenes.Overall, there was a wide range of food options. I enjoyed an udon noodle stirfry, some Korean riblets, and the little shrimp cocktails. Lamb chops in olives and artichoke hearts was a stand out, if they could get some more olive flavor into the meat. We also uniformly enjoyed the sausage in balsamic grilled grapes. (Okay, not exactly sure what this was, wish I'd taken better notes. Sorry Yelp.)I see that other Yelpers have given the Asian section bad reviews but I honestly thought it was one of the better Asian sections on a buffet in town. Less focus on sushi, and more on regional foods that don't always show up on a buffet line. (Probably because middle America is just getting around to trying it.)We didn't like the already-lumped crab. It was chewy and overdone and we all commented that we preferred the mess of shelling it because it usually tasted better. Other misses: lamb ragu with gnocchi. Saffron cod barely tasted saffrony. Dessert was eh, but we didn't have any of the gelato. I did like that they had a bowl  of mixed berries - should have stuck to this, a bit of fresh cheese and bread off the salad line and gone with a European dessert. The cheese selection is quite nice for a buffet in this price range.I hate to feel so mixed. I'm sure management will dumb this place down soon, so go  experience it for yourself before they do.

The Best Buffet in LV!We tried practically all "high end" and highly rated buffets in LV, including Sterling, Wynn, Belagio, Studio B, Paris, Rio, PH, Caesar, ect...  We actually got sick of buffets at the end.However, we thoroughly enjoyed WS the most even though it was the last buffet we tried.  The food was flesh and higher quality than most.  There were more selections than most.  Wish we had gone here first so that we could have gone back before leaving LV.If you are not sure, just try their lunch buffet which is only $19/person.

We ate at the Wicked Spoon twice last week while in town for the CES. The gourmet food was so good that we went back a second time. We would have gone back for Breakfast had our schedule allowed it. Our first meal was on Wednesday at 1pm. The place was not crowded at all. There was a great selection of food. Everything was delicious. Others have spoken about the "individual serving" sizes being too small. Well you can take as many as you want or go back for more, so I don't see their argument. One point that I would make, however, is that if you just want to taste the ricotta cream spinach or the red wine braised mushrooms you HAVE to take a full serving. Our next meal was on Thursday at 7pm. Again it was not crowded. The selection was very similar to the previous lunch with a few added selections. The spicy crab meat was not overcooked but we did notice some small shell pieces in it.    The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Resort & Casino all the way back in the West End Tower. We easily walked from the Monte Carlo. Taking the crosswalk from City Center over Harmon Ave allows you to enter the resort by the chandelier. If you want to ride the tram, I would say it is just about the same distance from the tram station at the Bellagio as it is from the one at Crystals. The routes from both are convoluted.

Wicked Spoon is sooooo cute!!  This place feels so fancy-schmancy in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, but you aren't really paying all that much more for great food and beautiful presentation.  For Sunday Brunch, we came here with a party of 7 - It was $23 for Brunch and $30 for Brunch with unlimited Champagne.  I am sure that it is cheaper during the weekdays.  With all the drinking and eating that we've been doing, we decided that it was best to forgo the unlimited Champagne.  Having heard that this place just opened nearly a month ago, I was super impressed with their food and the number of patrons.  This place was not easy to find.  The drinks here are massive!  My cup of coffee was the same size as their huge orange juice cups!  Even though it is not unlimited, everyone still got a glass of Champagne as a part of their Sunday Brunch.  I love their portions of food.  I love that the desserts are serves in cute little metal cups - Excellent presentation and choice!  It is nice to know that the food has been untouched by someone else!  Bonus points!The dessert section was awesome!  I highly recommend their coffee Gelato Ice cream (There are bits of nuts and toffee in there! MmMm), Strawberry dipped Chocolate (There are toffee in the chocolate and rice crispy covered in white chocolate! mMmMm), and the list can go on and on.  I actually don't recommend their caramel/chocolate dipped mini red apples, but that may be a personal bias as I believe in green apples and white chocolate!  Did I mention that they had fresh Dragon Fruit? MmMm!Beautiful experience here.  I definitely want to return for their dinner buffet the next time I am in Vegas!  Since this place is still new, I am sure there will be more changes and improvements in the menu!  I can't wait for it!!!

I love the new Cosmo hotel in Vegas, my friends and I already planned to stay there next time we come back. The whole place was full of young, attractive people, which is A+ in my book. Wicked Spoon is one of the best buffet places I've tried in Vegas...for the price. It offers bite size portion, which is great because we can almost try "everything" in there. The food is not too amazing, in fact, a little too salty for my taste. But boy, their chefs know how to make lamp....every single lamb dish I tried...LOVE IT! Their worst dish? No doubt the Korean bbq short rib, too sweet and too salty.Our server was super cute and nice too. I believe her name was Laura or something like that. She was making jokes with us and we even hang out after she got off work. I like the Cosmopolitan, I like Wicked Spoon and I like you Laura :)

My buddy Tony T, which is a chef, recommended this place, which is in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino.  The Cosmopolitan is a beautiful hotel, there was nothing wrong with the hotel, Except the BUFFET!  They make it upscale, but it's not all that.  There's no flavor at all.  You have tourists, which have lost all there $$ on Gambling.  They feel they should recuperate there losses with eating all the food they can.  They make the portions very small, in little plates (tapas style), but you can only fill 4 items on your plate.  That's a lot of dishes to work with.Well, since I lost so much $, i wanted to eat so I can have some energy to play again.  1.  SERVICE: Our waiter was not to be seen.  We had to flag down a Manager after 20 mins of dehydration,  once we spoke with the manager, we had prompt response with our drinks, with 2 other waiters.  We still didn't see our waiter for another 30 mins.  Once we did, we actually had to ask for sugar because there was none available for our Ice Coffee and Ice Tea.2.  PHO STATION: The Soup was not hot and they place the Greens under a food hot lamp.  All the greens were wilted.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??3.  LABELS:  Most of the dishes have no labels.  You pretty much have to guess what the dish is.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  I thought this salad was with taro, but it wasn't.  I had no idea what that stuff was?  Even their soups, you had to guess.  There were 2 choices of soup, Pho Base or Miso Soup.  of course, they don't label it.  I betcha most of the "WHITE" people put the miso soup with the Pho Rice noodles.  that's a major faux-pau in the culinary industry.  Just my opinion.4.  DESERT BAR:  Again, they have no labels next to the items, so you have to guess what the heck it is.  You had to flag down someone behind the bar in order for them to hand you a desert behind the display case.  They should leave that out, if you have to wait there for 5 mins to get a desert.They had this Egg custard , in an Egg shell, that Tone recommended, which had different layers of flavors.  I was so intrigued.  So I got one.  But to my dismay, it was just soup.  It was a creamy shot of Blah.. he said it was not made right, since the first time it was made.  it was suppose to be layers, but they did not let the layers set.5.  RESTROOMS:  They have a very very small restroom for the Buffet.  only 4 people can fit in the bathroom at 1 time.  When I was there, only 1 urinal was available.  so a max of 3 people can be in at one time.  This is okay, but after i finished my meal, the Desert Egg Shell Custard shot did not agree with me.  At least I can recommend the Egg custard as a Laxative.

THIS PLACE WAS GREAT!! I went during the holiday season this past winter, but since they were doing this 7-hotel buffet deal for super cheap, a lot of the usual buffets that I frequent (Rio, Paris) were packed.  So, fearing that I might run into yet another long and dreadful buffet queue, my bf and I got there around 4:45, which turned out to be a little too early since the buffet actually does not open until 5pm.  So after a 30-minute wait, mostly just getting all the early people in, we were in for a great surprise!I absolutely LOVE how they make their dishes into these cute little tapa-sized containers.  It makes the place so much neater!!! And the dessert... ooh my gosh.  I almost died on the table from dessert-overdose.  They have these delicious chocolate and raspberry (or strawberry.. not sure) truffles that had me going back to the dessert section again and again.  Oh, did I mention our waiter, and most of the other waiters, was pretty damn model-status? :PFor 27 bucks, this dinner buffet was very, very worth it!

An awesome buffet...I came here when it was only 2 weeks old.  The line was only about 10 minutes long and lunch was 25 bucks.  The style was tapas so the food isn't mass produced.  They had their meat cuts, breakfast items like eggs benedicts, cheesy potatoes, some smoked salmon, braised pork belly, dim sum items, etc.  Definitely quality buffet food.  Also, the cutest desserts evar, and 10 different gelato flavors... !! Only complaint, our server was super bad... didn't come up to get our drink orders til my second plate... rarely came by at all to get refills or ask us if we needed anything...

2I was at CES and got tired from walking the show.  I was hungry and didn't want to eat the crappy Sbarro pizza, nathan's hot dogs, etc.  I also wanted to check out the new Cosmopolitan hotel so I took the shuttle from the convention center to the Cosmopolitan.I was happy to see the buffet.  Lunch was only $19.The decor is very clean.  The food is laid on fairly well.  There is a sushi/sashimi section (with other Asian food such as pho, dim sum, etc.).  There are lots of small pots with beef, chicken, port, etc.  There is a carving station for turkey, prime rib, ham, etc.  The salad bar is also very nice.  Overall, the selection, cleanliness, and quality of food was top notch.I knocked off 1 star because the dim sum area was under a heat lamp that severely dried out the food.  It's really annoying trying to eat shrimp har gow with a paper dry skin.The dessert was AWESOME!  The gelato station was great and i especially loved it because they have sorbetto.The chocolate is the good stuff and top quality.This is a great addition to the Las Vegas buffets and is my new favorite.

This is hands down the best buffet in Vegas already. As everyone else has said, the food is almost all on small plates so it's hot and fresh. More than that, though, is that for $27 at dinner you really get legit upscale food. Two different types of crab. Shortrib over risotto. Full carving station with lamb. Lobster ravioli. Pan-seared trout. And there's no wait because it's a little hidden in the new Cosmo. Bonus: Huge glass of wine was only $10.

I went into Cosmo hotel to grab an early dinner after CES and was blown away by the decor and ambiance of Wicked Spoon Buffet. We got there at right at 5pm with no wait, and the cost was only $27 for dinner. Affordable pricing for such an upscale looking buffet.I loved how all the food was laid out and there were individual platings of all the sides in cute mini plates or pots. Definitely an A+ for looks. Too bad the taste fell way short.At first, I though that it was pretty tasty, but alas I was just too damn starving and distracted by the pretty plates to notice. But after my first plate, I noticed that nothing really stood out. I had no favorites to go back to...and I just ended up trying a little bit of everything. Which is almost IMPOSSIBLE to do.Remember those cute individual platings? TERRIBLE IDEA! Sometimes I would only want a bite or two, but because I had to take the entire serving, I ended up with a stack of lil plates and pots on my table. I felt super wasteful, but couldn't bear to eat the entire serving because I didn't like it all that much. Plus those small serving plates avoid you from piling on  different things at the buffet creating more than necessary trips back and forth. By then, you just end up getting full before you can get  your money's worth. Boo!The meats were a little dry, and WHAT...no crab legs?? Instead they had some kinda peeled crab (I THINK) in some  butter sauce. Of course I wouldn't really know because nothing is LABELED. But regardless, it was rubbery and weird and tasteless. My  favorite thing was the shrimp cocktail, juicy and plump...but it was served in tiny plates of 2 shrimp apiece :\ Whyyyyyyyyy is life so  difficult??My favorite part of buffets is always the dessert bar. Again, everything here looks stunning. Miniature works of art. Although  looking individual and unique, many of their dessert were similar in form...custard base with a fruit gel. Nothing spectacular. They also  have chocolate covered strawberries which I liked, but my favorite was the gelato. The salted peanut flavor was my top pick.Service was also  on the slow side. It took the waiter 30 minutes before my coffee came out. By then I already fell asleep from the mediocre food -_-Pretty face, but lacking in quality substance.

4I ate here after I went to CES and let me just say this place is nice! If you are a guy who likes to be served by girls this is a place for you because all of servers are waitresses. The Restaurant itself deserves 4 STARS.It was very clean and organized. There seats are new and the booths are comfortable. The tables are good size and there are enough space to walk between tables. The style is modern which was a big plus!The service deserves 5 STARS.All the waitresses smiled and very polite. They know when you need a refill of the WATER BOTTLE.. yes they give each table a bottle of water so you could pour some on your own glass. No waiting for service even in the food area they served with smile.The food deserves a 4 STARS.They serve  a high quality of food and very delicious. The servings were decent amount but you could always go back if you want more. They have sushi and I really like their Shirm Tempura Sushi. Their mushroom cooked in red wine was so good! I've never had anything that was cooked in red wine but it was sooo delicious. Their fried rice was not greesy at all but so good. Most of their food weren't greesy. The deserts are the best! so many choices to choose from. Gelado ice cream, cookies, rice cakes, and so much more!The price is reasonable SUNDAY BRUNCH $23 deserves 4 STARS.DEFINITELY GOING BACK TO TRY DINNER!

4Great Vegas buffet!!Pretty affordable for quality tasting food! Sunday brunch was $23 dollars. The selection was good, and they had just enough variety without being too overwhelming. The dessert bar display was beautiful, anddd they had gelato! Except no hazelnut flavor = -1 points  for them, but still, lots of sweets to choose from :) The interior of the buffet was pretty cool. I don't know how to describe the design  inside since it was kind of different/unique, and also kind of random, but it was pretty fancy for such an affordable buffet. This buffet  was not outstandingly exceptional, however, as in don't expect to find fancy or exotic cuisine here. But you will find all of your main  dishes prepared quite well. One of my favorite dishes was the orrechiette pasta, it was absolutely amazing! I'd say this buffet falls in  line with the Bellagio buffet. Definitely worth a try!

This is one of the best buffets on the Strip.  We came here for the Sunday brunch, because I'm a brunch glutton.  Since it was fairly new, the place is still really clean and sleek.  We got to the line a tad before noon and it was still really short.  We walked around to get a scope of the place.  There was an area with Asian foods, carving station, and breakfast area, and two islands on either side of the buffet for the salad and cheese bar, and the dessert bar.  I love how many of the dishes are served in small dishes.  The shrimp cocktails was in a dish with on 2 shrimps, but they were really good, too bad there were no crab legs.  Also, the prime rib was delish!  It was really juicy and there were different kinds of condiments to choose from, I chose the chimichurri.  I also loved that there were chocolate dipped strawberries and gelato in the dessert area.  My only disappointment was that our server wasn't really timely with taking away our plates.  Other than that, this is a definitely a buffet worth your money.

I'd say it was ok.  Yes, I can see how they're trying to be different from the other buffet by offering their dishes in smaller portions and yes, i'll give it to them...the presentation of their dishes are amazing (especially in the dessert section!), but...i just wasn't blown away.  =/The pros: The salads are amazing...the miso shrimp salad...i had to have seconds!! It was delicious!! Husband doesn't eat much salad...but  came back with a plate full of different salads. The asian section of the buffet had some pretty good entrees.  And the dessert selection was  pretty vast.  The chocolate covered strawberries, the fudge, cookies, and of course, there was a gelato bar that a buffet can't be without.  The cons:  Some of the dishes had no placards so you didn't really know what it was that you were getting.  The fish dishes were overcooked.  The ham hock mac n cheese...the mac was completely undercooked, it tasted like raw dough! It was disgusting! Bottom line: Maybe they need  more time.. i would go back again to give it a second chance!

Wicked Idea!Bomb buffet with a twist; items are placed in cute lil pots and kettles! Great for sharing!Another pat on the back for wicked...they have a unique menu!  A lovely array of gourmet oohs and aaahs that will leave you highly impressed.Few things I tried: chicken pot pie, braised short ribs with sweet berry glaze, mushu taco, spinach risotto, mac n cheese with toasted crumbs, some cod dish, clams, mushroom ravioli, sushi etc.  They all came in these adorable little pots and serving dishes =)  Everything was extremely rich and flavorful!Dessert looked a lot better than it tasted but again, I was impressed. Gold flakes sprinkled on top, the dessert bar looked like Willy Wonka's factory! Choc covered strawberries and mini candy apples were a hit.I went for lunch and it came out to $22!  VERY IMPRESSED =)

I think this buffet and I are going to have one of those love/hate relationships. On one hand, the food was pretty good. Definitely on par with the food at the M buffet. Plus, I didn't have to waste my time getting messy trying to get the crab out of the shell, because it was already done for me. Something, I haven' found at any other buffet.  Also, unlike the M, the wait to get in isn't 3 to 4 hours.They also offer a lot of desserts that other buffets don't. Chocolate covered strawberries. Chocolate covered apples [but I wish they were caramel covered]. Crepes. Peanut butter & jelly gelato. Salted peanut gelato. Cute litle mini chocolate cones filled with pudding.  On the other hand, the thing I hate most about this place [seems to be the  thing most people love about this place], is the fact that most dishes are served on individual plates or little pots. In most buffets, only the desserts such as cake or pie are served on individual platters. Why do I hate this? Simply put - I can't fit as much on my plate. When I go to buffets - my plan of action is to usually get a little bit of a lot of food to kind of feel the place out. Which is, definitely something I couldn't do here. You can only grab about 3 small plates at a time. Which means you have to get up from your table more often. I guess, this could be construed as a good thing - as it provides a little more exercise to negate some of the thousands of calories you will have consumed by the end of the meal. BUT, I like to chill at the table with whomever else I am with and enjoy my food - without having to pause the conversation to get up and get more food every five minutes. Lastly, I've gotten used to the free, unlimited beer/wine/cider offered at the M. So, I was disappointed by the fact that this buffet did not offer the same. But, that could just be me being spoiled. =pSo, like I said - definitely a love/hate relationship. But, I think it's leaning more towards the hate side. Would I go back? Probably. Would I rather go to the M? Probably.

At least one buffet visit is a requirement of mine each time I hit Vegas. The line at the buffet in Aria was to long, and so I yelped nearby places and found this place in the Cosmo which is next door. Pass the Red and Black heel, take some photos,  and  bam you're there.  It was a pretty good find. 19$ for lunch and not that long of a wait. Most dishes are served tapa style, in small little plates or small pans. I like this concept becauseA) it doesnt allow you to put to much on your plate in one sitting and B) all the food doesnt touch each other.  Dont kid yourself though, you will end up overeating as the food is really good  and made with quality ingredients. Their gelato was probably the best Ive had at a buffet.  Only pet peeve I had was they dont label half of their dishes, so you dont know what your getting and you have to end up asking them which is a pain when your hungry.

overall a tasty buffet.  definitely try the roasted rack of lamb, it was very tender but BEWARE THE HORSERADISH SAUCE - it's from the 7th pit of hell.  a little dab will do you just fine.  I foolishly swirled a bite around the sauce, put it in my mouth, and after 5 or 6 chews, dropped the fork and started slapping my forehead.  it was like eating an entire ball of wasabi.everything else was average to above average, the  sushi rolls were surprisingly decent, and the desert table, the wicked spoon's key selling point, was a beautiful sight to behold, and while  it was enjoyable, it gave a bit too high an expectation.  I will say the chocolate covered strawberries were AMAZING and the strawberry  cheesecake shot was also very good. the ambiance is nice and the service was great.  so yeah, 4 stars.  dunno if I'd go back unless one of my  friends had a big sweet tooth.

Came in on a weekday. Bad idea. The food was kind of dry. I even saw the cooks moving the food around to keep the sauces from settling. Friend came for a second time on the weekend and reported to me that the food was a lot better and fresher, but there was a wait on the weekends. The food looked better than it tasted, for the most part. Overall, for the price you pay, which was about $29 or so after taxes, it's still a pretty good buy. The only thing I found annoying was that many of the selections were already in their own dishes. So if you wanted to grab a lot of food at once, it was sort of impossible unless you were good at Tetris and knew how to stack like a boss.

Excerpted from a longer post about my experience at their Grand Opening Weekend. To read the full thing and see the pictures, check out my blog!The next morning we somehow managed to wake up with enough time to make it to brunch at the Wicked Spoon. And boy am I glad we didn't miss this. You want to talk about epic? This was the most epic brunch ever. Not only was it the most innovative buffet I've ever seen, but all of the food choices were fresh, constantly replenished and often served to you by a worker from behind the counter. I ate the most amazing truffled potatoes ever and was super bowled over by the Eggs Benedict, fresh berries and butternut squash ravioli. They had a giant dessert station as well complete with a full gelato bar. Everything was so pretty and we found a resurgence of the gold flakes on numerous desserts.

Food is presented in a very cute fashion and taste fresh and delicious.  The dessert station is better than Bellagio and now I must say that it is the best buffet in Vegas.  One thing I have to mention is that the line wasn't very long but it went very slow.  When you get in, there's all these empty tables.  I think they should get it together and hire more servers so that people don't have to wait that long.  I think waitingin line is the biggest drawback of going to buffets.Last thing, they will ask you "would you like to put in gratuity?" I say yes and pay 15%, then they give me a slip with gratuity section being empty.  So I wrote it in.(they already put it in)  I paid twice of gratuity because their system is confusing.  Don't make my mistake.

I had the breakfast buffet for $16.00 on a Sunday in January.  The place wasn't busy at 9am.  Nice design and looked very modern. The staff was nice and attentive, especially my waiter.  Standard breakfast-omeletts eggs benedict, french toast, apple sausages, fruits, cereal, dragon  fruit, smoothies at the dessert table.  No seafood or any other ethnic food.    The portions are small like tapas style as mentioned in other  reviews.   Cons: I wish they posted  the prices at the cashier or a sign near by.  Also, I wish there were signs for all the items instead I  noticed a few signs on some items.

4Went during a weekday and the food was mediocre. The two stars are only due to its presentation, which was excellent. Our waitress was one of the best - took care of us, explained the divisions of buffet areas, and she took the initiative to bring us water WITH our regular drinks. Our table was never cluttered with plates because as soon as we left and came back, they were gone. The food came preportioned already, which is a great idea to limit waste at a buffet and the shrimp was already peeled and placed in a small plate for us with a dollop of cocktail sauce. So cute!The lack of three stars is due to the actual food :(Unfortunately the food was not good. It was bland and dry. The desserts weren't even  that great except for the ice cream/gelato. The pasta, though it was preportioned, was left out in little bits only to dry because of the heat  lamps :( Most of the food tasted burnt and overcooked.The cosmo was definitely a place to visit and sight see but not to eat.

We spoke to our friends and they had gone for brunch and thought it was good...maybe because I went during a weeknight.  Anyways, here is what I thought about this buffet.The prosdécor-very cool looking chandelierservice-goodfood & dessert-looks very upscale and deliciousfresh berries-blueberries, raspberries, blackberriesThe Consfood & dessert-doesn't taste like how it looksWhat's going on...why doesn't anything taste right???The only thing that tasted good was the braised pork bun.  Everything else was a miss.  I tried the shrimp cocktail and after one bite, I spitted it out because it tasted like toothpaste..yuck.  I honestly don't feel like I am getting what I paid for...sure they have all the upscale selection, but what good is it when it doesn't taste like how it should?  Not good at all.  I tried a bit of many items, but maybe it's a weekday so the food aint so great????  Regardless, I won't be coming back during a weekday.  Definitely more money spent for the quality of  food eaten.  We walked out of there disappointed with a tummy full of blah.Maybe I try brunch sometime in the distant future...

Why must I "rate" this place, damn it. The idea is so original, new, trendy, and seemingly THE dream buffet of a gourmand. Unfortunately, I guess the common phrase is true, "looks aren't everything."Wicked Spoon is located in the Cosmopolitan hotel. It's a long, weird and windy walk. You will be easily distracted by odd objects: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=q-Ckm0qluUvbReCUhCWYrwThe buffet has different selections of dishes served in buffet style trays and some items were presented in mini pots, pans, and your own mini deep-fryer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=g0AI7zRDTe5M-Oac7z4wbQ).  The dishes were labeled with detailed descriptions; instead of your typical "arugula salad" sign, it was "arugula and candied cashews with blackberry vinaigrette salad." It kinda gives you a clear idea of what you're eating, sans playing the guessing game.Although the dishes were attractive, I've had better buffets on the strip. I can think of maybe 1 or 2 memorable dishes, and the rest were just passable. Hm, I guess that's what you would generally expect at a buffet..I was a little disappointed in the dessert section. The colors and presentation of the desserts selection made me so excited. Come on, dessert cups topped with edible silver flakes?! Unfortunately, the only thing I really enjoyed were the mini apple pops and gelato. Everything, all in all, was sort of a hit or miss. (a "miss," as in, hell to the NO)This place has so much potential! I have mixed feelings about this buffet, so I don't know how to accurately rate it. So, why is this so hard? Well, that's what she said.

After having a bad experience at the paris buffet, we decide to go walk off all the unnecessary calories off by going to the new Cosmopolitan hotel and see all the shiny bling and art. It was indeed impressive. After a brisk walk through long open hallways and a cluster of 5 foot tall dog statues pointed towards each other, then a giant high heel we came across the Wicked Spoon buffet. Even though were we were full we wanted to do  walk through. We were impressed by the tapas style method of serving and the food looked good as well. Then we passed by the dessert section which is FULL of fudge, pastries,  chocolate covered crab apples and strawberries, ice cream and gelato, and fresh berries ( you can tell i have a major sweet tooth) that was the point we realized we made a huge mistake by eating at the paris and were planning a return trip there to actually try the food that was making our mouths water.Fast forward 2 days, we arrived there at 5pm for sunday brunch which was reasonably priced at $27.Ambiance was very comfortable and the decor was cool. luckily we were seated next to the food since we made many trips back n forth seeing how you can only fit 3 small (2-4 bite) plates onto the normal plate you carry. Ii tried 3 different salads which were all fresh and yummy.Truffle oil infused potatoes were nothing to write about. they love lamb at this buffet because there were 3 different dishes there, not a huge fan of lamb but they were ok as well.I didnt expect much from buffet sushi but it was actually surprisingly good since it was being prepared fresh constantly by the chef on site. There was a Pho station which was nice too, you don't usually see these at buffets. I also liked the brussels sprouts, and fingerling potatoes, red wine mushrooms and the pork bun.Kinda dissapointed that you have to pay $15 extra for king crab legs, i opted out since i wanted to focus on the regular menu items there.they did serve 2 kinds of king crab, (not legs) one in a butter sauce and the other in a bernaise sauce. both were overcooked and rubbery.I even tried the new batches they brought out to find the same result :(I didnt try the meat carving stations.Dessert did not dissapoint though, berries cherries all juicy and sweet.Huge tasty chocolate strawberries, great Gelato, i tries the pistachio and salty peanut flavors.I'd go back for sure.Currently the M is my favorite buffet but this may take that spot.BTW if youve got $90 to spend per person check out the sterling buffet at the Ballys! only open 1 day a week but its the Ultimate. top notch shit there

I like the concept.....buffet style small dish servings. This is the newest buffet at the Cosmo hotel. It is a pretty decent offering and the twist is that some of the food options are already portioned in small serving dishes which you can pick up. Keeps the food wastage down and I think it improves the buffet experience by limiting inevitable self-serving errors (avoid getting a plateful of warm smoked salmon). Pastas were amazing and a cutting station with medium rare steak. Great desserts especially the gelato. Fresh, clean with waitstaff that aren't gruffing and huffing from the buffet grind. One of your better buffet options on the strip right now

Came here with the fabulous Jessica Y. (see review below).First off..I totally understood why there was no wait on a Saturday night. This place is located in a really random section of the hotel. Maybe people got lost trying to find the buffet?Dinner was $27.99 which is a little cheaper than say Bellagio or the Wynn.The first thing I noticed was the swanky interior. It matches the hotel in that everything is very modern.I knocked off a star for the food selection. I really thought there was not enough options. I usually go to the Bellagio or Wynn buffet and I usually come back with a FULL plate every time. At the Wicked Spoon...I kept staring at everything and just thought....meh.They give you little pots/pans instead of letting you scoop things until you realize you have 3 little pots/pans on your plate and no room for anything else. Those suckers take up space and they slide around your plate.I knocked off another star cause the food I got...I didn't like.I like my buffets with a mix of familiar and gourmet...but this place tried to be all fancy schmancy and failed at making the food taste good. The pizzas particularly looked really flat and unappetizing.I knocked off another star for their desserts. I am a girl and desserts mean everything to me when it comes to meals. No matter how full I am I will always have a FULL plate of desserts. All the stuff they had though was just so....safe and boring and repetitive. Chocolate covered strawberry or apple. Ice cream. A few cakes. How boring. How lame.In all my years coming to Vegas I ate the least here. I couldn't find anything and the dessert area made me sad.

I had to try it.  We were tired of the M (except I really like their cider, and when they serve it to me in a wine glass) so we wanted my brother to be the first in the family to try the Cosmo buffet (since my parents already hit up the M years before he could visit me again).We went on a Sunday night - line was nonexistent, price reasonable, ambiance great.  Our server Will was fantabulous - attentive, sense of humor, super fast on drink requests and refills.  He gave Eric R. three sprite refills at one time since he was unusually thirsty for soda, something he never drinks.  The iced tea was good - definitely brewed and not Lipton.  It was sort of oolong ish.  Will was the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one.Yes, the plates are awkward.  You can fit like 3 or 4 items at a time, they are clunky and sliding everywhere.  Will told us he can only clear one person's mess at a time, which slows down his progress.  The worst for me was the lack of signage.  Personally, I don't like to put a bunch of food in my mouth that has no distinguishing characteristics.  What the heck were in half the dishes?!  I honestly have no idea.  I wasn't in the mood for an omelette, so everything was out of my control.The shrimp and crab fingers - served in pairs already in sauce...yuk.  Almost every dish I could find, labeled or not, had pork in it, except carving station stuff.  Pasta, shrimp dishes, creamed corn, you name it, it was pork-infested.  With limited options, I didn't enjoy much except the make-your-own noodle bowl station at the end of the buffet.The desserts were worse - nothing was labeled except the gelato.  I didn't know what the hot pink goo was or the purple fudge looking stuff was, so I didn't get any of that.  I asked Will why the food wasn't labeled.  He said lots of people ask him that, that the management is aware, but that the "signage is delayed on order."  I would hope the Cosmo has its own printer.  Oh well.  Not coming back here.

The location of the Wicked Spoon is a bit off and away from everything (depending on your whereabouts of the hotel). The meats selection was decadent although I only tried their New York strip steak. The rotisserie looked delicious but I didn't want to have to deal with the possibility of a dry chicken, cuz I absolutely hate that. Salads and pasta selection was great. One curious thing was how many lamb dishes they had. Overall, potions were greatly sized, even the meats were cut to a good portion. The desserts were to die for: crunch-chocolate covered strawberries in both white and milk chocolate, macaroons (not so good), egg custard with pineapple sauce, and their gelato was very flavorful and melted in your mouth the way it should ;)I would come here again, but then again I'm not big on buffets.

Why would anyone give this place less than 4 stars when you have all you can eat Lobster?I love the portion sizes too, very good concept and instead of just grabbing food, everything is sized perfectlyfor $27, it's a bargain

First off, let me say that I went here for lunch on a weekday. December 28th, 2010 to be exact. It cost $19. The decor of the buffet is amazing. You almost feel like you're in a fancy shmanzy restaurant. What I also thought was pretty cool is that they serve most of the food in these  individual trays. So, you don't scoop it into your plate. Although this is cool, it definitely doesn't allow you to take a lot of food back to your table in one plate.So, why the 2 stars? Cuz the food was disappointing. It was mostly pastas. No roast beef or prime rib, or crab legs.  You would think one of these would at least be on the menu if you're paying $19. I just remember eating a lot of dim sum, some cheesy potato  dish, and some pasta dish that I can't remember.Maybe I'll try this place for dinner to see if it is better before writing this place off.

I actually had better expectations for this place since it is in an awesome new casino.1 star = for the individual servings; no need to scoop anything out2 stars = for the superb customer service of their waitress and waitresses that ensure you have everything you need.3 stars = for the little variety they had, the majority of everything I ate tasted good.It lacks the 4th and 5th star because there wasn't enough variety.  They have just about the right amount so I think the buffet is definitely worth trying.  They need to add a little flare to their menu though.  I'll come back in 6 months maybe; see if there is any changes.  Good thing is, there is not wait!  One thing they should add: a better seafood selection, like some crab legs, fresh raw oysters, and clams!

Dear Chef, please keep doing what you're doing now.  Don't succumb to the bad reviews...they are missing the point.This is, by far, the BEST Vegas buffet I have ever been to...THE BEST!For about $29 (tax included) you can eat at a pretty fancy restaurant -buffet style.  The food presentation was awesome.  The variety was unparalleled and unique.  This is some place I would love to take my parents to, and they don't like to eat at buffets very often because they feel gross in the end.  Seriously, where else can you get all-you-can-eat polenta, creamed corn, creamed spinach, potatoes with cheese and bacon, bone marrow, lamb, fresh berries, grapefruit & pomelo, those Chinese sticky rice tamale things, awesome deserts (my tiny key lime pie was lightly dusted with green limey powder, topped with some kind of red jelly and a gold flake) for under $30 in Vegas?  If you want volume and stereotypical food from everywhere around the world, this is not the place for you.  But if you want to feel human instead of like a pig at the end of your buffet experience, then this is the place to go.[VISIT - Jan 30 2011, dinner]

Loved this place! Definitely one of my Top 5 favorite buffets. It was a long walk to get to but I enjoyed the different types of artwork and took a lot of pictures so it wasn't boring. I personally loved the little pots and things that they served some of the food in. It was something different and I didn't mind making a few extra trips to load up my plate. My favorite selection was the mashed potatoes. The appearance wasn't anything special but I could taste the difference. Service was okay, not bad not great. The desserts weren't very appealing at first because I was really full but the chocolate covered strawberries were a plus. Kind of looked creepy because of the little crunchy dotty things that were on them and the apples but tasted great nonetheless.

I took my husband here as a part of his pre Birthday celebration.... I thought it would be cool. I felt bad because he couldn't really find anything to eat. He has really simple tastes and he said that this was too over the top for him. They had pizza which is one of his favorites but no pepperoni pizza just Chicken Parmesan. He tried to make a sandwich but they didn't have plain mustard just spicy. He tried the salads and he wasn't happy with that either. I was like "Go back up there and try to find something" While I'm stuffing my face with Kalbi. Yum...Kalbi good! They also had some pretty succulent lamb. I tasted the Crab in butter sauce but I didn't like it . They do make awesome Truffled Mashed Potatoes and the Brussell Sprouts with bacon were delicious. I don't know if it's the heavy sauces and creams that they use but you get full pretty quickly. I was disappointed about that and the fact that I could have taken my husband to the Palace Station Buffet and he would have been happier! The dessert was okay but some of it isn't edible it's just for looks. Like the Pink Cheeto looking things were just shaped sugar with no taste. I was only happy with the Chocolate Covered Strawberries. I know they want their food to look stylish but I think it should also taste good! I don't thinks it's impossible ...The Palms used to have these very cute mini pastries that looked cool and were very tasty! The food may make you feel bloated and tired. If you plan on eating here I would suggest just making this your meal of the day.

Ahh the Cosmopolitan you are over the top.. and so is your buffet.  The walk to the buffet is long and in a strange location.  It feels like walking 2 miles before you reach it.  However, this didn't stop me from going... TWICE.  On Thursday night for dinner we paid $27 it was good but some of the items were stale. The dim sum was atrocious and so was the crab.  Its nice to have the crab shelled for me but shieeeeeeet.  It was dry and rubbery. Sushi was alright too,  i liked how they had the sushi chef making the sushi right next to that station.  Thumbs up for having a mac and cheese station..  AMAZING!  I would say the best items were the pastas and salads.  The deserts were pretty, but tasted okay. The second visit to the buffet was a lot better.  We paid $23 on Saturday for brunch.  Ahhh breakfast foods.. So delish. To die for hash  browns, to die for chicken sausage, to die for Guinness pancakes.. yup i said that Guinness pancakes. YUMMMY! Everything on Saturday was fresh and tasty.  The selection was almost identical to dinner minus the breakfast items and lack of crab.Overall, I think this is one of the better buffets on the strip.  Although it sucks waiting in line. I would suggest going on a weekend.  More people= more food= food doesn't sit for  long periods of time.

This place is AMAZING!!!The food here is incredible! First of all, the hotel is pretty awesome...but I had heard more about the Wicked Spoon than I did about the hotel! For $27/person...this is the best deal in town!The individual portions are pretty awesome! It feels cleaner and nicer...I hate getting food after someone that likes to stir the entire tray to find that single piece of whatever they're looking for! Ugh! This is not a problem here!They have bone marrow! Seriously...awesome!!! Delicious...They have such an incredible variety of food...it was really hard to decide what to eat! Everything is presented very well...and MOST of the food was to my liking. I will say that the pork belly in the bun was a bit disappointing...it seems the pork belly wasn't cooked long enough to get that tender texture that you'd find at the good Chinese restaurants. The king crab meat was delicious...but the way it was prepared lacked some flavor.The desserts seem never ending! A fudge station...Really great! O...M...G...unlimited chocolate covered strawberries!!! Gelato galore! So many treats to eat...ohhh it was incredible!This is an outstanding buffet. However, solely based on food, this is a 4-star buffet. But...we had an incredible server...Josie! In fact, she is the best server I have ever had at ANY buffet! She was on top of it...refills were aplenty and usually before we even asked her (except this one time where she forgot my friend's Coke...and we definitely reminded her throughout the night about that one missed Coke!). Josie was  engaging...keeping a spirited and welcomed conversation with us! Josie's sense of humor is what makes the "Wicked" in the Wicked Spoon! Josie  truly made our Wicked Spoon experience a 5-star extravaganza! You can be sure that when I go back to the Wicked Spoon, I will specifically ask to be seated in Josie's section!!!So in summary:Savory Foods - 4 starsDesserts - 5 starsDecor - 4 starsService - A Zillion stars!

Most of the food is decent. We went on a random Wednesday night for dinner and I found the carving station to be just ok. The shrimp and snow crab cocktails were good, but where it really falls flat as a buffet is on the king crab. It's served shelled on a warmer in 2 types of sauce and when we went was dry, chewy, and a big disappointment as king crab was my main reason for going.They're on a good track, less creativity and better taste and they'd have 4 stars from me. I wouldn't even complain about the selection.

This is one of the better buffets in Las Vegas.  I went once for dinner, and twice for breakfast in early January 2011.  Dinner featured surprising items like pieces of dungeness and king crab already out of the shell and ready to eat.  Very good variety, and lots of Asian menu items.  The deserts including the gelato were exceptional. Service was very professional and courteous.  Drink refills can be a little slow because they bring you a whole new cup/glass instead of doing refills.  The same for requests for ketchup, hot sauce, etc.(they do not put the bottles on the table, choosing to pour small amounts in a small serving dish which takes longer for your server.  The buffet also features many items on small plates which makes for a cleaner, more sanitary buffet.I don't recall the exact prices, but they are cheaper thank Wynn, Aria, and Bellagio.  Less than $30 for dinner and less than $20 for breakfast brunch.

Ok first ofa ll i have to say that I've been and tried a whole lot of buffet in Vegas and by far this one is my favorite. Why you ask? Well I am not a big eater and actually hates the buffet concept of pilling up your food on the same plate. I also tend to lose interest when the buffet selection is way to much. It's like shopping shoes to me, yes it's nice to have a huge selection but if they are crappy why even bother right. Which brings me to my point why the concept of small individual plates is very appealing to me on a buffet such at The Wicked Spoon. They have delicious and tender meat, the chinese section is surprisingly good and not greasy, the bread selection was also yummy and not hard. and lastly the dessert maybe small in scale compare to the Wynn but was scrumptious and different. Did I mention the servers here are so attentive. oh and my tea was gourmet not some lipton grocery brand. All in all I would definitely come back here next time we go to Vegas.PS. i also love the decor and the bottled water they serve.

This place's idea about individual portions is pretty awesome. There is definitely more attention paid to the actual food than you would have in other buffets. Service was nice, although it became a bit of a "Where's Waldo" when we wanted to ask for some Sprite later on in the meal. New York Steak was really good for a buffet and I really enjoyed the miso shrimp salad. I want to come back to try for dinner, as we came during brunch!

So I went back for another round...specifically asked for Josie to be our server (of course!).There was definitely some changes to the buffet...the selections were somewhat different (what a nice surprise!). They didn't have the Lamb Osso Bucco (which I was sorely disappointed), but they certainly had other things to compensate for this loss...like crab claws! YUM!Josie was again fantastic...and I brought my parents and grandmother along this time! She was super attentive and made sure we always had everything we needed. Josie even impressed my father, who can be hard to please. LOL.We also met Alex, the manager for the Wicked Spoon...great guy and very friendly. He certainly has a great buffet to be proud of...and a great team of servers!Dining at the Wicked Spoon is probably one of the most enjoyable buffet experiences we've ever had...the food, the service, the ambiance are all simply fantastic!For the remainder of our trip, we were pretty disappointed at everywhere else we ate...and we compared every meal to our experience at the Wicked Spoon. Sadly, no other place was comparable.I'm looking forward to coming back to Vegas soon...just to eat at the Wicked Spoon! :-)

4 Past the giant shoes and the ring of dogs deep within the depths of the 2nd level of Cosmo, you'll find the Wicked Spoon.  I don't know what Deutsche Bank was thinking when they designed this place as everything seems to be so hidden, but it's definitely worth the adventure to get here.  Got a pretty good deal here since we came a bit before 11 so only paid the breakfast price of $17.99 and was able to get all the lunch stuff.  But I would of paid the lunch price since that's when the dessert section opens.  Holy shit, that's a nice spread and worth it.I like this buffet because although it lacks in variety, the quality of the food is amazing.  Alot of the food is already prepared in servings so you're not guessing how much to take.  But like most buffets, it's always great when they are new.  Let's see if they can keep it up.

really enjoyed this buffet, had the tapas style concept. staff was super friendly. i think they change up the menu frequently cuz they didn't have a lot of the foods mentioned in yelp reviews but had other ones on the night i went. my fav was the bone marrow, first time trying it and loved it!  also all the desserts looked great but all tasted like crap except the chocolate covered strawberries...those were yummy!
