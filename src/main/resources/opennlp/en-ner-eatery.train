"This was one of the best  <START:O_Experience> dining experiences <END>  I've had.  I've been going to try Twist for awhile and I went there last night for a special  <START:Food> meal <END> .  I got the 6 course  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> 's tasting  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I made a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  for 6 PM, the time they open. I was going to Blue Man Group later and I wanted to have plenty of time for a relaxed  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and time to get to the show.David took my order after answering some questions I had about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> --a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  I had poured over online.  He was a  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> help <END> .There were five  <START:F_FoodItem> canap <END> \u00e9s delivered shortly after.  They're  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  and they were  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> quite interesting <END>  in flavor and execution.  They were in/on three items.  My favorite was the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad of watermelon and dragon fruit <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> passion fruit <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> .  A close second was the  <START:F_FoodItem> paprika-tomato meringue <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked salmon <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> black olive agar <END> .  The almond and  <START:F_FoodItem> ginger sable <END>  was none too  <START:P_F_FI_Quality> shabby <END>  either.  All 5 were  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> excellent <END> !The first course was glazed Skate with  <START:F_FoodItem> red miso water <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> spring vegetables <END>  and Paris mushroom duxelle.The second course consisted of the 3  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  bites--a  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled prawn <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem>   spinach   velout <END> \u00e9 with  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END> .  The second bite was a piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> poached turnip <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> toasted sesame <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> bisque <END> .  The third  <START:Food> portion <END>  was a cold,  <START:F_FoodItem> soft-boiled egg <END>  with Ossetra caviar in the yolk on a bed of  <START:F_FoodItem> marinated clams <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> red ahi tuna <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> cuttlefish <END> .Course three was Mediterranean John Dory with  <START:F_FoodItem> pink   pepper   <END> , fine  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras tart <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> baby artichokes <END> .The fourth course was a  <START:F_FoodItem> palate cleanser <END> .  It was a champagne  <START:F_Dessert> sorbet <END>  which had some salted  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  and a Campari soaked Red Beet.  I was blown away by the  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> sorbet <END>  combination.  Fantastic!Course five was Sonoma Valley Duck Breast with Alexia Potato,  <START:F_FoodItem> berries <END>  on a  <START:F_FoodItem> piquillo   pepper   <END>  reduction, and Bigarrde sauce.  The duck was  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> excellent <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> tart fruit <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  reduction--another superb flavor pairing!The last course was  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  which consisted of 5 different  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .  They were a  <START:F_FoodItem>   coffee   panna cotta <END>  with Bailey's, Kahlua,  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  Gel\u00e9e and lime  <START:F_Dessert> sorbet <END> .  Almond-Frangipane cake with lemon-Krisch syrup.  A third was  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> raspberry <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> , and a \"Bella Vista\" granit\u00e9.  Then a  <START:P_F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> coconut tartlet <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> iced coconut <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem>   celery   curls <END> .  The last was a  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate ganache <END> .  As with the entire  <START:Food> meal <END> , the flavors developed in the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  was  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> wonderful <END> !  Coconut,  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> celery <END> --who would have thought? <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> excellent <END>  all evening, even when things became quite busy.  When my  <START:F_Drinks> iced   tea   <END>  got low, a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  brought me a new glass and switched the two.  I didn't have to ask, it was just done.  A funny example, when things weren't so busy, I sneezed.  Within a few moments, a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was at the table with a box of Kleenex.   <START:Service> service <END>  with a smile and funny!  The same  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  also brought me a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  Mandarin Oriental bag with a copy of all the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  items.  He had heard me mention to one of the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  that I'd never remember all the things.  The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  wanted to make sure I had something to remind me.  Classy!The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is very classy and the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  is  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> excellent <END> .  I was there during daylight and dined long enough to enjoy seeing the lights come on along the Boulevard!  I wore a jacket and tie--their website requests that men wear jackets.  Most came dressed with business casual.Truly a  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> wonderful <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END> , about 2 1/2 hours.  It's  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the cost for the chance to try some unique  <START:Food> foods <END>  in a unique setting with superb  <START:Service> service <END> !"


"The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is pretty good, but the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  is rather inflated (I guess it just goes hand-in-hand with the Vegas lifestyle).  The types of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  are unique, and the crust is of the thin floppy variety.  They also offer  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  bread (balls..blobs..?) that are decent.  There is limited  <START:A_Place> counter   space   <END>  to stand at, and even more limited stools on which to sit.  They also have some arcade  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END> , and the  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  of the mini alley are lined with countless photos which was pretty neat.My biggest woe is that it took forever to find!  The Cosmopolitan doesn't have any signs up for it, and it's hidden in this alley way to the right of an Asian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , near a non-functional glass elevator, 3rd floor.  Don't bother with Google Maps walking directions either, it takes you outside where you can smell the darned  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  baking but you can't see it!  Talk about a rough night..."

"I have eaten here over 10x. I used to go a lot on my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  break, but I have stopped. They had really good  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . The  <START:A_Environment> environment <END>  is nice, but the last 2x I went they messed up my order and I believe they made a mistake and put  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  on my  <START:F_FoodItem> french   fries   <END> ."

" <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  is very good!Started off with the calamari in umido! Well done. 2nd was the  <START:F_FoodItem> zuppa di cozze <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> vongole <END>  also very good. For the hibernate coarse  Pollo scarpariello is  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> excellent <END> ! Next my mother had the  <START:F_FoodItem> penne alla vodca <END>  also very good! So all in all a very nice dining experience! Cant wait to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork chop <END>  next time!",

"Bagels here are step up from Panera, Brueggers, einsteins, etc.  Try to get mail coupons from here.The  <START:A_Places> inside <END>  is very cramped, hot, and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  could be friendlier."

"I loved  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  and I can't believe it was just by accident that I discovered it. I was walking by on St Catherine's last night and saw a guy making crepes in a window. I thought to myself, this is a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  tomorrow and that's what I did today. For less than $11, I got a giant  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and a huge  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> egg crepe <END> . I arrived at 8am and there were hardly any customers. I was surprised and then concerned but not for long.  <START:Service> service <END>  was fast and polite, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  was perfect! I plan to come back tomorrow and try a  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  from their sweet  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> - <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> dark chocolate <END> . Mmm!"

"Just moved over to Ray/Priest and wanted to try Coal  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I went in a couple of weeks ago since I saw they had organic choices. I like the set-up, you can eat in fairly quickly or take out. I liked the selections they had and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  although they didn't have to do much since I took it home. I got an Organic Hamburger with  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were just regular  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , nothing fancy but delicious as all  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  pretty much are. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was tasty but was nothing really special which overall is what I would say about Coal  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was that it's just ok. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  for what I paid and very underwhelming. I don't think I'll be back, I love San Tan or other  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>  too much to come back here."

"The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was clean, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  just didnt have it.  I'm huge into \"sauces\" but each one I tried was too plain.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was dry and for what I got it seemed a little overpriced.I miss the greek  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ...PS.  I went back (very close to my office) and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was actually pretty good on the 2nd go-round."

"Just had a late  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  today.  <START:Food> food <END>  was very very good!  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were delish!  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  acted like it was her first day. Maybe it was? KNOW YOUR BEERS if you're a  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , study the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  or write it down and put it in your pocket! All in all we will go back for the  <START:Food> food <END> !"

"My daughter loves  <START:Restaurant> this place <END> .  They have a awesome  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  and friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . My daughter had her 4th birthday party here and its was a amazing time for her and all her friends. Their  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is a added ++."

"EAT THE ONION RINGS!!! They are amazing and only $2!!! The  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  here is decent, I have been here a few times and usually get the pulled pork  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , standard  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . I'd give the  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  6of10 but the  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and GIANT shark tank bring it up to an 8of10. I took a group of 25 last night and they handled a large group very well; we all ate and paid in a little over an hour. The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  Carl is extremely nice and accommodating."

"Sorry...Can only give  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  2 stars. We went at night, and the 1st thing we noticed was the cold, hard, white, & un-inviting  lights!!!! Ugh! ...Terrible lighting  <START:A_Environment> in there <END> ! It was like street light lighing, or like warehouse lighting....Was not appropriate for a dining  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  at all!  The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  informed us that they were out of 3 things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ! (...That's a bad sign right there!). I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> cole   slaw   <END> .The sauce & the  <START:F_FoodItem> shredded   chicken   <END>  came separate....You had to pour in the sauce on the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .  At Honey Bears, it already mixed in, which I feel is better that way.The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  wasn't really that warm, luke warm at most, and that goes for the sauce, too. Plus, I thought the sauce was on the bland side. It was missing flavor.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> cole   slaw   <END>  was the same way...bland.  Honey Bear's is far better!! ...Their sauce is kick-ass! ...It has a 'kick'.Also, the sound acoustics were awful  <START:A_Environment> in there <END> . There were only about  8 people dining but it sounded like there were 40 people! Also, I spotted an  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  eating  <START:Food> food <END>  in the kitchen.... I don't think that customer should be seeing that happening.One more thing, the  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END>  smelled absolutely HORRIBLE! ...Like a sewer  <START:A_Environment> in there <END> ! ...Sorry for all of the complaints, but I am just telling you what happened on my visit there... We will most likely not return here.  Honey Bear's  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  is way better!"

"We tried them with the a coupon I got in the mail. Buy one get one. Good  <START:Food> food <END> . I loved their  <START:F_FoodItem> banana muffins <END> .  <START:P_F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:P_F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> .  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was really nice."

"Oh my! We are visiting Madison for a family event and one evening my daughter returned home with a pulled pork  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  wrap which were delicious!It was a quick take out and an even faster devouring of some really  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ... Left us pining for more so now  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  is on my prowl list..."

"Panera Bread wannabes.  <START:Food> food <END>  was OK and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was Eh. Not large  <START:Food> portions <END>  for  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> . Free  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate chip cookie <END>  was a nice touch and the  <START:F_FoodItem> orange scone <END>  was good. Broccoli cheddar soup was pretty good. Would not come back."

"I'll keep it short. As with most things in Vegas, you get what you pay for. Try the  <START:F_Appetizer> shell   fish appetizer <END> - it has a high  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  tag for an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  but you won't have a better variety of  <START:P_F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:Food> seafood <END>  presented to you better than this. The  <START:F_FoodItem> wagyu beef skirt steak <END>  (like most American wagyu, this wasn't real wagyu, but an incredibly close offering) was incredible! The beef Wellington was good except the dough fell off the steak because the  <START:S_Cutlery> knives <END>  weren't serrated to cut clean through. They don't do serrated  <START:S_Cutlery> knives <END>  because they claim it tears the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Disagree with that but that's ok. Overall  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and you might get a chance to see a celebrity  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  at work."

"Incredible  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  and  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  happy hour!  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was super warm and friendly. Deviled eggs,  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbread <END>  were all  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END> . You can alway tell what kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  you are gonna get by the type of ice they use. A big block in my old fashioned set the stage for  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ! Will be back for sure."

"I've been to MRT multiple times.  The first to check out for a new potential  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spot and after approval, I brought a client there for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  again.  The  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  were  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  all times.  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  addition to Montford in my mind.  I'll keep going back."

"This group of  <START:Restaurants> restaurants <END>  rarely donate to local schools, charities etc, so I rarely visit it, but I visit when it is convenient to my friends.  This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  has pricey good  <START:Food> food <END> , but they always treat me strangely when I am there.  It's like if you are not a regular, you are disposable.  When I spend that kind of money, I don't want to be rushed by  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  b/c it is 10 p.m.   I also want the last piece or prosciutto on the board-- so stop trying to bus it every four minutes."


"I went here today for the first time - the  <START:Food> food <END>  was awesome.  Very  <START:P_F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and full of flavor.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  as well.  I will def be back soon.  ;-)"

"OMG I love  <START:Restaurant> this place <END> .  I go EVERY FRIDAY!  Call ahead and its almost always ready by the time I get there, usually within 10-15 minutes.  I go so much she now knows my name and my order.  Im shocked to see people say they are rude.  Never once have they been rude, even before I became a regular and Ive never seen them be rude to anyone while I am  <START:A_Environment> in there <END> .  I always get the combination plate  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Katsu and  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  Short Ribs and my bf gets combination plate  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Katsu.  Its quite a bit of  <START:Food> food <END>  for $9 and some change.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE  <START:Restaurant> this place <END> .  Its an old diner style  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but big, spacious and ok.  Its not a 5 star  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  but nice, esp compared to some of the ones I've been to around town.   <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> !"

" <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  spot looking out at camelback mountain.  They have an ever rotating selection of  <START:F_Drinks> craft beers <END>  and knowledgeable, friendly  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are very tasty.  We're bringing a friend back because we had a  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  time."

"Worst  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  rio I have ever been too. Completely Out of all their  <START:F_Drinks> juices <END>  and their  <START:F_Drinks> brewed   tea   <END> 's didn't have lids exposing the deliciousness of that which is  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  to all the environmental factors. Beans were slimy. Not a very pleasant working  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  either.  The cheery on top is the airconditoning unit was broken."

"Loved my Vegan  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  here - have never had something like that before.  It was two  <START:F_FoodItem> portabella mushrooms <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  etc.  <START:A_Places> inside <END> .  Also had sweet potato  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Everything was absolutely delicious.  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was exceptional. Would have given 5 stars except we sat at the entrance next to a busy, kind of run down mall.  If you are looking for  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  at reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  - without too much fuss - this is it."

"Just came across  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  on a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  search ap this morning and wanted to give it a try. I could easily end up becoming a regular here.We went for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , but they also have  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and have recently added  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Oh, and they do Take and Bake  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  on top of that! I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu scramble <END>  and my partner had the French toast. Both were amazing. We split a freshly baked  <START:F_FoodItem> vegan cinnamon roll <END>  with our  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . Unbelievably sweet and tasty.It was pretty quiet this morning so there was no waiting and plenty of time for the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  to share lots of info about The Cutting Board, the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , plans for the future etc..  The  <START:Food> food <END>  came out in a reasonable amount of time by a friendly  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  who was also able to explain some of the details of my scramble. I didn't recognize some of the micro greens on top so she clued me in.I was nosy with the table near us and those folks shared that the   <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  and the tofu tamari English muffin were also really good.Cleanliness matters to me and  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  was spotless.We noticed they had a few outside  <START:A_Furniture> tables <END>  and a water bowl for dogs. Thinking next time will bring the boys.Okay, my Take and Bake  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is almost ready. Hope it is as good as   <START:Food> breakfast <END>  was."


"Not surprised to see  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  is closed- a little relieved.They had a Groupon up, so they were clearly hurting for business. Shit-talking your existing customers generally doesn't encourage more people to give you a try, either: see management's response to Paul G's review. That alone dropped my typical 3-star-mediocre rating to a bottom of the barrel single-star. <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> , not too many specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and even when you order them they are  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> . Take out seems to be a hassle for this location but dining in would take a century and a half. <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  is not the freshest and  <START:W_Price> pricing <END>  is on par with  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  that have better quality. There are so many other  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in the city that do  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  better and with more variety, sans an attitude problem.Good riddance."

"On the fence with a mixed bag of deliberation.Let me first commend the  <START:S_Staff> hostesses <END> .  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  opener to the first-time visitor. Extremely friendly, courteous, and genuinely enthusiastic.We ordered the loaded  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  nachos, crispy (deep fried\")  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheddar   cheese grits   <END> , fried  <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> crackling pork shank <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END> .The best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . That  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> nacho boulder <END>  were a phenom start.... (that  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>  should be on every deathrow prisoner's bucket list)......... then it went sideways and slightly downhill like a 2-bit skateboard park. The  <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END>  was too salty,  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  too dry, and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese grits <END>  too...... out-of-a-cardboard-box tasting. The one saving grace was the pork shank because....... how the heck can anyone screw up pork at a  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> ?The  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> live band <END>  was very ordinary (seriously, how do you mess up \"My Sharona\"?), but the highlight throughout the night were the double barrel  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> dancers <END>  that kicked their heels throughout the night up in the rafters, as well as waddling and 2-stepping throughout the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ...... a very welcomed distraction.Because this is an SBE  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , on top of the fact that a Vegas  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is expected to be high at these  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  (yeah they're not cheap folks), my expectations are high, and therefore rating standards are tough on this one.  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  were decent, but ridonkulously high- <START:W_Price> priced <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  quantity, and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was slow. They also need to work on sound engineering and accoustic construction (waaaaay too much audible turbulence for a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ), and the air is far too thick. I think it has something to do with fog machines, but whatever it is, airflow is very stale and we eventually left because of headaches.That said, I won't take away from the general fun  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . The  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> dancers <END>  really brought a  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  dynamic to the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , and there was no shortage of gawking  <START:Food> diners <END> . It was sort of reminiscent of the days when the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders could send any  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  into a high-octane frenzy when they toured the country and were a one-of-a-kind breed back in the day.From a epicurean standpoint, skip  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  if you're expecting anything more than a basic  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  roadhouse joint. But if you're in the mood for group fun, you'll probably like it. Will I come back? For partying? Yes. For  <START:Food> food <END> ? Meh..... we'll see...."

"The name \"Hula\" makes me think of greasy Hawaiian  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  but I can promise you that you won't find any of that at this hopping Scottsdale eatery. My friend and I went for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and we were pleased that they had their own  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot (albeit  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> ) and we were surprised that the  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  was classy (whereas we were expecting uber casual beachy).  <START:Service> service <END>  was prompt and friendly and it was only a matter of time before our  <START:Food> lunches <END>  arrived - Caesar salad with shrimp  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and a Polynesian  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with sweet potato  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .  The Caesar dressing is amazing so I would recommend any of the Caesar salads here.  The Polynesian  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> excellent <END>  but definitely a little messy so if you are at Hulas on a first date or  <START:Food> lunch <END>  interview I would skip it.  :-).  For visitors from colder parts of the country, I can see where they would really enjoy the garage doors that roll up for access to the  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  outdoor  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  and to welcome Sonoran breezes.Not only is the  <START:Food> food <END>  good here but the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  too.  If you are fortunate enough to be there when the weather is ideal it's reminiscent of a San Diegan or Hawaiian ocean front  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  stand."

"I am a tiki aficionado and was looking forward to checking  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  out. The curb appeal is rather cool outside. Entering the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  it does have a real modern feel hence the word in their name. However, I was really really disappointed that there wasn't any tiki type props or  <START:A_Decor> decorations <END>  anywhere in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  other than the kitschy midcentury props stored  <START:A_Places> inside <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and the lonely only picture in the entire tiki themed  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  hidden in the corner - a Mark Ryden print. I just expected a lot more and was told by the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  that the other central location is better themed so I hope that they're going to make some additions as far as the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  goes . Now we had just eaten at Malee's Thai Room so we didn't sample any of the  <START:Food> food <END>  items. What we did have was this  <START:F_Drinks> giant scorpion bowl <END>  drink that was strong as heck and tasted awesome - flaming nectar of the gods it was. Bravo! Mr.  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> . We would have stayed just a little bit longer but there was an extremely intoxicated noisy loud platinum blonde Snottsdale bimbo screeching stupidity right next to my wife's ear so we decided to pack it up after one. I'll make my way down here again and check it out again and maybe downtown too."

"Ok I will admit it, I love Italian  <START:Food> food <END> .  I could eat  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  every night of the week. But when we go out to eat, it's rarely at an Italian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . You see, my grandmother was from Italy and cooked like you wouldn't believe. And because if that I'm a little (lot) picky about the quality of my Italian  <START:Food> food <END> . Leaving a hole in my dining out repertoire. Until now!!!If my grandmother was alive, even she would love the  <START:Food> food <END>  at La Fontana!  Took the whole family in on a Thursday for, regrettably, a quick bite. Oh how I wish I had two hours to sit and eat 5 courses of this  <START:P_F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> , authentic Italian cuisine!! We made it fast but it was amazing. First off the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is classic, loads of family pictures on the  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  and I'm pretty sure \"The Godfather\" score was playing in the background. We were greeted by Franco, the realist deal around. So warm and friendly, he made the entire experience feel more like eating at a beloved friends house than a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . We had  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  for the kids;  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce was as good as Grandmas. And that's a BIG deal in my family. I didn't get to taste a  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>  before they gobbled them up, but I heard they were tender and tasty. Husband had  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  parm;  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast lightly breaded, covered with sauce and melted mozz, a side of rigatoni- cooked to perfection. I had the Penne Alla  <START:F_FoodItem> puttanesca <END> . It comes with  <START:F_Ingredients> capers <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> olives <END> , they had no problem adding  <START:F_Ingredients> peas <END>  at my request. It was DIVINE. Again with the perfectly cooked  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  in a sauce that had nice deep flavor without being too spicy like some  <START:F_FoodItem> puttanesca <END> . We didn't have time for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  but I know I will go back and get my hands on their Tiramisu. Final verdict: YOU! Yes, you. Go now. Go tonight. Eat at La Fontana every chance you get. I know I will!!! Grandma would be proud! Ciao!"

"I could write a book on how good  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  is.  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is flawless.  I've had almost all of it.  Love all of it.   <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  rice is my clear fav!!!   You just gotta trust me and go and get some"

"Normally I wouldn't really look twice at a random sports  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but there aren't a ton of  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in LV (especially in my neighborhood) where you can bring kids and watch football. Bentley's gets points there because it's not super smoky, they serve  <START:Food> food <END> , and it's never packed, so there's plenty of  <START:A_Places> space <END>  for the kids to move around if they want.It's a pretty good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to watch football because there are lots of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tvs <END>  and you can get a speaker for your table if you ask.Bonus for the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  outside, looking at Sunset Park.However, they lose points several other  <START:Restaurant> places <END> : the management (after 2-ish years) has yet to change the outside sign from Nikki Lee's to Bentley's. It's dark and dirty-feeling  <START:A_Places> inside <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  is a little high  <START:W_Price> priced <END> .They can't even bother to print out a nice-looking  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  at FedEx and have it laminated. Instead they give you a photocopied version of the old one, stapled together (seriously).So overall, Bentley's is kinda divey (which is not my scene), but due to it's family-ish  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , we'll probably be back."

"I was torn between 3 stars or 2. What saved them was the  <START:Service> service <END> . Hostess seated us right away, our water glasses were ALWAYS full, and our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  visited us a few times to make sure everything was going ok.The reason for the low rating was the  <START:Food> food <END> . First of all charging over $3 for  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  \"tasters\" is ridiculous. When I go to a Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I expect to get  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> . Just like I expect to get bread and olive oil at an Italian  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . So we ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and some  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> .  <START:Food> portion <END>  was good but the taste was average. I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> swordfish   tacos   <END> . All in all they were very good. You get 4  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  in a serving and it came with a piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END>  was a cabbage and jalepineo mix which was VERY good.My wife ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchilada. So so...  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was ok but the smothered it with a creamy sort of dressing that ruined the dish.Probably won't go back."

"Really enjoyed  <START:Restaurant> this place <END> ! Went here for my birthday with family and I'm happy we did! We LOVE mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  and good  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> guacomole <END>  and Mercadito had both. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was a little confusing but that is very minor compared to how  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  was.Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  Amber was fabulous. She seemed very happy to be at work and was very knowledgeable. We got the 'unlimited 3  <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END> ,' and 'traditional  <START:F_FoodItem> guacomole <END> ,' to start with. Everything tasted sooo  <START:P_F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> . I'm a  <START:F_FoodItem> guacomole <END>  connoisseur (haha) and fell in love with Mercadito's guac. I'm already craving to go back for it. I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  and they were delish. You know its  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  when you can taste the freshness and that is what my family and myself kept talking about.I can't wait to go back & Thank you Amber for a  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>  experience!"

"Interesting location.  <START:P_F_FI_Taste> excellent <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:P_S_Stf_Behavior> great <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . Waiters are very nice people. Really injoyed my stay."
