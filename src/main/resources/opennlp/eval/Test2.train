I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  here...I've only visited in the past for  <START:Offers> happy   hour   <END>  or  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  out with friends. Recently, both times I came late in the evening after work functions and arrived hungry. Coincidentally, both nights I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was also  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  night.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's an interesting  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> , all ages, just gettin' their  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  on. I enjoy the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> , but will sit back and let the "pros" do the dancing.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have friendly  <START:Service> service <END> , a few outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and a huge  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a pretty  <START:Restaurant> lounge-y vibe <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a decent  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> / <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list, and also specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END> . Both times, I tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , which was not bad at all - not comparing to a Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but for a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was done well. The spicy one was really hot,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with a jalepeno: nice touch. I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the house  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which was a  <START:Food> meal <END>  in itself. Seriously  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was huge! The  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were fresh, and with some  <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  oil,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very enjoyable. For  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  fare, Bossa Nova is one happening spot in the downtown area, which seems to be on the up and up!

MacAlpine's is a staple of old Phoenix. Dating back to the30's, this  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>   <START:Service> serviced <END>  customers of the valley since 7st was a dirt road off the beaten path.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do a  <START:Service>   great   job <END>  retaining the  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END>  of an age gone by,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiched <END>  on both sides by antique and vintage stores.  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's plenty to look at. Unfortunately I can't say the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  or cow) were very  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> . Not bad, just  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  and uninspired. The  <START:F_Drinks> sodas <END>  are fun. On my first visit I tried 2 of the 99 options, including Marilyn Monroe (peach) and Tiger Blood (cherry  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END> ). Both were  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> , but next time I'm going to ask for way less syrup. All in all I'd say I would come back again and again, but probably just for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .

We came here last Sunday on Father's day for the  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for the  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END> . $25 for the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  style for the cold items and $10 extra for the unlimited made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  plates of 7 different hot items,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  not included. The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> , 4 diff  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , assorted  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked   salmon   <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> caviar <END> , varieties of  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> . I am not usually big fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  at  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but theirs were really  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfect. A bit disappointed that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put all the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimps <END>  on top but the bottom ones hidden under the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  ones were the  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  ones. The  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked   salmon   <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END>  were awesome.  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were very pretty and decent but mostly too sweet to my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were pretty  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> . We tried all the 7 hot plates to be shared among the 3 of us, the lamb was soooo delish that I had two  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and I don't usually even like the  <START:A_Environment> smell <END>  of lamb, but this didnt have the heavy  <START:A_Environment> smell <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem>   waffle  . <END> and  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  were really  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> , except that I didn't quite enjoy the combination of the  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  bits on the  <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END> . I also loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  mini  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . Polenta was yuck and the most raved  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  benedict was not special. I didn't get to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , but hubby said the  <START:F_FoodItem> macncheese <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was just average. We called ahead to let them know that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was also our anniversary and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would take note of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't appear that any note was made. I know  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's only  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  and not full dinner but would still appreciate a bit recognition on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , so I ended up asking the host if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  could do something. So came an empty plate with chocolate writing saying Happy Anniversary on  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and was told to get some  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  from the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  to put on the plate. May be that's how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I don't have complaint but was not exactly expecting an empty plate :) Overall, I would have no problem returning  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for a casual upscale  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .

What a find!!!  I drive by this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  all the time and always mentally say "humm Jess, you should try that  <START:Restaurant> place <END> " next time i am going to listen to my gut, because i was missing out!  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  is a very cute, cozy set up. everyone is super nice here. You get complimentary won ton  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and delicious Chinese  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  when you get  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ( this is pretty rare). The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  which lead us into gluttony...and people i am NOT ashamed because everything was derrrlicious :)edamame, ribs, angel puffs(crab puff),  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , lemon  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , honey walmut  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  (catching my breath)..sake..more hot  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ..and then  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  and chocolate for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ....yummmmhonestly i eat Chinese/Asian/Thai A LOT, and this was one of the best places i have came across in my quest for   <START:Service> great <END>  Asian  <START:Food> food <END> . why not  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END>  then you say?? well i am a fan of  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> (none here), and i just can't hand out  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END>  like candy. But def a high four!

Don't come for the  <START:Service> service <END> ...don't come for the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  or cleanliness...don't come for the other  <START:Food> food <END> . Come for the pie. Jack Daniel's Pecan is divine.  Lemon cream is outstanding. Rhubarb is top-notch.  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's no other reason to stop here and if you're driving by you need to stop here.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all about the pie.

I am use to going here for teppan ( <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and have always had a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Better than Benihana! <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and helpful.This was my first time here for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are  <START:Service> great <END> . I also  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer half  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  on some of their  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Teriyaki w/  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Tempura, comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> miso   soup   <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very tasty. And  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  amount of  <START:Food> food <END>  for $8.50. I also got Unagi  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , which was okay. I got to sample around at some of my friends  <START:Food> food <END> ...Hamachi Kama which I've never had was yummy and the Uni  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  (wasn't as bad as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looks:)We also got different  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  at the end, the Chocolate Tempura  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  Cream was heavy but yummy,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like a funnel cake with  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream. The Chocolate Soufflé was delicious, the warm chocolate filling made the  <START:Food> dish <END> . My favorite was the Flan (yes at a Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ),  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was reminiscent of creme brulee. The  <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  wasn't  <START:Service> great <END> , might have been in the freezer too long.

While the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in this spot doesn't hold a candle to I  <START:Restaurant> love <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Fever, the  <START:Service> service <END>  and half  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  make up for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  overall. I consistently have a  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  here and have never had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . Plus,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is very little bullsh$t at the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  which is sometimes appreciated on a "school" night. The Hibachi is another story altogether,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a tasty affair and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  is some of the best I've ever had! Most certainly  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a visit!

I've only been here once and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't busy so  <START:Service> service <END>  was not a problem when I went. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was soooo  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> ! We had the pernil which was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> moist <END>  and delicious, tostones, maduras,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , moros y cristianos. Omg everything was awesome! I will definitely go back!

 <START:S_Menu> excellent <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  Wished we had found this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  a couple years ago when we moved here.   <START:W_Price> price <END>  is  <START:S_Menu> excellent <END>  and  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  very comfortable.  Found our new "Chinese  <START:Food> cuisine <END> !"

Dinner for 4. Everyone was happy for the most part. My  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  was a little salty. Hubs  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was delish! Everything looked  <START:Service> great <END>  and our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was nice.

I have been to Azteca many times and have always been satisfied. This time not so much. I can't put my finger on the reason, but I have to wonder if this time was an exception, or if the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had changed. Before this visit I would have rated Azteca 4, but now  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a generous 3.

I have just discovered the Common Market and I couldn't be happier that I did.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  reminds me of a funky little deli from back home so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gives me the warm fuzzies while I peruse their killer  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have everything a micro brew lover could want, including big bottles and single serve, build your own 6 packs.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also have a  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  selection and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  even carry sake!   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are lots of  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END> ,  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  items, and organic choices, as well as off the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:Service> treats <END>  and trinkets like "Obama-mints."  I have never actually eaten at the deli, but I'm sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:Service> great <END>  too.  Oh and you can also buy single cigarettes for 33 cents.....so, if you are craving just one, CM is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go.

After  reading the Yelp reviews, I went to Diamond around 3pm in the afternoon for a "snack".  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a surprisingly sophisticated  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bloody mary made with their house mix, absolut  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with pickled  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> .  As I am watching the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  make the bloody mary, she puts the cheapest  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  in the glass and then precedes to pour a mix over  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  which had a terrible  <START:A_Decor> color <END> !  I  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  bloody mary.  This bloody mary was no bueno -  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END> , crappy mix and no pickled  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> .  On to the  <START:Food> food <END>  - I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  pickles.  The  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  pickles were  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  - the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were not.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were chewy, not spicy and  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END> .  Fast forward 3  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  and I feel terrible - in fact, I am in and out of the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  for a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  2 hours.  NEVER AGAIN.  If you're looking for  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> ,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> , greasy  <START:Food> food <END>  try Pinky's!

The queso is ridiculously  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> ... seriously. And the homemade tortillas are also outstanding.Aside from that, everything is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican  <START:Food> cuisine <END> . This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the  <START:Food> food <END> . Hence making  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.We started with the  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  set for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  - delicious. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bunch of queso for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , and I started with a Tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  scraps, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked the part.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  broth with a bunch of  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> , a gob of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  corn on the cob on top. Yes, a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  corn on the cob is on top.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was lousy and I wouldn't recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a pound of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  fajitas and a half pound of  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee).  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  went surprisingly far for five of us... but the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  weren't grilled much, which is sad because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were otherwise delicious. Also, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  fajitas only had one piece of green  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  and one of red on top.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  should be lush with  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  that have been grilled or possibly even  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> caramelized <END>  (the  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ).Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  should be "more than a pile of  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ," that he expected at least some green, red or yellow  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . The fajitas were  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent -  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.So much potential, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  fails on almost everything.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a true shame. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  needs to be on  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...This time around... the  <START:Service> service <END>  was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . Very disappointing. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  first replied confirming what size bug  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was, and then explained  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and claimed that "we're not dirty,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_Environment> smell <END> ." Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!And the entry foyer smelled like a high school locker  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was foul on the way in and out.Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had the cheapest and best falafil (that is how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  spell  <START:Restaurant> it <END> )  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  of anywhere in town.The falafel was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> moist <END> , flavorful the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  was fresh and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a copious amount of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to cover  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  was a bit  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  but that can be over looked. At under $3  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might be worthwhile to get two. As for the hummous we had on the side,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a  <START:Service> great <END>  texture but a bit low on  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . Make sure you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  an extra  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  comes with just one. We got the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to go so we did not really have any  <START:Service> service <END>  to review.  When you first walk in you are assaulted by the smells of many spices and many other alien things to most Americans.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is an attached  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  market full of spices, and exotics  <START:Food> foods <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice. The counter is full of many types of balaclava and  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> .If you want a  <START:Service> great <END>  falafel  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  at a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:W_Price> price <END> , be brave and stop in. Just leave your Pro Bush / Israel gear in the car.

Ok, I get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  that everyone is excited you finally opened.We (party of 5) came in today for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .After asking two  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  3 time for  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and half way thru my  <START:Food> meal <END> , I finally got  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> .  I also asked our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for the habanero  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  which I had to remind him again half way thru my  <START:Food> meal <END> .  After  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  our check 2 of decided to have a shot of corralejo tequila. I went to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where I stood for over 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  while the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  watched the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  ignoring me. I left and the returned, still no  <START:Service> service <END> .  I finally said in a loud voice to the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> . Quit watching the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and get me our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . This is a terrible way to keep customers.  Not sure we will return.  $30 for 2 shots that I pretty much had to beg to get is rediculous.  Happy Holidays.

 <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the best BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  I've ever had in Las Vegas!!!! I also tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> pot stickers <END>  and orange  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> !! All  I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to all who enjoy  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and a relaxing dining  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END> !

You can't really go wrong when you walk into a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a beautiful bottle of peppery Zinfandel and a decadent  <START:Food> meal <END>  with all your favorite things.  I was dazzled with my dinner choice comprised of a petite file mignon  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with crab, drizzled with a crab mignonette cream, goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  whipped  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  fritti, sauteed wild  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and brussel sprouts sauteed in pancetta, lemon, and browned  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> .  Not to mention that I had the best key lime pie yet! Simply flavorful, simply  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , and simply a  <START:Service> great <END>  choice to satisfy my craving for  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  Hats off to the Palm!

i always come here once a year for the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  bordelaise n pomme  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> !! Their  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  is the only one i would eat..  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are so  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  n tasty. <START:F_FoodItem> escargot <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> .. for adventurous foodie... n not for the faint hearted... or country bumpkin who's not open minded to try anything at least once.the pate is  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> .. the  <START:F_Drinks> roasted butternut squash   soup   <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> ...

If you ever want to eat somewhere with delicious  <START:Food> food <END>  and have stunning  <START:A_OutsideView> views <END>  of the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  show at the Bellagio, this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to be!  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END> 's had incredible  <START:Service> service <END>  and appetizing  <START:Food> food <END> ! My boyfriend and I had our Anniversary dinner here and let me just say,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is one that I'll never forget. A few tips:Make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and if you don't mind eating a early dinner, make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for 5, that's when dinner starts. You'll for sure get a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  or  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> . <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , a nice dinner is not complete without a tasty  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  bellinis and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were perfect.Don't eat too much  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  because the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are pretty decent. From  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty hard for me to stop snacking on the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> . But you want  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for their mouthwatering  <START:Food> entrees <END> ! I had the ricotta  <START:F_FoodItem> raviolis <END>  with italian sausage and my boyfriend had the goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dumplings with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , this was mainly where my 5 star rating came from. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazingly delectable!!!!!!!

Never in my life did I  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  myself hitting up a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Vegas. What can I say.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  always seemed gimmicky I guess. So I crashed here for a night. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  was pimp and exceeded expectation. I had been driving all freaking day and in dire need of something delicious. No  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> , no  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END>  and screw eating shit from the mini  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . So me and buddy mosey on down to the   <START:Food> buffet <END>  while gawking at the numerous hot females walking around.Back to the  <START:Food> food <END> . Everything was  <START:Service> great <END>  first and foremost. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was just okay,  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  and the selection of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  was pretty eh. Anyway not  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . The Prime Rib was really juicy and satisfied my craving for blood. The  <START:F_FoodItem> king crab legs <END>  were really  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were mighty tasty. The  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  stuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  things were  <START:Service> great <END> , smothered in a creamy white  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Pesto mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , duck,  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> spareribs <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , dim sum, everything was really  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  was overall pretty  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> . I left this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  feeling like a really content blob. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:Service> great <END>  and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were pretty  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> . Nice  <START:Food> buffet <END> ...  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  enough to wipe my  <START:Food> buffet <END>  grudge away for the time being.

BASED ON  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  TO-GO:First of all, can we give a shout out to all joints that serve their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  all day? *applause* Already started off with 1 star.2nd star came when we found out we could  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to-go &  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be ready to pick up in 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , smack dab in the middle of their morning rush. *High-five Lux!*3rd star came when we picked up our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  off to the side of the entrance where the bakery is and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  conveniently had other items like baked goods and all different kinds of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I see you, Lux. I see you!4th star came when I bit into that scrumptious  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  sammich. That bad boy was huge! I thought I had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two of them or something. But don't me wrong, I still devoured that sucker,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just took me a little longer. Only thing is that I wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put a  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  bit more effort into their hash browns. Mine were kinda  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  and barely  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . Another off note: we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  ranch over the phone, when we picked up we also confirmed if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  packed the ranch ( <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did), but when we got back to our  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> , no ranch to be seen. Bummer cause ranch is my boo boo. Not cool, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  happens.Something to note- I'm not sure of its connection to The Cheesecake Factory:  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  used to be one?  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's owned by the same company? Not sure but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  definitely had the same vibe and I  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  me some CF so I ain't mad at  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !I would definitely come back!

We went here because we got a  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card for Xmas, I thought  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delish we stared off with the calamari was a little under seasoned but not fishy, the complementary  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was  <START:Service> great <END>  and then we had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flatbread that was  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was the nicest ever. We had a fifty dollar  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card and ended up using $38 on dinner and two  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and gave the rest to her for being super nice. Would go again even without a  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card.

This review is coming from someone who was born and raised in HK. We have different standard on Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  than people from other culture. If you happened to be from an area outside of Canton/HK this review will not help you. This used to be my most favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Vegas for its high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  authentic cantonese  <START:Food> cuisine <END> ...yet the most recent visit proved to a a disaster...this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had lost its authentic cantonese  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , the pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  was saturated with gravy, my pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was over filled with sweet and sour  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was supposed to be  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END> ), and the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  rib  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just gross.  <START:Service> service <END>  is ok; but I would say that  <START:Food> food <END>  had downgraded to American Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  style...I will not come back.

I  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END>  is beautiful and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious.

 <START:Service> great <END>  creativity and fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . Execution?  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> , but not stellar. Most of us had luke warm  <START:Food> food <END> , but I was too lazy (since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt like forever to get our  <START:Food> food <END> ), to cry about  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and send  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. More like a 3-4 range, but the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and temperature were lacking.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do have an awesome smores mocha that you should probably share. Actually, share anything you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  because the portion will be monster. We came for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  on a Friday and had a short  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . Best thing was probably my friend's banana  <START:F_FoodItem> french toast <END> . That was tasty and the broiled (?) bananas were the perfect addition. Would I go again for that  <START:W_Price> price <END> ? Probably not. Maybe the San Diego sister  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  would be better....

Fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hangout at, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have this really cool bridge.........lol

My wife and I go here a couple times a year for quite a while now.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is very  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> , as is the  <START:Service> service <END> . I usually get the lasagna without looking much at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  The house chianti works well.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all certainly  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  enough that we keep going back.  The  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END>  is usually quiet, even when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is busy.  That means we can talk easily in a calm voice.On the nights that Augie is  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  with his accordion, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is usually busier, and I have to think  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's at least partly because of Augie.  He doesn't just play around with the squeeze box--he's  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> !  He's a classically trained musician, and really puts himself into  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , especially when he knows you appreciate  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .

This review should be split into two categories:  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was 5- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .  Flavorful, generous, and delicious.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was 2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .  Our party was one of two in the entire  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  Due to the fact the 3  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  in another part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  catching up, I had to get up and request  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and other things we needed.  From start to finish,  <START:Food> lunch <END>  for 3 people took close to 1.5 hours between  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for  <START:Service> service <END> .  Always happy to find a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  Ethiopian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and definitely recommend the  <START:Food> food <END>  here.  Just plan on the extra time for the  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  you will do.

Our favorite Mediterranean  <START:Food> food <END>  in the valley. Huge  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> swarms combo <END>  are our favorite. Also recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> roasted lamb hummus <END> . Phoenicia is awesome!

 <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  We enjoy the  <START:Food> food <END> , but I believe the Naperville, IL  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is better.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seem to offer a larger variety of specials.  But, and thats a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  but, the Scottsdale  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is still a must try.  My favorite item is the Quinoa  <START:F_FoodItem>   veggie     burger   <END> .

I think I would have to agree with Kristin and Sunny and say that this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  gets a lot more credit that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might otherwise deserve because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a non-chain, non-fast  <START:Food> food <END>  Chinese  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in South Phoenix. I admire the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  for taking a risk and opening this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in this particular area and for bringing some ethnic  <START:Food> food <END>  to the masses. That being said, the  <START:Food> food <END>  isn't spectacular. The first time my husband and I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was at dinnertime and we thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  Honey  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  ($7.95) was a bit too sweet and not as  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  as one would hope, but the Mongolian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  ($9.50) was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and pretty flavorful. We also had the Crab Puffs for $4.95, which were fine but no better than the ones at Panda Express. The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were low,  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> , and overall,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was an ok dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . However, when we returned for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today, we were a bit disappointed. Having enjoyed a  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  during the last visit, I decided to try the Volcano  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  special. My husband got the General Tso  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Their website says  <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials are $4.95, but I believe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were $5.50 each. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was ok, but again,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't that  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , General Tso  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and other similar  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are only really  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  if the outside is very  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  adds  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  not sogginess. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that came with the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was spicy and flavorful and the accompanying  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  (carrot,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END> , and bok choy) were really fresh, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  itself was really bad  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . On the upside, the  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  that came with both  <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials was really  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> . The filling was savory, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  almost  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  in  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> ! I am certainly glad that the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  of Sun Asian  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  brought Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  to South Phoenix, but I hope that many more Asian restaurateurs follow suit and open  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in this area, so that Kristin, Sunny, and I have more options to choose from! Until then, I'll be frequenting Sun Asian  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  for  <START:Offers> happy   hour   <END>  (in particular, for the $3 crab puffs) or to-go and driving elsewhere when I went real,  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> - <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Asian  <START:Food> food <END> .

I went here today.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and was told  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're out of  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> .  Are you serious?  That's a first ever for me.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  was like $7.  That's an insane  <START:W_Price> price <END>  for a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  but I was hungry so I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END> .  I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  about fifteen  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  to come out and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was only one other customer in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  When the  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  finally arrived  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was cold and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't provide any napkins.  I was thoroughly disappointed and will not go back again.  Now I'm starting to feel sick.

All I can say is the horrible  <START:Service> service <END>  overrode everything that could possibly have been  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  about the  <START:Food> food <END> .  The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  of this  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  was very cool and hip and had an abundance of open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  which was most welcome coming into phoenix from Michigan winter that same day.  However, our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> not   good   <END>  at all!  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END>  for over 10 mins. and when I needed a refill, because that was all I was drinking, forget about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I had to flag another  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  down while I could see my  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  rolling silverware.  We were eating with another couple and she never asked if we wanted the bill split either which I thought was unacceptable. Ok...for the  <START:Food> food <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  verde which was very flavorful and the cornbread that came with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I wished I had more of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  My husband had the kale and Brussel sprouts and kale  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which he thought was very  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  were just that, nothing special.  Even with the hen  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> .  The other couple we were with had been here several times and obviously have had much different  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  than we had because I don't think I would go back unless  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was for a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a pretty  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  looking list and the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area had  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and  <START:A_Places> space <END>  to mingle.

One of my favorite things about Home Plate is that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  friendly on the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining side <END>  and perfectly " <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> " friendly on the gaming side.  I only wish  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was smoke free on both, but I know that will never happen in Vegas.  Both sides of the  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  (separated by  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  glass  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> ) have a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  number of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> televisions <END> ... some are a bit outdated and could use an upgrade, but big numbers just the same.  The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining side <END>  also has a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> arcade <END>  area which is PERFECT for bringing the kids, especially when the adults would like to hang out for a while, but the kids don't have the attention span to do so.  All of the  <START:Food> food <END>  I have had here (mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ) is  <START:S_Menu> excellent <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> .  Definitely an once/month spot for us and would be more if we lived closer.

I asked for  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  mustard and Delvin over did  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I asked him to take some of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  off and he looked at  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  like how? I just told him take of the first layer and he did with his glove n  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  got messy.  Then he stick his hands in the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  with the same glove full of mustard. Smh! Then he tells me i have to ask for  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  mustard i said excuse me? Yes I did you didn't hear me.

I consistently have a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  when I come here.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is quick and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  (edamame!) and overall  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  We frequent this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when we want to have a decently healthy  <START:Food> meal <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  teriyaki bowl with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  is straightforward and tasty.  Plus,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  always have coupons!

For the  <START:W_Price> price <END> ... you can do much better.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  and the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  was elegant, with  <START:Service> amazing <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  I think of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  as a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  date  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  if you have  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to blow and want to try to impress someone.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are plenty of better places to go in Vegas.  Since its in a casino,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't seem to have a dress code, despite its the kind of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you would expect to have one.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was nearly empty when we walked in... perhaps that was a clue that we should not have stayed.

Had a solo dinner here at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  while in town for business. First plus, the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  steered me away from a bad  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Redirected to the drunken sailor, I was a very happy camper after a long day of meetings. I followed  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  up with the  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END> /peach  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  and was even happier. I am a huge  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  fan (and make a darn  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  one). I usually do not like  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  varieties but this was intriguing. The two conventioneers next to me slugging Yuengling(don't get me wrong, I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but in a Cuban  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ?) were also intrigued.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was tasty and fresh.The  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  had  <START:S_Menu> excellent <END>  recommendations on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  as well. The Fire and  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  seviche was a winner, providing  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and some nice heat. The  <START:F_FoodItem> empanada <END>  was a nice follow-up but the seviche starred.   <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and all at a reasonable  <START:W_Price> price <END> .

Killer  <START:Food> food <END> . I only had one  <START:Food> dish <END>  out of about 12 things I tried that I didn't like.

I  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  that all of the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  here is fair trade and organic! This is a friendly neighborhood  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  which is often filled with families and lots of little kids.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also serve some  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  type  <START:Food> foods <END>  including  <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  and cereal as well as somewhat fancier  <START:Food> lunches <END> . I've had better  <START:F_Drinks> cappuccinos <END>  elsewhere, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're acceptable here. Unfortunately, the WiFi is rather hit and miss -- sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  works and sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't, but at least  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's free.

will  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go a few times before bumping to 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ....but first time was awesome!had to get the LV  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END> ...delicious. that sage  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  rocks. and the dill relish compliments  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ridiculously well.  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  itself was  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> , too. paired  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  w/ some cottage  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  w/ cayenne sour cream to dip in and a big cold sprecher root  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , on tap no less. <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a  <START:Service> great <END>  looking  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  selection of creative dogs, sausages,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and sammiches), nice selection of sides ( <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  pickles and  <START:F_FoodItem> green   beans   <END> !) and a surprisingly decent  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection (for a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  grill). plus malts,  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END> , etc.and.... <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have vegetarian options. my girl is vegetarian....want to take her here so she can try a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  brat! (kinda curious about how a  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  brat  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  myself....)

Had a very poor  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  related to customer  <START:Service> service <END> . Arrived to to get  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  for a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at 12:30pm.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would not take names and hold  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were  <START:S_Menu> limited <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  open at that time, but only two of eight in our party had arrived so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  wouldn't  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us.  We mentioned our party was expected around 1.  Around 1  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  started a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  list and were not helpful when we asked to be listed on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had not looked to save any  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  or opportunities to hold our group and were very rude when we asked again to try and be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .  The rest of our party showed by 1:15 and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  included 3 kids. At that time,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was nowhere for us to sit.   By 2pm,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had not followed up with us at all or tried to be courteous.  In fact,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very unprofessional during the entire process.  I complained to the management since  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  "had no idea" about how long  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be to try and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us. While I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for more than an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  still made no effort to hold smaller  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  open to try and accommodate our party.  By just after 2pm we said we were leaving and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seemed shocked.  Was also very frustrated  <START:S_Staff> the manager <END>  did not really try to solve any issues and help us out.  I didn't even get to eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  but my co-workers had  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  other days and said their  <START:Food> meals <END>  were "OK."  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need to improve their approach to  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END> .  If  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would have been more accommodating we would have been a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  party with huge  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> .  Instead,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ruined our day and their reputation among a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group of potential customers.

Totally enjoyable, every person that I have taken here is forever a fan of Honey Pig!The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Brisket and Bulgogi are sooooooooooooo  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> !!!

Fun  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END>  and pretty  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:Service> great <END> , we kept having people join our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very accommodating.

I  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  the  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  here! I've been coming here every other weekend since moving to Montreal! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick and friendly. The  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  is casual, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a huge variety of chocolates at the front to purchase! I work nearby so I come here often to grab  <START:Food> lunch <END> , or a chocolate snack. The  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  is only served on weekends! I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I would come again and again! <START:Food> food <END>  -   <START:Service> amazing <END> ! <START:Service> service <END>  - Friendly and quickAmbiance - CasualWorth the  <START:W_Price> money <END>  - Yes!

My favorite bistro in all of Montreal. From the  <START:Service> great <END>  hors d'oeuvres to the fabulous  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> , this is a spot you just can't afford to miss. Located in the French quarter, l'express is a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that is lays packed and full of eclectic people.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END>  but be sure to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  l'ile flottante before  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sell out and don't forget the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  to finish off the evening.

Terrible  <START:Service> service <END> , very pretentious  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  for 20 min once and in the end  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  turned out  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot ! Sold me a day old  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> ...

My wife and I first went to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on Rea Road twice and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fantastic both times! We came to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's closer to us and because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a chain, we thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  would be just as  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  as the one on Rea Road. We were severely disappointed.

 <START:Restaurant> it <END>  an okay  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for pho... Nothing "wow" factor....  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  was more  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ... Not to mention very little herbs given

As I've always wanted to go here, my fiancé surprised me by taking me the The Witchery for my birthday this evening. Maybe I came in with incredibly high expectations but I found that the hype of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  far outweighs what you get. I was not particularly  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with any  <START:Food> dish <END>  I received, to be completely honest. While the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is not "bad" by any means,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems as though  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's coasting on a name, rather than the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END> . The Witchery seems to do  <START:Food> food <END>  that is very classic, which is  <START:Service> great <END>  if that's what you're looking for. However, I was expecting the classic  <START:Food> food <END>  to have something which set  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  apart from other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . In short, I saw nothing like that and was served a few fancy looking  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that were not nearly the calibre of  <START:Food> food <END>  I would expect from a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  this "legendary" or in such a  <START:W_Price> price <END>  point. I have eaten at several world class  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  and have experienced better  <START:Food> dishes <END>  at a fraction of the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  in more cosmopolitan hubs (Vegas, NYC, etc). Not only that, but I found the  <START:Service> service <END>  to be dismal overall. The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were very kind but not  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  enough. I recognize that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  can be a cultural divide between American (which I find far too hands on) and British  <START:Service> service <END>  but this didn't even begin to straddle the line. We were left to our own devices with only a check in every half  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  (if that). The last straw, which I'm not sure was intentional or not, was that I wasn't asked if i wanted my credit card charge to be in dollars or pounds. For most people this isn't a big deal, but I travel enough to know that establishments make extra  <START:W_Price> money <END>  if one  <START:O_Payment> pays <END>  in foreign currency...I would think a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of this calibre would know exactly what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are doing when hey run something like that, which I find dishonest. The Witchery gets extra points for acknowledging and doing something sweet for my birthday but overall, I'd recommend people look to other places in Edinburgh for  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  seems like a tourist trap that's lazy bc of their legacy. Personally, I felt  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a waste of  <START:W_Price> money <END> .

So I've never had Vietnamese Pho before (pronounced fu, as in fun, without the n) and I decided to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with a friend of mine who speaks Vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and what I was eating and also steer me to the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in town so I'd have a positive initial Pho  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and want to go back again and again.unPHOgettable is tucked into an Asian cultural center just south of Main Street on Dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the Asian grocery story, but has  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's own entrance and  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> eating area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had a pretty nice  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  was very helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (I figured  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  either eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  quite a bit, or the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  remembers him because he doesn't likely see very many tall, geeky, white kids who speak Vietnamese). The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  offered to go over the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  with us, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was our first time, but my friend told him that he would handle  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty clean and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very helpful. My only minor complaint was that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a minor  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  odor in the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END> , but I wasn't quite sure if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  or the adjoining Asian grocery store that had the fishy  <START:A_Environment> smell <END> . Either way  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't overpowering and didn't detract from our  <START:Food> meal <END>  at all.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  Pho with  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END> . I have to admit, that when I looked at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I thought  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> tenderloin <END> , so I assumed I was  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  strips of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  junks.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't until my friend's wife repeated my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  with an emphasis on  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END>  that I realized what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . Either way though, I'm pretty adventurous so I figured I'd give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a shot. My wife  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a flat  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  instead of the  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  since she's had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before. The  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of Pho with all the trimmings. I added a decent amount of hoisen  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and an even more decent amount of hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red. I added in my  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, tore up my  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  and plopped in my jalapeños to boot. I dug in and was amazed at how  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> . I wasn't really amazed that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> , but that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  SO  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  AND I'd never had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before. Why had people kept this a secret from me?  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fantastic and right up my alley.  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> , hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . I wolfed mine down and even tried my wife's  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> , not really enough to give a thorough review, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> , and I'd try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  again.The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  weren't bad, I ended up  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  about $22 for the two of us to eat our  <START:Food> meals <END>  and a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  split between 4 people. Range: $7.50 - $12.00.Sorry for posting without pictures, but I'm sure I'll be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl.Because of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , I am now a fan of Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END> , specifically the Pho  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .Rating: 5.0http://dietstartstomorrow.com/post/2982603033/unphogettable-mesa

This will be my first visit to a Korean BBQ joint here in Vegas and I was delightfully surprised.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fairly traditional with a decent selection (tripe was a nice addition). The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  needed to be; quick to switch out grill tops and refill  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END> , but that is rarely a deal-breaker for me at these places. To explain to those that may have been to different style Korean BBQ's, this is the type that is  <START:Food> buffet <END>  style, not the dim sum style. I typically compare Korean  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  on their kalbi, and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  stacks up right around the 3 star range. Having been to, in my opinion, some of the best domestic Korean BBQ's back in Queens, NY, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  filled the void rather nicely. I'll definitely return for my monthly dose of pig intestine, And for 18$ a head? Gun bae!

I came upon Paradise Bakery by chance and just stopped by to have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and something sweet. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a caramel  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> snickerdoodle cookie <END> , and a  <START:F_Dessert> sugar cookie <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all okay, but not fantastic. I think  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a little pricey for what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  was pretty nice and seemed like a nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to study or read, but I probably wouldn't choose to go back.

This a  <START:Service> great <END>  deli, by airports standards or otherwise.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a fairly  <START:S_Menu> limited <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> wraps <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and prompt, which is  <START:Service> great <END>  when you're rushing to a flight. Try the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  and cranberry  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is  <START:Service> great <END> ! This is my go to for a quick  <START:Food> meal <END>  before heading to the security line.

 <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  but apparently  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't want to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the rent.  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is closed, locked up with a sign saying the lien holder has taken over. Guess I have to find a new  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now. Damnit.

Went here to break Passover this yearWhat we sampled:  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sampler      Definitely a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  way to try different  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , to get an idea of what you like. I was really interested in the Hefeweizen with  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of banana and clove.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was definitely interesting smelled like bananas and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like cloves.  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  sample     The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and pretzels were  <START:Service> great <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sauerkraut balls <END>  were definitely interesting.  I wasn't such a big fan of the potato  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  though.  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  spatzel     Total winner of the night.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was awesome. Apple Streudel     A classic, though I don't know if I would  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  again.  Not really my thing.  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:Service> great <END>  and helpful!

 <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  a little on the spicey side. Kind of  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  could've been bigger.  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>    <START:Service> service <END> .

 <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> , but like a previous comment,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gets harder and harder to keep going back.  The way  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  process  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  is annoying, but that's not a deal-breaker if the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I've  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  mostly.   <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>   <START:W_Price> cost <END>  extra.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  isn't remarkable.  Overall the  <START:Food> food <END>  is just okay -  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  enough to stop by if  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's on the way to somewhere else -  <START:O_Experience> not   good   <END>  enough to make a trip specifically to dine  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .

I was really unimpressed.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get a weak 3 based mainly on the  <START:Service> service <END>  which was the strong point of the visit this morning.Arriving about 8 on a Thursday morning the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was about full.  Given the choice between a booth and the counter I chose a booth.   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  decaf which  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was afresh pot brewing and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came in a few  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Country  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  (normally $5.99 but was the daily special at $4.99) with 2  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , a split biscuit with gravy and 2 slices of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> .The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  were ok.  I prefer a sausage gravy rather than the  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  gravy  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  make but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ok.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was tasty but  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and not lean.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were runny in the middle.The building and  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  was showing a lot of wear.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ware a lot of regulars even after the morning rush of folks heading off to work.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was really  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  and friendly.Overall this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was a reasonable value in that you could get a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  at fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  with  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  Not sure I would make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  part of a regular rotation but I may stop again because of where  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is in relation to where I travel.

I used to think Sephora was my "Happy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ," but that was until I went to Hough's.  Hough's is my happy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , and also you can't  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  at Sephora.So.Many. <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> !  At reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> !!!  Every time I leave the Sharp Edge I feel like I've left the bulk of my personal wealth  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Not at Hough's!   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's everything that's  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  about the Sharp Edge, and you're not going to go broke.I also really liked that the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list was seperated by brewery, bc I am a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  snob.  Not a fan of Dogfish, but I do  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  my Troeg's.  I also really liked that on the back of the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer descriptions of each of the different  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  so you can sound like you know what the hell you are talking about when discussing the random  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  you've just  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> .  "I like the fruity finish of this Kolsch.  I believe this brewery is from a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  basement in a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  upstate NewYork town you've never heard of!"Pro tip:   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's winter.   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a black IPA or a Winter Warmer, don't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a Kolsch.  Ever.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are just  <START:O_Experience> not   good   <END> .My current favorite  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  at Hough's is 21st Ammendment Fireside Chat.  Try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  You'll  <START:Restaurant> love <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is my "thing" and I know what's up.  You'll like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , trust me.  I had a lot of  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was knowledgeable, and according to my friend (a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> ), she was also hot.  He appreciated that.The only thing I didn't like was the cold  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are certain  <START:Food> foods <END>  I call, " <START:S_Staff> guy <END>   <START:Food> foods <END> ."  Stuff  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>   <START:Restaurant> love <END>  and chicks are grossed out by.  This was one of them, bc my friend ate the whole thing while I poked at  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and said, "Is this just a block of cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  with shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  mixed in?"  I'm pretty sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was.  But my friend loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .I'll def be back, and you should go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  too!

Ate here on our trip to Vegas last year using a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .com certificate.  Gotta  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  the places that let you include liquor the coupon.  We each had a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  that was delicious and not weak.  We shared the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  nachos that were  <START:S_Menu> excellent <END> .  Shared a couple other  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  that also hit the mark well.  A bit  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  of a  <START:A_Places> space <END>  and you get to know your neighbors well.   <START:Service> great <END>  deal with the certificate.

Well call me Sheila and throw another  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  on that barbie. Ok, so  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's no Australian connection to Treacle, but the King Prawn  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  box I had here today was by far the best  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , and the best EVER  <START:F_FoodItem> king   prawns   <END> , I've ever had. We're talking about all my culinary  <START:O_Experience> dining   experiences   <END>  internationally here, and I've done all the whole med- <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  scene ample times.The  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were fresh off the barbie, really charred and flavoursome and juicy and mmm. Seriously, just...if you like  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END> , go and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  that  <START:Food> dish <END> . I want another one now, and I only had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  3 hours ago. As far as  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  go  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was better than any chinese takeaway I've had too. So, as far as my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of Treacle goes,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a pub and a gastro-pub, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is exceptional. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  doesn't give that away.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has the standard pies,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , open  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  etc. and doesn't seem to hint that  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 'll be anything other than  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  pub  <START:Food> food <END> . But ohmylord. Everything I've had here has just been exceptionally well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  deserves every single one of these 5 sexy  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .I can't recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  highly enough for delicious pub grub. Read my other reviews of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  previously for an idea of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I am now definitely one of its biggest fans.

This is one of my all time favorite  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spots near my work. My girlfriend introduced this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to me a few months ago when I was craving Viet  <START:Food> food <END> . She encouraged me to try the bahn mi  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  I immediately fell in  <START:Restaurant> love <END> . As I got to explore the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .. I quickly found this spot to have some the best pho I've ever had.. from living in California to now recently residing in Vegas. The rare  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>  is awesome especially when you get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  served on the side instead of already mixed in the broth allows you to drop in at your leisure to get soft "rare" slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .. very flavourful! .. <START:Service> great <END>  cure for hangovers! I really enjoy the bbq  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are  <START:Service> amazing <END>  (always fresh). The peanut dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  for the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  is definitely on point and is a must try if you eat here. Also the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are very reasonable and just a  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for friends and  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  to get  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  local Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END> !

I was really  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  at Sage Garden!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  catered a meeting for us and  I thought their  <START:Food> food <END>  really stood out: <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came in (on time) and set  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all up for us in a timely/professional manner (as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a working  <START:Food> lunch <END> ) <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> -  <START:S_Menu> excellent <END> , I had  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  & swiss although  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , ham, and I believe roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  to choose from.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all served on soft croissant  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  A veg option would have been  <START:Service> great <END>  and some individual mustard/mayo's rather than a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  one for all to share ( the germaphobe in me would have appreciated  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .) <START:S_Staff> they <END>  provided potato  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which was DELICIOUS! Red  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , green  <START:F_Ingredients> onion <END> , mayo -based, non-sweet, with almost a hint of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was really  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also gave us some incredible chocolate brownies, which were just so  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  I wish I grabbed one more before I left. Overall the  <START:Food> food <END>  was really delicious-  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a step above many of the other franchised options. Fresh and tasty, just the way I like my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to be : ) I'd  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  them.

Of Wolfley and Man! (Metallica Reference!)I came here for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with an associate and I wanted to try something new. Wolfley's was definitely something you can't find anywhere in the country so what the hey! I would have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  their hometown favorite roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  warned me  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was quite salty.  I'm glad she did since I don't take kindly on overly salty  <START:Food> foods <END> . So I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheeseburger <END>  sliders instead. Let's just say I wasn't sure if should have sucked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  up and tried the roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  instead. Sliders were, well sub par and basic.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came along with some  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> onion <END>  flakes. I needed to douse  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with some ketchup to help me swallow  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . My  <START:Food> meal <END>  also came along with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which was probably the better of the two. However, I found a few brown leaves and tried to work around  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  overall and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty well put together. Definitely a cool  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang with the boys for a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . I went on Wolfey's website and notice  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are fond of charitable work and non-profits coming to their  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  - Kudos! Then again in my honest opinion I'm not sure I would want to recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  unless  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . - Enjoy!

The strip mall exterior belies the treasure within! When you enter, you're immediately  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  by the  <START:A_Environment> smell <END>  of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Normally the  <START:A_Environment> smell <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is not a pleasant one for me. As in, makes me lose my appetite. So,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a huge compliment when I say, the smells coming out of the open  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  are mouthwatering. When one of my dining companions received her  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were yet more mouthwatering aromas. WTH kind of alchemy is going on in that  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  make this vegetarian salivate over dead animal? No matter, fellow lovers of the plant plate,  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's options for you here. For starters, you *must*  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the Brussels sprouts ( <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do come with panchetta, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  can be left off). DIEvine. Seriously. As are the roasted root  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . I  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  when something simple is so delicious.I normally never eat mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's so two-note (duh), but Beckett's  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  makes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so that I finally *get* why people are all gaga over this stuff.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's very subtle, but those mustard seeds take the  <START:Food> dish <END>  to a whole other level of delish bliss. My  <START:Food> entree <END> , the oven roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  tower was probably the least exciting thing I ate last night night, but still flavorful in its own right and beautifully plated. I'm just not a fan of roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  which comprise about half of the stack. I'll leave this  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  meh at that, because the entire  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  blows that away into the ether. Next up,  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . Although thoroughly stuffed at this point, I managed a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> potato pie <END>  (incredible), the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry cobbler <END>  (delightfully tart, balanced with a sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream) and the piéce de resistance, fig (yes, I said fig) and  <START:F_FoodItem> pecan pie <END> .I'd be remiss to not mention the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  list, which seemed quite creative.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard for me to choose, but I had the Az Farmhand, which has Hendricks gin,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> , ginger,  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  and honey, many of my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  did not disappoint. Fabulous selection of wines by the glass, too.A thoroughly lovely  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  from start to finish, Beckett's  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  provides top notch  <START:Food> food <END>  at affordable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> , with impeccable  <START:Service> service <END>  in a rustic  <START:A_Environment> environment <END>  (you feel like you're in the hippest, coziest lodge).

Too bad the  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> schmear <END>  were delicious, because the  <START:Service> service <END>  was terrible. When I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  +  <START:F_FoodItem> matzo <END>  ball (which was alright but not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  $5.99) I asked for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  in the plastic container to go, I was argued with, being told the paper like container was more safe and better for  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> ... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  promptly spilled because the lid wasn't tight enough, and in my car.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  looks  <START:Service> amazing <END>  when you walk in and feel like you have entered a 70's  <START:Food> diner <END> . Then the longer you spend  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  the less  <START:Service> amazing <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  became. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is terrible and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took forever to get our  <START:Food> food <END> . I made my own  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  but found the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  has no seasoning at all, just  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  made into a patty and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were not bad but the mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> not   good   <END>  at all,  one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  was enough for me. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  looked  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  but i am sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was like most of the stuff in this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Looks  <START:Service> great <END>  but leaves a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in your mouth.

We initially wanted to go to Wicked Spoon for the  <START:Food> buffet <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were about to close to prepare for dinner. We saw Holsteins along the way and decided to check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out. We both got the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , which was okay. My son enjoyed the  <START:F_FoodItem> mini sliders <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, but maybe a bit overpriced, mostly likely due to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in the Cosmo. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was fantastic and really catered to our kids needs.

 <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty much all  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  and barely any  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . My boyfriend got sick from the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  he had. Won't go back.

This was hands down the best  <START:Food> meal <END>  I had during my recent trip to Phoenix.Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was very friendly and helpful - walking us through the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , making suggestions, and just being overall very pleasant.My husband and I started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Belly Pastrami, which was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and delicious.  We scarfed down the whole thing.For  <START:Food> entrees <END> , I went with the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  were nicely prepared, but I could have eaten a whole bowl of just the  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> . Mm - so so  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> .My husband had the  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>  which were definitely the right way to go.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were delicious.And, even though we were both too full to move, I really wanted to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  pudding, so we went for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  So.  <START:W_Price> worth <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  The only unfortunate thing was that at 8:00 on the Sunday night before Columbus day, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was pretty much empty.  I would have expected more of a  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt a little ... i don't know..not happening. But, despite the lack of a  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  stands on its  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in AZ

 <START:Service> amazing <END>  little  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have some seriously wonderful  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . You can't go wrong with the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  board, the  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbreads <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> charcuterie board <END> , or the  <START:F_FoodItem> warm brie <END> ...  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're all to die for! OH, the  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END>  are  <START:Service> great <END>  too! I wasn't thrilled with the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  to be honest, but that was my only disappointment. One more thing I was simply so bummed about was  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  discontinued the rock  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and that was my FAVORITE. I still ask every time I go in just to see if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will bring  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. :) You just cannot beat the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection, the delicious  <START:Food> food <END> , and the  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> . This is a must try!

I was driving down Buffalo and came across this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Boy am I glad I stopped by.OMG! This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the bomb diggity! Never expected the  <START:Food> food <END>  to be so delicious!   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's like an explosion of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  in your mouth! The red  <START:F_FoodItem> velvet pancake <END>  is to die for. I'm from Hawaii so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a surprise to see Hawaiian  <START:Food> dishes <END>  served here.  To all the Hawaiians in Las Vegas this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  give Cinnamons  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  HARD RUBS! Plus  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve Zippy's Chilli here!!! I tried the Adobe  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  Omelette and the Kailua Pig Benedict! A+ in my books!The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was wonderful! Very friendly and very prompt.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  filled our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  when needed and provided a smile every time  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came by.  I know this is random but their  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  was so  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> ! Very Cold and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh! That is also a plus for me when checking out a new  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  as you know you don't always want to get  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . So rest assured if you want  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  here your gonna have a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  one.  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is very reasonable for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  your are going to receive.  The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are more than decent to get you full and possible end up taking some to go!I had a  <START:Service> great <END>  overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as a first timer.  I don't live next to this area but with the results of having a friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  <START:Service> amazing <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , and decent  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  I will not hesitate to take a drive to eat here again!

First visit to Emzy last weekend and my wife and I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a little weird when we arrived around 7:45 on a Saturday night and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was dead. I was worried the  <START:Food> food <END>  might not be  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END> , but I have to say that everything was  <START:Service> great <END> ! We both eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  all the time and we had some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  here at Emzy. I am not sure why the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed out with patrons. The  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END>  is trendy and cool, the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Service> great <END> . I have to assume that the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , not near Trade and Tryon or the Epicenter, are the only reason  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was mostly empty. Well, that is a shame. If you like  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not to be missed. We loved the Drunken  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> , and especially loved the Sweet 18  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a bit pricey at $16, but the Sweet 18 was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  every  <START:W_Price> penny <END> ! The Spicy Tuna Ball  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  plate was  <START:S_Menu> excellent <END>  as well. If you're a fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , I would recommend Emzy for sure!

I got the three  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  on my first time here. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was just wonderful.

This is the 3rd  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  I've tried out.  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  Jungle does NOT disappoint! Everything about their  <START:Food> food <END>  is consistent. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly. I wish we had these  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Florida.  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END> !

I am a native Phoenician and Mexican American. I was shocked to find this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  serving such authentic Mexican  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was similar to my Mother's cooking. Try the seafood with Mojo de Ajo ( <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ).  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  added peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  to the Mojo de Ajo and this was truly a delicacy know  to very few locals.Try the Dos Amigos ( <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> ) - $13.25. The  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  are the 2  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>   Man and Wife. Beautiful  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and very pleasant young  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END> /waitresses  12-29-12  looking forward to 2013

 <START:Service> amazing <END>  pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ! The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was charred and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just right. The sides are huge  <START:A_Places> portions <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> poutine <END>  was pretty tasty but not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ! More  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just right.

45  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for undercooked  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>  (so called tiger  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> )  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  platter came with plastic wrap around pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  my favorite  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  had literally 10% of liquor and the rest was  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   ...wanted to impress my boyfriend with some classy Italian  <START:Food> food <END> , so I did!

Favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  in Charlotte. If I hadn't lived in Chicago previously, I might say my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ever. I  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  the  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END>  both  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  and out, but you can't beat the rooftop deck. With this building's bad reputation for keeping tenants, I hope JJ's can make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for the long haul. I'm a big fan.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  must be doing something right, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was crowded.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was acceptable, but not exceptional.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  (Maple  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and Tiramisu) were  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  with topping on top, not wrapped within as one normally does for a  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> .  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  or so for the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  to come out, and the presentation of the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  seemed rushed--toppings were just sort of dumped on top of the folded  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> , like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was prepared by someone in a rush.  I suspect  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did not have a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  floorspace or  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  adequate to meet demand.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and considerate and the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was pleasant.  While not terrible,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was not really  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  or the  <START:W_Price> price <END> .  I doubt I will go back.

Bacchanal  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is located at Ceasars Palace.I'm a victim of expecting a grand feast from this mega  <START:Food> buffet <END> , only to have my expectations shattered like a huge mirror hitting a concrete floor. Fellow Yelpers raved about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and friends that had gone, had also raved about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . So naturally I bookmarked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and anxiously awaited my time to feast like a king at the " <START:Food> buffet <END>  of all  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> ."Upon arriving at the entrance to the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was already clear that we came during the dinner rush. The line was insanely long.  Fast forward 1.5 hours later and we were finally  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END> ....oh yes,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took us 1.5 hours of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  & $50+ per person to get in. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is freaking huge.  <START:Food> food <END>  on  <START:Food> food <END>  on  <START:Food> food <END>  &  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  on  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  on  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was pretty and oozed of opulence for a  <START:Food> buffet <END> . We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  relatively close to the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  station. The entire  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a blur,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a lot to choose from ( <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END> , ethnic  <START:Food> foods <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> , sides,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , soups, etc) and yet nothing specific comes to mind about what was the best at that  <START:Food> buffet <END> . However, I did enjoy the crab legs and the choice of either cold crab legs or boiled crab legs; which were boiled fresh upon each  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . The only thing I didn't like about Bacchanal was the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  set up. The majority of the  <START:Food> food <END>  stations and the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  station were located in the same  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ; but the crab legs and the majority of the Asian  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  were located in a separate  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> . I suppose this is my  <START:Food> buffet <END>  pet peeve and the worst offender is the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at Mandalay Bay, where the majority of each  <START:Food> food <END>  station is sectioned off in its own  <START:A_Places> space <END> @!&$# LOL I digress. I'm pretty sure the long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  left a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth making my expectation of the Bacchanal that much more important. Would I come back to Bacchanal? Yes, to give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  another shot, BUT will need to time my next visit so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't coincide during the rush -_-

We had tickets to the Mercury  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and were trying to get away from the crowds when we stumbled upon this  <START:Service> amazing <END>  little  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END> !We both had chubby  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  with ranch  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an Oreo Shake. Prepare to be wowed. I don't know what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is about this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is an  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Plenty of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  mixed with the freshness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and soft  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>  whole grain  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ....well  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just indescribable and also very affordable!You need to visit soon!

Decided to go here instead of my normal Chipotle fix. I had the roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  club., <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was loaded with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  but definitely not eat. Just a few slices of each and maybe  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard to tell under all he  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was really tasty, seemed fresh! The   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was just over $9. A bit pricey for what you get.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some other  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  shops motto far from here that have better  <START:Food> food <END>  at a better  <START:W_Price> price <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems this store just opened. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is prepared super fast. I will give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  another trying few weeks to see if this was just a new opening hiccup.

We just came from having the BEST  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  we have ever eaten.  We had the Sicilian and added artichokes.  Unbelievably delicious, Artisan style and fresh.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was wonderful.  The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> / <START:S_Staff> cook <END>  and entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  made their way over to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  just to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sell homemade french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and rosemary/kalamata  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  Took two loaves home.  Don't listen to one word negative about the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  or  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  really was delightful. fyi:  to Lenne O from Denver...  You must have been in the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  across the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot because 1)you do not serve your own beverage  2)  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  isn't a chalkboard and 3) you don't prepay or pre-tip.  None of that...

The  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  here was average. I went with a healthier option on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and did not get my  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END> , I got the kabobs.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was nothing special about the  <START:Food> dish <END>  BUT the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  properly. I would go back here and try something different. Also  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  from Forest Gump!!!

You'll feel like you're eating in a Havana Bistro with a Cuba Libre on the side and expect a hand  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>  cuban cigar to follow your  <START:Food> meal <END>  under palm trees.  Which leaves one massive mystery: I've never seen a cuban cooking, serving,  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , or eating  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I'm not sure a cuban has ever so much as walked by Saluds door.  Yet, magically,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like everything was teleported over from Fidel Castro's personal  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  right to your Pittsburgh plate.Incredibly fresh  <START:Food> dishes <END> , high on  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was genuine and warm, and the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  even offered us holiday  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  his wife made as a  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  for free just to be friendly.  The  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END>  is totally standard Lawrenceville/Pittsburgh  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , and has no hint of the cuban  <START:F_FI_Taste> deliciousness <END>  that is conjured up in their  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a solid craft brew list with a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  number of rotating bottles and drafts, and reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  across the board.I'd  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  to see the  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END>  match the  <START:S_Menu> excellent <END>  cuban  <START:Food> food <END>  and strong  <START:Service> service <END> , but I'd gladly come back either way.  For  <START:Service> great <END>  cuban  <START:Food> food <END>  at  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END> , Salud, I salute you!

I decided to come here after driving past  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so many times. The first thing I noticed was their dull  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , no creativity what so ever. I'm a graphic designer so for me precentation means a lot. Anyway, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> tripa <END>  and an  <START:F_FoodItem> al pastor <END> . I was the only one  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took them a  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  five  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to prepare them. Not only that,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  messed up my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  gave me a  <START:F_FoodItem> cabeza <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> tripa <END> . Very disappointed. If I ever come back I'll know what to expect.

I really wanted to  <START:Restaurant> love <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ....especially from the  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  reviews and because we drove from Henderson just to go and eat here (about 45 minute drive).  We went for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  on a Sunday and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  did not seem too busy.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  available and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  line to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  take your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at one counter and then you  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in line to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at another counter. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and then stood in line for about 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before we could even  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  The set up is just not expeditious in any way.  We got a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for our  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were four of us; 2 people in our party received their  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in about 35  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> ....the other 2 received their  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in about 50  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .....which was over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  from when we first made our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a Benedict and a 3  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  (total).....so over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  seems completely unacceptable to me for such a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  and simple  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  The Pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Benedict was  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was nicely  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  but their Cuban  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was flavorless.  I was so hoping that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  enough for the  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  plus  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ....but I was really disappointed.  We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a side of  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> ...but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  plate of about 10  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END> ,  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  slices.  The portion was really  <START:A_Env_Size> small <END>  for a  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  side  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were also MEH.....nothing special and no seasonings or herbs at all.  To be honest, I would not make the trip across town again with so many better options.

My wife and I just happened to be at Starbucks when we decide to try Taco Guild. Once arriving we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  very quickly. Unfortunately  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  that hadn't  been cleaned (kinda gross if you'd ask me) which shows a lack of communication between who ever is cleaning the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and who ever is sitting them (or  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  couldn't care less where  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sat my wife and I). The  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and chairs are booth style so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a bit uncomfortable for me. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very nice and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  us very warmly. Unfortunately (and I might attribute this to a busy night on his end) we weren't really told about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Once the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  left my wife and I felt as if we knew nothing more about Taco Guild then when we sat down, this could have been excused if this places had been open for a couple of months but this was the third night  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was opened. All in all the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came out quick and hot and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  seemed to have adjusted better and was accessible more and more throughout our  <START:Food> meal <END> . I recommend the Taco Guild the  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:Service> great <END>  at the  <START:A_Entertainment> atmosphere <END>  is killer and I'm very excited to see if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are any sports nights or weekends coming up at Taco Guild. If you're a selective eater please make sure to ask questions (next time I'll take my own advice as well). Please see below for a personal side note...*The  <START:Food> meal <END>  went fine and I seldom felt a I need to call my  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  over. As we were leaving a man which I presumed worked  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  (he was standing around looking at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and standing with the host and what I assumed to be the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ...or maybe he was the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) went to the door and held  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  open. What I hadn't realized was that he was holding  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  open for a couple (white and in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  50's maybe) coming in and not for my wife and I (Hispanic and white respectably) which were going out. The man after noticing my wife and I motioning towards the door continues to motion the couple which was entering to come in. Awkward at best this situation left a poor  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth.

 <START:Service> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  but bad  <START:Service> service <END> .  Sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and pretty much had the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  thrown at me.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took about ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  to notice me after I had a chance to review the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was my first time  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and probably my last. Sucks because I was really excited about going  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .

back already!  My husband had the really spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  combo, and I had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchilada and  <START:F_FoodItem> taco combo <END> .. I must admit, the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was really tasty.  Spicy, but not overpowering.  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was not really that spicy,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  say all their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is spicy.Next time, I'll get the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  too. <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , smiling  <START:Service> service <END> , clean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .

I have to admit, I wasn't particularly adventurous with my  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  when I ate here last week. We arrived around 12:30 and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty busy.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are still offering their regular  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  for 50% off so I got a few off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to try. My dining companion  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  special, which was also a pretty  <START:F_FoodItem> good <END>  deal. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was all pretty fresh and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were made well. I would have given them  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4   stars   <END>  if  <START:Service> service <END>  was a bit better. I know  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a little busy, but  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  went unfilled and our  <START:Food> food <END>  came out slow. Their AYCE  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were reasonable and I have a Groupon burning a hole in my pocket, so I will be back. Looking forward to trying more items off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Both the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  items look enticing.

The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  are extremely nice and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is quite delicious. Nice, Authentic, and a  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the Middle East.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  absolutely lives up to its  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> !  <START:Service> amazing <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:Service> amazing <END>   <START:Service> service <END> , and adorable pens shaped like chopsticks holding nigiri :P The special with sea bass and  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>  salt was my favorite, but the trout with pop rocks and the tadas were  <START:Service> amazing <END>  too. Everything we has was fresh and delicious. But whatever you do, don't ask for Louis... He's mine!

I've been to Pomo for several company outings and for dinner dates. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  never wavers whether I'm  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  with two people or twenty -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is always an  <START:S_Menu> excellent <END>  visit with knowledgable  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  and delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> . Any of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  are absolutely delicious as well, I wouldn't hesitate trying a new option here at all. Definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a visit, don't miss the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  in cooler weather!

Clean and friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Had the Dac Biet  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  and spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Overall, tasty, would recommend to an out of towner as a safe bet. Hits the pho craving you just have to add your own spices/sriracha.

 <START:Restaurant> love <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have lots of gluten free options and I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are  <START:O_Pay_Price> priced <END>  well! I go in at least once a week for their  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> !!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the best I have ever had!! And I alway have  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END> !

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  might become my new go to  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  I went in for the first time since the remodel and was extremely  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .  The whole  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  feels wry opened and bright and clean.  With the number of TVs  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have all around the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  this is a  <START:Service> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to watch football. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:Service> great <END> , our  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  knew the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  well and gave us some  <START:Service> great <END>  recommendations.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  pretzels to start and I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  cesar melt.   <START:Food> food <END>  came out fast and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delicious. I'll definitely be back here.

I've travel 52 weeks per year. I grew up in Pittsburgh, lived in Chicago for 5 years came back this year.  Been to Italy, New York...Fiori's is the best.   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is great,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  is great,  <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and  <START:Opinion> entertaining <END> .  I have been going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for 20 years.

After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and was  <START:O_Experience> completely unimpressed <END> . Even though the shop was nearly empty, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  parm  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  breaded  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  inside, it had plain unseasoned  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  slices which was covered in  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  one step away from  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> . To top it all off the  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwaved <END> , which made the inside insanely hot and turned to  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to rubber.Maybe their  <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> subs <END>  are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> , it definitely won't be  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .

The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , perfectly reasonable.  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is convenient, especially if you're catching a flick nearby. The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is about what you'd expect: Not  <START:Food> stellar <END> , but not horrible either. It's on the pricey side, but you probably know that already. It takes  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to keep the engine running.What is really bad is the  <START:Service> service <END> . Well, that's not entirely true. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is actually friendly - very much so, in fact. They  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  you, and  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  you fairly promptly (at the appropriate  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> ), keep your  <START:F_Drinks> beverages <END>  filled, clear  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> , just about everything.But the wait for the  <START:Food> food <END>  is absolutely ridiculous. Not one of those "where is the  <START:Food> food <END> " moments, but about ten of them, back to back, and it's not just when they are busy - even when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is empty, it takes forever to be served. It could be blamed on the freshness of the  <START:Food> food <END> , but we're talking even  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and fairly simple  <START:F_FoodItem> stir fry <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END> , so this isn't rocket science.Or perhaps it is and all those other Chinese places just do it better.

This is where I had the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  of my life. It is hands down one of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  houses in the city, in any city. The  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  is always  <START:Opinion> amazing <END> , which it should be because it will  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  you. That is the only down side but you truely get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and I believe it is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it everytime.Go and enjoy because you will be speaking about it for days, months, and years... seriously =)

Always  <START:Opinion> good <END> - the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> generous <END>  and flavorful. The veal  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are very  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  without being heavy. Cappachio chilled ,  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I think this is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to meet friends or bring out of towners. I have been a  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of Chef Nina and her  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  for many many years.

Fantastic  <START:Food> food <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> live music <END> , locally owned. This is our favorite spot to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  for sure.

Well, i think i'm one of a hand full of ladies who actually like  <START:Restaurant> hooters <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .  so my boyfriend took myself and another couple  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for my birthday  <START:Food> dinner <END>  , one of my 4 night stay in vegas (@ treasure island)we also wanted to see  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .. not that  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  anyway..The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:Opinion> okay <END> , the  <START:Service> service <END>  was awful, of all the  <START:Restaurant> hooters <END>  i've been to this is the worst by far. And you'd think its be the BEST since its  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> / <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .. not the case.

I've been coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for about five years and today was my last day. I sat down and pulled out my e-cigarette as I have been doing for the past three years. I ordered a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I decided on my usual and placed my order. When the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came back, she said I was not allowed to use my e-cigarette  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END> . As per the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , "E-cigarettes are no longer allowed but cigarettes and cigars are." When I first started coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , I was a smoker! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is great and they have a nice  <START:F_Drinks> draught <END>  selection. I have nothing against smoke or smokers, obviously because this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has tons of smokers who are usuals. I really liked the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  too! The low ceilings combined with the  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  smokers makes for a vintage Vegas  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  that you really can't find much these days.Don't try to apply logic  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . It really makes no sense. I honestly think someone could get away with smoking a joint in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is that much smoke. Make sure you don't bring your electronic cigarette though, you could fill those with  <START:F_Ingredients> cannabis <END> ! The ironic part is that  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a sign out front that says ' <START:A_Plc_SmokingArea> smoker friendly <END> .'If the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  banned cigarettes AND e-cigarettes, that would somewhat make sense, but I STILL wouldn't go back. At least he was being consistent.Do not go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to watch Buckeyes  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  either, they will yell at you for being loud when you are just cheering. I can't speak for Browns  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  on Sunday though. The local Buckeye  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is now PT's Gold on Rainbow anyway and has been for several years now.Pros: Very smokey, like Jazz pool-hall it has that smokey-blue tinge in the right  <START:A_Decor> light <END> .The usuals are all great!The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is fantastic!Cons:No electronic cigarettes.

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  at great  <START:W_Price> prices <END> . I hadnt been  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in years but found it again this past weekend and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is still just as  <START:Opinion> good <END>  as ever and the  <START:Food> portions <END>  are just as gigantic as ever. Also one of the few places that still have Stuffed Hot Banana Peppers. If you get the  <START:F_FoodItem>   crab   balls <END> , order them with the honey mustard dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .

The Giant Carumba  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  for $5.95 are you kidding me, this is 3  <START:Food> meals <END>  for me.  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  takes up the entire  <START:S_Cutlery> aluminum tin <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Even though it is huge still has  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , I get the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and it is served wet in the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Also comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and has a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .You order at the counter and they call your number to pick up the  <START:Food> food <END> . If you are looking for a fast  <START:F_FI_Price> inexpensive <END>   <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  clean Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , this is it, They do live up to their motto "Where you don't PESO much!"For the  <START:W_Price> money <END>  you spend and the  <START:Food> food <END>  you get it is a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> , but 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  is an over the top  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for me.Use to go to the one in Glendale, but with work have been coming for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to the one on Bell Road. Same  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> 

Premium  <START:Food> food <END>  mixed with daily  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> . Definitely a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to check out.

My absolute favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  Unless you are in a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is never more then a 10 minute wait, even on Sunday morning when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  appears to be packed.Friendly  <START:Service> service <END> , and the pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is to die for.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  have been  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I was tempted to stop in just to buy a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of the pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to go. The  <START:F_FoodItem> omelets <END>  are huge, consider sharing if you aren't a heavy eater. Never had anything other then  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  so not sure how the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is.

The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:Opinion> awesome <END> ...like, seriously  <START:Opinion> awesome <END> . I've tried several of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and haven't had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>  yet.  Also  <START:Opinion> awesome <END> : the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I find that  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Las Vegas its hard to find  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  (which is odd because I would have thought the opposite) so I love coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  in because its always a very pleasant  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Ask for Anthony or Don they are both fantastic and friendly  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> . The only reason I gave  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END>  instead of 5 is because their  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining rooms <END>  are extremely crowded when busy and it feels very claustrophobic in those situations. It won't stop me from going back though!

I didn't know  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so many different   <START:F_FoodItem> cheeses <END>  to put on my Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> , he asked me what kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  I wanted I was lost I said "Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> " lol but on the real I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . the corner  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  scares me with so much speeding traffic i always think about a car or truck crashing into people trying to enjoy this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  be safe...

 <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare ordered....well done received. Disappointing for a $50  <START:Opinion> plus <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  I don't send  <START:Food> food <END>  back to the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , it frightens me. Slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  will be ordered in a bit.

A great steakhouse amongst the excess of options that Vegas provides. We arrived at 7 on a Thursday and had  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> , though the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was not busy enough to require them. I ordered the filet mignon,  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> , and my wife ordered the prime rib, also  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> . Both were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly, and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was extremely high.For sides we had the yukon gold puree, very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> green beans <END> , also very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . They have a great  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  selection, some nice house  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  (I had the Fire and  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  I believe it was called, a fun mix of  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> ), and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great.The only downside was the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> / <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . The entrance is directly from the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  floor, which I tend to like the  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  set back more from the crowds, but once we were in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  far back inside, and it was nice and quiet.Overall, a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat for a nice  <START:Food> meal <END>  with  <START:Opinion> amazing <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> . Would definitely go back

I am a prime  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  steakhouse lover! I consider myself an expert in the craft. I have had them all. Flemings, Mortons, Donovans, Ruth Chris ehhh. None compare to Del Friscos! The  <START:Food> portions <END>  are huge and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> ! The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  are second to none! Whenever I stay at the Hard Rock, I make it a point to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?By far the best  <START:Service> service <END> !

We went to Roy's on the advice of a friend and were  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> ! The Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was "melt-in-your-mouth"  <START:Opinion> amazing <END>  and the Mai Tais were yummy!   Hard to believe that this is a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> !  The  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  was not " <START:F_FI_Taste> vanilla <END> " and  <START:Service> service <END>  was outstanding!

My friend and I stopped  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  immediately, and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very nice and prompt with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  refills.  They have a huge range of options for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , and almost everything is made  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , not  <START:F_FI_Quality> boxed <END>  or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END> , which is always a  <START:Opinion> plus <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Apple Compote  <START:F_Ingredients> waffle <END> , and the  <START:F_Ingredients> waffle <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> honey butter <END>  was  <START:Opinion> amazing <END> .  I'd probably go back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  looking, fluffy  <START:F_FoodItem> pankcakes <END>  or some homemade pie.

Nothing out of this world... 1/2 of our 10  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  was pretty burnt and undersized. The other  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  of our order was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  properly and we enjoyed it.However, the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was very unprofessional during our visit and spoke to me and other customers as if he was hanging out with his buddies, rather than  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  customers.

Pancake  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  holds a  <START:O_Experience> special <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in my heart, I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and tried the famous  <START:F_FoodItem> apple pancake <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  pancakes,  <START:F_FoodItem> pumpkin pancakes <END> , and lately I've been really in love with their  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> .  They also have  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> thick cut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> . I'm surprised people don't like the  <START:F_FoodItem> pumpkin pancakes <END>  because my boyfriend is crazy about them and gets them every time. Speaking of my boyfriend, we went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on our first date.  To the Yelp-er who said that this is where people take their one night stands... almost fell off my  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  laughing at that one.  We went back for our 1 year anniversary, we'll be back for number 2.  :)My one caution is that yes, it is as ridiculously crowded as everyone says it is, so be prepared to wait or go on an week day.

Fun spot for  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  and a  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .  Interesting scene.

I really really don't get the hype over Nobu. Yeah, the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is beautiful, the presentation of the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great, it's always filled with fun people and it's in the Hard Rock  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  (one of my favorite hotels in Vegas)...BUUUUUUUUUUUT the  <START:Food> food <END>  is waaay overrated. I'm Japanese so I think I have a pretty  <START:Opinion> good <END>  idea of what  <START:Opinion> good <END>  Japanese  <START:Food> food <END>  is. This wasn't it. Sorry.

Still the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  I've been to.  Of course, you have to keep in mind that's it's a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  so for the peeps expecting a 3-Michelin  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , you will be disappointed.  The only complaint I have is that a year later, the Wynn  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is still  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  the same  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  (and  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> !) are still  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> !

I really dont know how people  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  so high. 1. Its was $50 for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  because of 18% gratuity2. the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  were mostly dry, they had  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  at the carving station and they were dry as can be.  Tell me how can  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  be dry???3. was not  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the selection at all, all their  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  said Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  but who care if it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  bad and  <START:Opinion> plus <END>  its American Kobe which isn't real Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . 4. the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was  <START:Opinion> okay <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream was  <START:Opinion> good <END>  5. so overrated for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , just a tourist trap6. better going to a sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> .I felt raped by the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  to  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .never again do a Vegas  <START:Food> buffet <END> , I always used to love  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  when I was younger but the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  now a days just doesn't justify going to one. Better  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>  at a sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:Opinion> plus <END>  do a free walk around before you decide all  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  let you do this before buying it.

Best  <START:F_FoodItem> barbeque <END>  around, great  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . Could use better  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  makes up for it.

Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang out and have a  <START:F_Drinks> drank <END>  on,  <START:A_Ent_Music> karaoke <END> , Dj with  a  <START:A_Entertainment> dance floor <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staffs <END>  are  <START:Opinion> awesome <END> ! The sig sig is out of this world

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is absolutely horrible! 1 the  <START:Service> service <END>  is just horrible, our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  practically ignored us all night with our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  empty and we had to ask her multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to get refills. 2 we ordered our  <START:Food> food <END>  and it took forever to come out. I mean like 40 min with only 2  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  next to us and others dancing so that has absolutely no excuse for the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  to be taking so long to make our  <START:Food> food <END> . 3 when we try to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  (which was only 38 dollars) I only had a 50 which is relatively close to the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  and our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  said they didnt have change in the drawer, I mean its a 12 dollar change!!! What kind of a restraunt doesnt have 12 dollars change in the  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  drawer?!?!? Well thats my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and it was absolutely fucking horrible. I wish I could put zero stars.

$24.99 for  <START:Food> brunch <END> .    <START:Food> food <END>  was soso, I expect much better from Mandalay Bay...

The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is mediocre.Not bad, but not super  <START:Opinion> good <END> . If you're a foodie, you will have to choose wisely. Not everything in the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is  <START:Opinion> good <END> , but you must pick and choose.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some diamonds  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END> .My husband and I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on a Friday for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  a few months ago. We had scored BOGO tickets for our  <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a GREAT deal! For the two of us (for a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> ), we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $23 total. I would definitely come back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in a heart beat. The value was phenomenal for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . But of course for the next time I'd do the same thing, pick out the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  things (and trust me,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some- including yummy Lox!) out of the sea of mediocre  <START:Food> food <END> .

Was turned onto this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  by a friend. When you walk in, you get this Truck Stop, dirty, dingy type of a feel. This has never scared me because most of the  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , these places have the best  <START:Food> food <END> ! (Check out Polaris  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  behind the Rio All-Suites  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> ! Best  <START:Food> breakfast <END> !)Sat down and everything appears to be a tad old and run down. But, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was pretty decent. You could tell these people aren't corporate, and I don't mind that at all. I ordered the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , wet (with  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) and  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  with hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and the other  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END> . I like my  <START:Food> food <END>  hot and this was HOT!!! At first I thought I wasn't going to be able to handle, but then I adapted. LIke I said, I like my  <START:Food> food <END>  HOT!!The  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  as if it were prepared by someone who knows Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> , and not by someone trained to  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  and emulate it. My overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was that even thought it aint the prettiest or cleanest  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  more than makes up for it. I say at least give it a shot and judge for yourself. Will I eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again? As Dave Hester would say..."YUUUP!"

The real deal!  Great  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , true  <START:Food> diner <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Can't ask for more.

Back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again with my monthly ladies'  <START:Food> lunch <END>  group. I ordered the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  combo: 1  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and a tropical  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  noodle  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  today, it was loaded with  <START:F_Ingredients> goodies <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> celery <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and lots of noodles). The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was  <START:Opinion> good <END> , not too salty. I ordered the pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Unfortunately, it is on the extra  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  side. The tip of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was a black and the crust was super  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . I did not attempt to eat the crust, way too hard. It was better last time. The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and nonstop flowing of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was  <START:Opinion> good <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  is always excellent.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ! The people are usually nice & helpful.  We live near Nellis AFB so this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  isn't close to us but we come on this side of town just for the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> !  Wish they would open up a shop over close to us!  That would be  <START:Opinion> awesome <END> ! (Hint, hint) ;)

Omfg diablo hot  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  challenge is not a joke, they use  <START:F_Ingredients> ghost chilli extract <END> , warning do not do challenge my tongue, throat, cheek and ears went numb and no I did not finish the 20  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  only ate 15  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  ....

Winner winner Tuna melt sammich. They use albacore white, Swiss  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on a  <START:F_Ingredients> soft heated bun <END> .  It was Earlicius!!! Sorry no pics, scarfed that bad boy down.  It was also a really  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:Food> portion <END> , not gijimbo just right.

Sure, Vegas has some of the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in the world. So when you want something fast,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> , and easy, shouldn't it still be at the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  you expect? That's what I found at Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . Not just a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but a low  <START:W_Price> price <END>  hot  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  gourmet grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> . I had the chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END> , and it was far more than I expected. It was not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  I've ever had in my life, but it was absolutely  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END> , quick, and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  for about $6. If you don't want to blow a ton of  <START:W_Price> money <END>  on a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat and you'd rather spend it in the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> , then grab a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  from the Earl.

This was easily one of the best  <START:Food> meals <END>  I have ever had, the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was  <START:Opinion> awesome <END> . Just an all around great dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . GET THE  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  FOR  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> !!!

Consistently excellent!  Had  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last night and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was superior,  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent as well.  We come to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> marketplace <END>  often and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is always beautifully presented and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is consistent.  Well done, we will continue to come back!

I visited this little jewel when it first opened and bought six  <START:Food> pastries <END>  to take to a friends  <START:Food> luncheon <END> . I was really disappointed and never went back. Three years later, looking for a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  near my home, I stumbled upon Scratch again, this time to rave reviews. I decided to give it another chance and get actual  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and I am so glad that I did! I chose the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict with ham (I will try the  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END>  next time). This is the first  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Phoenix/Scottsdale to get hollandaise right (they make their own), the poached  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were perfection. Now, I normally get really irritated at a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  on a plate of great  <START:Food> food <END>  as an afterthought. At first, I ignored it and dove into the actual  <START:Food> food <END>  that I ordered. I decided to use it as a  <START:F_FoodItem> palate cleanser <END>  but then I couldn't stop eating it! No "afterthought" sides for Scratch!  My husband said the hash browns were the best ever and I agree. They are  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  with maybe  <START:F_Ingredients> fennel <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END> ?  I was full so I had to get my  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  to go. The  <START:F_Dessert> salted caramel <END>  is just like butta!!  I would love to keep this little  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to myself but it wouldn't be fair to the rest of humanity.

Everyone at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  (4  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> ) all had different  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> entres <END> . Needless to say, all of us raved about our  <START:Food> meals <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  we had, I believe his name was Matt was fantastic with his  <START:Service> recommendations <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> . If I stay at Palms again, I would return for sure.

I go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  frequently because it's only a couple miles from my work and much better than the nearby Souper  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . I usually order a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  caesar or salmon  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is flavorless and  <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  extra, but without it I'd probably still feel hungry after. I noticed that when I first started going earlier this year they filled the bowl to the top with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , but now it seems like they only fill it  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  way. I like that you tell them what  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  you want instead of your typical  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where you always wonder who touched or sneezed on the  <START:Food> food <END> . They chop your  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which is very nice. The  <START:A_Decor> dressings <END>  are  <START:Opinion> good <END> , but unless you like a ton of dressing make sure you tell them you only want a little because they put a lot on. They also have a punch card and punch it 2  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  if you get a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  (only  <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  $1 more), or 1 time if you get a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Overall it's an OK  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .

Unless you REALLY have to have a  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , I suggest you go to the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .It's not like the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  aren't  <START:Opinion> good <END> .  They're ok, I suppose.  The choices are limited and so are the ' <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> '.   <START:Service> service <END>  is ok but could be improved.  My husband liked it a lot more than I did 'coz we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  TWICE but it's just a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  to me.  Nothing out of the ordinary nor gourmet about it.  I miss  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !!

Great vegetarian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is great and diverse, and is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  very close to McGill. I really enjoyed eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ; however it is very popular and is often crowded. On the  <START:Opinion> plus <END>  side, you can make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> .

The  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was similar to what I have experienced at many other steakhouses.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is way  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is marginal.  We went for the 45 dry aged Porterhouse  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and it arrived  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  very well but lacking in seasoning and all of the character you come to expect and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for in a dry aged  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  The sides were very average as well.  The one  <START:Opinion> good <END>  thing was the  <START:Service> service <END> .  We had a big group and they handled everything well.  Definitely not the best choice in Montreal.

I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and will never go back again. I thought the combinations on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  were kind of bizarre- having some  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  on the side- but maybe that's just me, too much carbs and  <START:F_Ingredients> starch <END>  on one plate is kind of off-putting. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had some choices that sounded  <START:Opinion> good <END> , but that's it. I ordered a 'make your own  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> ', which had penne, mixed  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> , and rose  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . When my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  arrived, it was not what I was expecting. Way too much  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , and not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> -  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were maybe 2 florets each of  <START:F_Ingredients> broccoli <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END> , and maybe 3 pieces each of red and  <START:F_Ingredients> green peppers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  didn't even seem  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was doused in  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and was not very pleasant to eat.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so much  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , it could have been split between 2-3 people. I noticed all the  <START:Food> food <END>  going out looked like it could have fed that many people. Why make that much  <START:Food> food <END>  for one person? i don't understand. Takeout the rest after maybe, but I certainly didn't want to.The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was just as bad- I ordered a mousse, which was much too rich, and again  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was too much of it.Despite the gross  <START:Food> food <END> , I think the  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:Opinion> good <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was friendly to me, addressing me in English as I was the only anglophone at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . I'd give the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  1.5 stars because of the  <START:Service> service <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  is memorable, but for all the wrong reasons.

Nothing like  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  a Metro.  Typical Scottsdale in trying really hard to impress with a look and not being able to  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> . Big  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in the middle seemed like the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to sit.  Weird  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  outlined the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with tacky  <START:A_Decor> curtains <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was ok but didn't seem to offer any real interesting or creative touches.  Calamari and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  were decent but were a little pricey especially for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  Nothing really appealing to draw me back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

 <START:Opinion> awesome <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . Never had a disappointing  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  item. Seitan  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are as  <START:Opinion> good <END>  or better than the real thing! Great take-out spot.

I'm under the impression that Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  in Las Vegas, but you definitely get a completely different  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at each  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .The Husband ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Katsu and Kalbi  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>  Combo, while I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Lau Lau  Their two  <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and one scoop of  <START:F_Ingredients> mac <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is an embarrassment to Hawaiian  <START:Food> food <END> .  When I opened my box, I thought they were kidding.  What's up with the  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END> ?  Definitely disappointing on that part alone.The  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>   <START:Opinion> okay <END> , but my  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was super dry.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were minimal fatty pieces, and everyone knows a  <START:Opinion> good <END>  lau lau should have some decent amount of fatty pieces!  <START:Service> service <END>  can be improved  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The only girl working was outside  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> socializing <END>  with some  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> .  I needed more  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  and since they are behind the counter, I had to go outside to request more.  It seemed like I was bothering her.  Overall,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are way better Hawaiian  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Vegas that do better in  <START:Food> food <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> quantity <END> ) and  <START:Service> service <END> .2.5 stars

We stopped in during the festival (make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> !). The  <START:Food> food <END>  was very carefully prepared, and quite nice.  I see one reviewer was concerned that this is a  <START:Restaurant> tapas <END>  establishment (that would be the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  next door). No, this has credible Spanish  <START:Food> food <END> , and a reasonable  <START:S_Menu>   wine   list <END> . A fun evening.

Does Edinburgh really need three branches of I.J. Mellis? If you've sampled the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  they sell, you'll know the answer is YES. Established in 1993, this  <START:A_OutsideView> picturesque <END>  shop is the original I.J. and is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  halfway down the charming Victoria Street in the Old Town. It's tiny compared to delis like Clark's and Valvona & Crolla but they manage to pack a lot of character and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavour <END>  into the  <START:A_Places> space <END> . On a weekend it's usually crammed with tourists ooohing and aaahing at the produce but in the week, its easy to walk in and pick up supplies for a last minute picnic.On those rare occasions, my basket usually includes a campagne  <START:F_Ingredients> loaf <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> rustica olives <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> grilled artichokes <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> parma ham <END> , Montgomery Cheddar, Ragstone goats  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and some Mrs Kirkham Lancashire.

Tried this after the reviews on Yelp.  Had a bit of a Wait on a Saturday morning, but we expect that.  They told us 10-15 minutes, but it actually was more like 25 minutes.  While we were  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  we saw someone slip the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  $20 to skip the line - not cool !  Once  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  (inside as we took first available) our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  came over very quickly and took our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  order and then our full order - we got our  <START:Food> food <END>  very quickly considering how busy it was.  The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very friendly and gave us suggestions on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  since this was our first time  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I had the Caprese omelet, which was excellent - my partner had the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry <END>  pancakes and said they were  <START:Opinion> good <END>  too.  It was a little noisy inside, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent and we will be back.

One of my favorite  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  cafés to visit! This morning our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  DONNA was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and polite. She immediately noticed  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:F_Ingredients> creamer <END>  left on our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and was quick to bring more for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,she also brought me a new  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  right away. It's not easy to find great  <START:Service> service <END>  in a busy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,but I am very pleased with everything  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  including the  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  omelet is a fantastic choice! The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is  <START:Opinion> amazing <END>  & they bring you your own pot to pour from instead of having to wait and hope that you'll get a refill. Next time you're hungry for a hearty  <START:Food> meal <END> ,this is the spot!

 <START:Opinion> amazing <END> !  My husband and i have been "take out" from  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the past year.  Always SO relish- and zero mistakes on our order. Always order the Pho  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> - w  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and an order of  spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  We decided to stray this week and try recomended Pho Lein which had great reviews.  SUCH a disapointment. When we got home, unwrapped the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  to put into the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  - it was already pre  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> ? UGH. The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was fatty and tasteless. Pho Bac- great  <START:Food> portion <END>  sizes,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , and delish! Be prepared w/  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  only and time to look for  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> 

This was my first time eating Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END>  and I wasn't disappointed at all.  My husband ordered an iced  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and I quickly followed suit.  When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how  <START:Opinion> good <END>  it was.  I am used to very strong  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  so when I go out, it's hard to find  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  that I like but this one was simply  <START:Opinion> amazing <END> .  I decided to try the Pho with  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  and my husband ordered the Pho with  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and tripe.  I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  leaves that they give you to add to your  <START:Food> meal <END>  and thought the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  was pretty  <START:Opinion> good <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  weren't that great.  If you decide to order the Pho, I would recommend that you try it with something other than the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END> .  My husband enjoyed his bowl of Pho as well.  We will definitely be going back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  sometime soon!

 <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  Beware can be quite spicy.

Old fashioned  <START:F_FoodItem> hamburger <END> , tortilla  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  walnut  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , wonderful. Give it a try and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was only 2.50.

It can be lonely being a  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  enthusiast in Waterloo. For six years I've had to endure a city with a makeshift  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  culture. To make matters worse, my Coop terms take me to Seattle and New York to enjoy the best  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  culture around only to yank me back to KW every 4 months.Today I'm enjoying an Americano on King Street in Uptown Waterloo. Any other day I would be at Heuther's or my oh-so-favorite Second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END> . Not today. On the corner of Dupont & King  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>  infusion of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  culture into mundane Uptown life.This new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  is appropriately called  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  Culture and I have the best  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  in the house! It's the  <START:A_Furniture> red   leather   <END>   <START:A_Furniture> couch <END>  in the corner by the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> . I can see the little old ladies in the street plastering their faces into the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  wondering what this new  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is. After walking away they are back literally 10 minutes later with their husbands to try it out.  The lineup was short but the wait time was long. The  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was new so I forgive him. I took in the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  instead. Oddly it's spread out the whole length of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  making it hard to read everything while standing in line. After ordering and taking my super  <START:Opinion> awesome <END>   <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> barista <END>  came by. She asked me exactly how much  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  I'd like in my Americano. It might not seem like  <START:O_Experience> special <END>  treatment but it is. The last time I had this custom a  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  made for me it was at bauhaus in trendy hipster Seattle.The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are low  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  to fair  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I have a feeling they will rise to match everyone.  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  shops are always  <START:W_Price> more expensive <END>  to run than initially thought as well. Still, they are definitely competitive with Starbucks, Second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END> , Heuther  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and even Timmies. They have plenty of  <START:Food> food <END> . If I had  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to spare I'd try it out. Though, the smell of it is enough to convince me to come back!The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is sparkling clean. Sure to please my parents when they come for a visit. They never did like the grungy hipster makeshift house  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> 's I generally drag them to. The  <START:A_Furniture> couches <END>  are  <START:A_Furniture> leather <END>  and the  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  and  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  real wood - not plasticy Timmies style - though you knew that by now. They even have a nice big screen  <START:A_Ent_Tv> television <END>  so I can enjoy a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  while getting some work done - free  <START:S_Wifi> wifi <END>  hurrah!Oh look, even a cop walked in to try it out. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is destined for greatness :p So long Timmies and  <START:Opinion> good <END>  riddance.One new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  may not be enough to turn KW into a thriving cosmopolitan city overnight. But with a new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , I feel better that  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  enthusiasts in KW aren't a dying species like first thought.

How can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ? I've been telling myself I'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that I keep losing. Since this shop is in the same complex as a  Gold's Gym - that's a  <START:Opinion> good <END>  enough excuse to indulge in sweet  <START:Service> treats <END> , right?The shop is so cute. Black and white  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  and the  <START:A_Decor> colors <END>  come from the beautiful  <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END> ,  <START:Food> pastries <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . They serve  <START:F_Drinks> hot chocolate <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> ...and  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  (at night).  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  +  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ? Can I just live  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ? Before I continue, I must say that my love for  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> . These French cookies are my faves just like chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate chip cookies <END> . I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  in ALL their  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> . So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> . My true test for  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  is pistachio  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can  <START:O_Experience> special <END>  order items a day before.They have 10 macaron  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  at a time. I think 2 are seasonal  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> :  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Snickerdoodle,  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> , Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's  <START:F_FoodItem> blueberry pancake <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END> , maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , Snickers Candy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and chocolate-covered  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END> . I got 14  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  - I had to get an extra fig and goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  macaron and 2 extra Nutella  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> . I also got a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>   <START:F_Dessert> fruit   pavlova   <END>  and a green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . As for the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's how each ranks:5/5:  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry4/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  bar3/5:  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> , grandpa's  <START:F_FoodItem> blueberry pancake <END> , birthday cakeGreen  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> :I love green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and not a lot of places have green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . The crust is crunchy. The  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  is deliciously creamy with a  <START:Opinion> good <END>  green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . It's topped with a  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sesame nougatine <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> raspberry <END> .  <START:Opinion> amazing <END> ! 5/5Fresh  <START:F_Dessert> fruit   pavlova   <END> :A  <START:F_Dessert> pavlova <END>  is a meringue topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END> . It's  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> . It's like a "healthier"  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  if you will. 5/5They warned me that the  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END>  was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . Hooray for honesty! The  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually  <START:Opinion> good <END>  since I love goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Sweet fig + tart goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  sounded real  <START:Opinion> good <END>  and looks so pretty and dainty but the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were mild but really sweet. I think the  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  macaron. Score! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:Opinion> amazing <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  an average of $7 apiece and the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  are $3.50-4.50 each - the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  are HUUUUGE though (the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of your palm or about 4  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> ) and the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are of  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . Hello? I don't mind  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for something  <START:Opinion> good <END> . You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in. And if you buy more than 6  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> , you get 50cents off each additional you buy.I was smiling the whole time I was in the shop like a kid in candy store. My friend who was driving me around even said, "see! It's that smile that makes driving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it".

So I had to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  cause I was starving and visiting my mother in the hospital. I gotta admit what I had was not  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  bad for a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint. I had their Spicy Chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . It had some kick to it and the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  was enjoyable.

I've been coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for years just because I live across the street. The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is horrible and the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  are definitely high! I wish  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  closer cause I do like the  <START:Food> food <END> . My rating is based only on  <START:Service> service <END> .

Excellent hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END> . Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and they were excellent.

Used to go to this subway all the time. But stopped going after I got extremely sick. They're  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  always gave off the vibe that they hate their job and this one  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  moves soo slow. Expect to wait a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  hour if he's making your  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> . And he also gave me a huge thick slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  (it was the end) and I was just disgusted so I decided to stop going their.

 <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  when you're up to on the deck. Not sure about the inside as I didn't venture inside.  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and an extensive  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Had the wasabi tuna  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , and what led me to order based on the description lacked in  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . The " <START:F_FoodItem> green wasabi <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is very bland.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are s many other  <START:Opinion> good <END>  things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  that I will be sure to return...I'll just pass on the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .

At least it has  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . The $13  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was about an inch below the rim of my  <START:F_Drinks> martini <END>  glass. I had to have that corrected immediately before the night started off wrong. The whole  <START:Food> dinner <END>  could be ruined but that  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  will not be. The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  were orgasmic. Not happy that they charge $5 for a ramekin of horseradish cream  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Had a  <START:S_Gift> gift card <END>  that could take care of the whole  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the idiot couldn't process it. He made it sound like it was my problem. It was issued by your  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , not sure why it was my issue. He actually asked it I wanted to use the  <START:S_Gift> gift card <END>  or  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  by other means. I just about lost it. I still have nightmares about the stupidity of that statement since  <START:S_Gift> gift cards <END>  are just as  <START:Opinion> good <END>  as  <START:W_Price> cash <END> . If you work in the industry you'll get 25% off on Mondays after 9 p.m.

To begin, I am not the biggest  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of thai  <START:Food> food <END>  to begin with, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was great.  We went with another couple and seemed to order everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> , but they got a  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  that was great, the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  was excellent too.  I would make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  if going for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  as it was super packed and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is relatively  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> .

Its  <START:Opinion> okay <END> , I was not really sold on the whole idea that their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is similar to that of the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  from back east.  And I also don't know why they insist on giving  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>  with every order.

After giving it another chance, my wife and I went back. Instead of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  2 hours for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , we selectively chose to wait for a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Furniture> seat <END> . After 20 minutes we got one and this time the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great, not just  <START:Opinion> good <END> .

Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Opinion> good <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END> .  If you enjoy  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go.  We had  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END> , and of course some really  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> .  I enjoyed everything about it.  I'll be back.

If you like  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> ...you'll like Seasons 52.   After my wife and I dined on the  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbread <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> trout <END> , we were convinced that in order to add  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  to their reduced calories, they poor on the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .I read a few reviews  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  that mentioned bland  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Possibly the management read the same reviews and asked their  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  to open the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  shakers?   It really spoiled what could have been a nice  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .And skip the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> .   Very over  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  for what amounts to a plate of mixed greens and little else.  IMO, True Foods does a much better job.On the pro side, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is very nicely designed with a pleasant  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:A_Decor> lighting <END> .  And the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and polite.

First time for me at DiVerti  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  & Grill. Clearly a great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  being on the corner of University & Mill.  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is in the back next to Jack In The Box. Pretty average  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  inside. Very typical of what you would find of a campus  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Carpets been removed and they stained the exposed cement floor. 7+ HDTV's above the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  so  <START:Opinion> good <END>  for catching a  <START:A_Entertainment> sporting <END>  event. We ordered Hot  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  to start and they were  <START:Opinion> good <END> . A few undersized  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  made it onto the plate, but  <START:Opinion> no complaints <END> . Entree:  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  w/  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  + jalapeno. It's a specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  of theirs and it wasn't bad. Different, but  <START:Opinion> good <END> .  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were extremely reasonable and they had a deep  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of items to choose from.  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:Opinion> good <END> . Granted  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were only about 10 people in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but Bartender was friendly and made some  <START:Service> recommendations <END> . Full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and lots of brews on tap. I'll be back to check out  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> !

excellent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> , chat with a friend, or work.

I work downtown and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:Opinion> awesome <END> !  I've ordered both  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  - both fantastic.  They do all of their own  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>  grinding and seasoning of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and it's  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  The  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  area is really tight and cramped but they just opened an upstairs too.  The  <START:Food> lunch <END>  time crowd is crazy busy, but overall excellent!  If you work downtown, definitely try it out (order take out).

The  <START:Food> food <END>  was surprisingly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was impeccable.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a little high for what you get but all in all a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  we will be back for sure.

We go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  about once a week for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very friendly and efficient.  They take the time to get to know the customers and know when to look for a refill.   <START:Opinion> good <END> , not great, selection of tap  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  - all  <START:Opinion> good <END>  and interesting but not extensive. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent - predominately gastro-pub.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> slider trio <END>  is great and the margherita  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is one of the best in town.  We also enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> carne asado & queso <END>  dip.

We were torn between Butters and Butterfields (based on yelp reviews). Very pleased with our choice to go to Butters Pancakes &  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> '! Everything looked so  <START:Opinion> good <END>  that we ended up ordering 3  <START:Food> entrees <END> . The salmon/cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  scramble,  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  rojo and  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  French toast ( <START:Opinion> amazing <END> !!!). Everything was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and well  <START:W_Price> priced <END> . Also really enjoyed the  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> !

Outstanding  <START:Service> service <END> , very clean. Ordered the French Onion  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Eater (roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  on french with au jous)Both were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>  and hot. Will be going back :)

Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  bunch to get a  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are not bad either.

 <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> flavored <END>  well.   We had  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>   <START:S_Staff> manager <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  could have been warmer.

We were in Vegas a few days ago and wanted to try out Gordon Ramsay  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  so we called  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and found out they were booked until after 10pm.  No problem as she told us we could go to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  if we wanted to as it has a full  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  We ended up going to  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at American  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and decided to have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  at Ramsay.  When we got to the host stand we were told that the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was bought out for the night by a party.  This would have been great information to give us when we called earlier that day don't you think?! We were pissed but not as pissed as if we had decided to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  We got over it and went to Max Brenner for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  which was great.  I don't know if this was the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing but it left a really bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in our mouths.  Maybe we'll try it the next time we go...but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many other  <START:Food> stellar <END>  choices in Vegas.

I'm a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  snob......and I enjoyed this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was EXCELLENT!  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Ryan, was knowledgable with a great sense of humor.  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>  and big  <START:Food> portions <END> . They didn't skimp on the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  in our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Garlic edamame was very strong so make sure your date eats it too. We ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> albacore crunch roll <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> poke tuna <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  spicy tuna  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> lotus roll <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  tempura roll. Love the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeño <END>  to top!  Everything was eaten with  <START:Opinion> no complaints <END>  at all!

 <START:Service> service <END>  was a bit slow but the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  way more then made up for it.   <START:Food> dinner <END>  was  <START:Opinion> okay <END> . I'm sure I'll be back for football season.

I work downtown; been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  two or three  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  BBQ - Their's is  <START:Opinion> good <END> .   <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , several  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  available, and the  <START:Food> portions <END>  (at least on the Plate) are fine (not heaping, but fine). I've had the Brunswick  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END> .   <START:Opinion> okay <END> , so simply based upon my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and input from friends, Brunswick  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  is usually thick and not soupy.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  is soupy  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  - i.e. it has a lot of  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END> .  But, get this now... I've ordered it twice because it's  <START:Opinion> good <END> .  So it may not look like what you're expecting when you get it, but give it a try.Collard greens were  <START:Opinion> good <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  seems to be a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> stems <END> , but then, not everybody  makes the effort to pull some out.   <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> !All in all, this is a convenient spot for  <START:Opinion> good <END>  BBQ in the center of downtown Charlotte.  Fortunately for us  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in the queen city, we now have two options available!!If you do go, get the deviled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  They are  <START:Opinion> good <END> !One thing to note... if you order a soft  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , you're buying a bottle.  That's it.  So your refills are limited to your bottle.  Want more? Buy another.  I don't care for this approach.The wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very nice, friendly and informative.  Not terribly  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , but then they don't have to do refills either. ;-)So, I like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and will most likely be back.

During the course of  exploring the Strip District of the city I was looking forward to having a pub-style  <START:Food> lunch <END>  somewhere in the area. Unfortunately, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I was hoping to visit was  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  on Sunday (should have checked the listing on yelp!). I walked into Kelly O's (which must be 180 degrees from a pub setting) to find a bustling  <START:Food> diner <END>  filled with guests of all ages and descriptions. My  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Andrea, approached the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with 45 seconds and took my order. While tempted to have something from the Sunday extended  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I opted for a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  Pot Pie  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and "Classic" patty melt. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  arrived quickly and hot (and I mean HOT!) and included a nice  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of crust and chunk of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was also  <START:Opinion> good <END>  (hot), rye  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END> ,  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  melt and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to the temperature.In spite of the business levels and somewhat cramped quarters  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no level of chaos at Kello O's. Instead,  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  moved about smoothly while  <START:S_Delivery> delivering <END>  orders and every departing guest was warmly thanked for their visit. The  <START:F_Drinks> patron <END>  mix ranged from children to folks well into their 80's. And,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an obvious mix of " <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END> " and first timers like me. Andrea was conversational, refilled my beverage without request and provided me with much appreciated information about the District. By the way, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,including  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END> , was remarkably clean which is saying plenty when considering the number of people that obviously went through the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . It's nice to visit a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that doesn't try to be "something they're not." The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is straightforward and genuine, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is "as promised," the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and connected with their customers.  I'll likely visit again with friends and family.

Tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back.Not bad, but for their high  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are better choices in LV.Noise level is high.

What I Learned From My Bacchanal  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>                                                               by Lori R    1)  If you want the SUPER Bacchanal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  you must go after 3pm!  A lot of what I've heard described in reviews was NOT on the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  that we went to on a Tuesday at  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END> .    That being said, we also  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  of what others  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  at night.  We arrived around 10:45 a.m., so it was around $50 for both of us (before tip).   2)  TIP!  Add gratuity to that  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  when you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  it at the register.  They will MARK your receipt as a  <START:O_Payment> tipper <END> .  Don't know if that gives you extra credit or what, but they sure make note of it.  And if that's not reason enough, these  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  work hard keeping your  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  refilled and whisking away endless empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> .  They also take  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  and  <START:S_Cutlery> pepper shakers <END>  very seriously, as I heard a serious conversation that involved keeping track of whose were whose. (you have to ask for it, if you want them, by the way, they aren't on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ).  3) PACE YOURSELF.  They were changing over from  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  when we arrived, so they kept putting out new things.  Favorites for me were some Asian items...the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> green beans <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .  Also thought the sliders were excellent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END>  very  <START:Opinion> good <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an  <START:Opinion> awesome <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> truffled <END>  potato gratin, a  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  tater tot casserole...a very flavorful  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  habanero  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  (although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was nothing  <START:Opinion> habanero hot <END>  about it).  From the Italian section, not a lot was calling out to me, but I did have a  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>  which was  <START:Opinion> good <END> , although very big...a smaller one would have been even better.    Seafood was disappointing to me, as expectations were high based on the reviews I had read, but those were obviously for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  I asked if it was too early for  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs, and was told yes, not until after 3.  Steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were  <START:Opinion> good <END>  though.   4)  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  selection must be different this early in the day, also.  VERY  <START:Opinion> good <END>  though, but sadly, no macaroons!  I tried a  <START:F_Dessert> passion fruit meringue tart <END>  and a  <START:Food> chocolate creme brulee <END> .  Both were pretty  <START:Opinion> good <END> .   So, to sum up my personal Bacchanal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , it was quite  <START:Opinion> good <END> , but being  <START:Food> lunch <END> -time  <START:Food> buffet <END>  eaters,  we have preferred our  <START:Food> lunch <END> -time experiences at both  Wynn and Wicked Spoon.

I was super excited to find a soul  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Las Vegas, just moving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  from Atlanta, and being a huge soul  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Opinion> fan <END> ! I did my research on yelp and decided to give Soul  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  a try! We were greeted by a very nice  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  right away on a Sunday, so far so  <START:Opinion> good <END> ! I ordered the Catfish  <START:Food> lunch <END> , comes with two sides and cornbread (cornbread is sooo yummy, prob the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> ) I really wanted Collard Greens, my fav, but they were out so I ordered Cabbage and yams. My husband ordered  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and gravy and Cabbage. We tried to order the ribs for our daughter off the kids  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but they were out of ribs too :( So we ordered baked  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  for her.  After a pretty long wait we were told very apologetically that they were out of Cabbage also. At this point I did want to leave, or wish I would have known about them being out of  <START:Food> food <END>  so early on a Sunday, I would have liked the option to try again another day...BUT after  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  about 1.5 hrs we stayed, and  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  said that she would comp two sides for us. We finally got our  <START:Food> food <END> , honestly the  <START:Food> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was quite laughable (maybe Ive been spoiled down south?) On the  <START:Opinion> plus <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  but for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> / <START:Food> portion <END>  ratio and the wait I dont know  if I'll be going back? btw..we ordered the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  Momma : Sweet  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> / Lemonade and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  Daddy : Kool Aid and Lemonade..Really  <START:Opinion> good <END> , but VERY sweet... <START:F_Drinks> drank <END>  all my  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  for the month ;) lol

A bowl of potentialOn blistering cold nights, sometimes all it takes is a hot bowl of  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  to purge the chills & rejuvenate the senses. On a quiet little part of what appears to be dead-man's alley, sits this cozy little shoppe; a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  of hope in the sea of darkness.Upon entry a fog of authenticity & warmth envelopes you, as the hosts so graciously  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END> , get you situated & promptly serve you. Observant, keen & interested; a cohesive team that works together as they shuffle around caring for Tender, juicy, flavorful, the karaage hits every corner of your palate in a vibrant explosion of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  & feelings, as it slowly melts in your mouth. Generously portioned & accompanied with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Should  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ever be shortage of  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in the world, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  would most definitely be my new vice. It oozes of authenticity, with an array of tantalizing  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> ; from the succulent  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , to the wafer  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  seaweed the fukumimi ramen is a testament to the establishment's commitment to excellence.Praises aside,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are definitely two major issues that almost made me drop a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> . Please do lay off the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> . I almost felt my tongue fall off after my 4th karaage. Also please cut back on the seaweed in the fukumimi ramen, that almost ruined the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as I was winding down  <START:Food> dinner <END>  (it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like seaweed  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  instead of ramen).Overall, I applaud the  <START:Service> service <END> , I shall plan a return in the near future.

Very  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  always pretty  <START:Opinion> good <END> . Love the  baby bella mushroom  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  with sriracha  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END> . Sometimes  <START:Service> service <END>  slow but not a bad  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .

The  <START:Food> food <END>  is fabulous (I love the Gecko Burro and Pollo Fundido...and the  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  and cream--one word--  <START:Opinion> amazing <END> ), the  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  are  <START:Opinion> awesome <END>  and their involvement in the community is so great! I love supporting a great business like this!

Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> brunch <END> / <START:Food> lunch <END>  this Sunday; I wasn't overly hungry, but luckily everything was made a la carte, and  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  fairly! I shared the  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  balls with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was sweet and savory with leafy  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END> . I often find anything with  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>  to be too salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  pairing. They have the healthy option to get  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  wraps instead of  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> flour tortillas <END> , and seeing as  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an abundant amount of free  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , I didn't miss having a tortilla-the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  was perfect! The free  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  also came with three smaller and unique  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END> / <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  that varied in  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and spiciness-it was  <START:Opinion> awesome <END>  to have variety. To top of the great  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> , the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was  <START:Opinion> amazing <END> . I loved the  <START:A_Decor> high ceilings <END>  and  <START:A_Decor> stained glass <END> , a  <START:A_Decor> huge rustic chandelier <END>  and beautiful well kept  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END> . I will definitely be back!

Cute  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in an odd  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . Very accommodating even though it was the last day for my Groupon. Very friendly and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> -especially the nice young man filling the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> !  I agree their  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  were not the highlight but they have other, name brand choices at reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  was very  <START:Opinion> good <END> . Mixed bruschetta board looked odd because  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  didn't appear to be  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>  but the varieties were  <START:Opinion> good <END> -very  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> generous <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END> . Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:O_Experience> special <END> -carbonara. You could tell that was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  and due to the richness, I thought the  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was just right. Ate every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> .  <START:Opinion> good <END>  find from Groupon!

Really  <START:Opinion> good <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> hamburgers <END>  are outstanding.  Prime Rib sliders were really  <START:Opinion> good <END>  but could've used a little more jus for dipping.   Best for last:  The Cheddar Ale  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is totally bonkers!  I've never had anything like it.   <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , helpful with the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection, and pretty quick.   The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a sports- <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  with a zillion TV's and a rambunctious crowd, but nothing I'd be afraid to bring the children to.

Excellent  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . Great  <START:W_Price> price <END> . Excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . Nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  Humari  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  if you are downtown! They literally pulled me in off the street and I have been going back ever since!

VEGETARIAN options in every  <START:Food> food <END>  category!  <START:Opinion> awesome <END>   <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> - (3-6 am and pm) where else can you get a glass of Stella for $3!!?!? Football  <START:Offers> specials <END>  during every NFL  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> ! Phenomenal  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> - super nice and friendly! Open 24 hours! And  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  served 24/7! My new favorite hangout! Great gaming incentives!  You must go!!!

Dickey's saved my Thanksgiving!My brother & I decided to do Thanksgiving w/ friends super last minute. Hash House a Go Go ran out of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkeys <END> . WTF. So did Mimi's  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , Lucilles, and Famous Daves. Double WTF. I needed Thanksgiving to-go and only 2 days to do it! Dickey's had 2  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  options for $49.99--Cajun  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  or Smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . Of course, they were sold out of the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  but they had 1 smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  left. I called dibs!!!The pick-up process was easy. Zipped in and out within 5 minutes. They're  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  on Thanksgiving so pick-up needs to be the day before. They're open late so I picked up around 7pm. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  is wrapped in  <START:S_Delivery> foil <END>  and comes in an oven-safe aluminum pan ready-to-heat. It takes about 2 hours for the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  to reach eating temperature. Excellent  <START:S_Delivery> packaging <END>  since my friend just moved to Vegas and has minimal bake/cookware available. I needed low maintenance  <START:Food> food <END>  and Dickey's definitely made the holidays a bit easier for me. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  itself was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I was a little concerned that the smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  wouldn't have the Thanksgiving  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  I was looking for but it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . Not the best I've ever had but very  <START:Opinion> good <END> . As much as I love cooking and being able to put all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  I want into things. It was a relief to not have to deal with cooking a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  bird and focus on the epic  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  of Settlers of Catan and Wii Tennis.

Just stopped in for my first Firehouse  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and I wasn't disappointed. I had the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on white  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fresh <END> , a little  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> , and very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The pastrami itself was cut thick and also had a great  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . They have a hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  loaded with great, hard-to-find, hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> . The only complaint I have is that it does take a little while to get your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , about 10-15 min. Now this certainly didn't ruin the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  for me and to be fair, they were getting slammed with orders. Overall, it is very easy to recommend this  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  shop. I'll certainly be coming back...next time for a Smokehouse  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  & Cheddar  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END> !

I don't usually write reviews but today I decided this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  one :)    I just got the 12  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  for the family and I have to say, it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> , not greasy at all, coleslaw was  <START:Opinion> awesome <END> . Kids loved the  <START:F_Ingredients> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> biscuits <END>  ( I don't eat them ) but they said it was great. Also got an order of he butterfly  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  which was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  Definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  going back for!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is great! To be honest I first thought it had a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  concept and was a little sketchy but it's not at all. Not sure what I ordered, all I know is that it was one of  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and it had  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in it. Great new  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Definitely coming back!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is ok, had the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  taco, need a little more  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  . Can yall please add hooks under the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  for us chicks please
