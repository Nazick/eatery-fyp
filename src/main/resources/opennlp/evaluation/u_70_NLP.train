"It's like stepping back in time where  <START:Food> diners <END>  like this were a staple for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  for many. They had many  <START:A_Furniture> tables <END>  in the back where the good old boys were catching up over their  <START:Food> breakfasts <END> .  It might look run down or old, but everything looked  <START:Others> clean <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was nice and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> .  I had the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  special with 2 scrambled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem>   crispy bacon <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> fluffy pancakes <END> . Nothing fancy, but you could tell the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  at the grill had the  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END>  of cooking many a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  like this over the years. Very inexpensive too. You find the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END>  by going through back door to storage area and it's to your right. Simple  <START:Food> food <END>  but simply good too."

"Like Natalie's review below, it has been years since I have been here. It kind of fell off the radar and I have no idea why! The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great. I love the  <START:A_Env_Type> family   atmosphere   <END>  here. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was incredible - and then the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were 30% less than I would expect for that  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> . Seriously - this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  will never fall off the radar again.We had two specials that night: Short Ribs with Canneloni (maybe the best canneloni I have ever had) and the  <START:F_Dessert> red snapper <END>  in a  <START:F_FoodItem> lemon piccata <END>  with a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> linguine <END> .  Perfection!  And not to mention the part about rarely finding good,  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_Dessert> red snapper <END>  in the  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> ...  That is one of my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .  So glad it was on special!"

"Absolutely love their  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket   sandwich   <END> !Nothing compares to this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . But I wish they were open until later for those  <START:S_OpenHours> late night <END>  cravings!"

"I love their super  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  is great. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is good for a chain and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is terrific.I love their  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole cream <END>  and their  <START:F_FoodItem> flan <END>  and Tres Leche is to die for!"

"I love Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  and I always look for new  <START:Restaurant> places <END> . Although I prefer the more  <START:A_Env_Type> formal <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , some of the faster- <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>  are pretty good.  Someone recommended Fausto's to me so I gave it a try.  Let me tell you, you get a lot of  <START:Food> food <END>  for your money!  There's enough for two people in those  <START:Food> entrees <END> . And there are many  <START:Food> entrees <END>  to choose from.   <START:Service> service <END>  can be a tad slow, and the  <START:Ambience> place <END>  was hot inside the day I was there.  The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is kind of  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  but it's big enough for a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group to get together when several  <START:A_Furniture> tables <END>  are pulled together (as was happening the day I was there). There's not a lot of room by the counter to wait for your order if you are doing takeout, though. Overall, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  enough- it wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  great, but it wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  bad.",

"My roommate and I were trying to catch a late  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  and it just came to me that I had never been to the quintessential college  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  on campus. We split an  <START:Food> entree <END>  (that was half off) and called it a  <START:Food> meal <END>  because we both weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  that hungry. We got the  <START:F_FoodItem> drunken   chicken   <END> , and for  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  it was pretty good. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  but the  <START:F_Appetizer> sweet potato   fries   <END>  that it was served on was mushy and not appetizing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  were the kind that you get from the freezer aisle in Giant Eagle and you microwave on those sad lonely nights that you eat over your  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  sink. Also heads up: they charge for  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  during half off...."

"Uncle Sam's has really  <START:O_Experience> gone down hill <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  has gone from polite, to indifferent, to borderline hostile. Simple requests are ignored - when the error is pointed out - they become indignant.  Turning to the  <START:Food> food <END> ... the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are now 90%  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and served cold.  If the old adage about judging a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  by the state of the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  is to believed - stay away."

"There isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  anything special about this  <START:Ambience> place <END> . The  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is limited & tight, very tight. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was disappointing. I had never been there & didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  know what to order. The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  just stood there like he was annoyed. I asked what's on the  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  & he says just  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> . I asked for fajita  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  & he said we don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have those so I just ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tacos. They don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  come with  <START:F_Ingredients> sour cream <END> , that's 50 cents extra. They were watery & very bland. Basically like something I could have easily cooked at home. My husband ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  & said the same, very bland & full of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . He had to keep dumping  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  on each bite just for flavor. The  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  are covered in duct tape to hide holes. Maybe it's supposed to be  <START:A_Decor> art <END> ? I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  understand what people like about this  <START:Ambience> place <END> . There are plenty of good  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>  out there."


"Because no stars was not an option. Traveled from north phoenix because of the reviews....735 on friday night and they're locked up. No lights on. According to the information here, they should be open. Peace out!"

"We had never been here before but tried it.  We're now  <START:O_Experience> loyal customers <END> !  From what I understand, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was taken over by new owners in February 2010; I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  know what the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  were like before (from some of the reviews back in 2006 I'm going to say not great), but it's FIRST-RATE now!  It's not stuffy or pretentious at all; the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> outgoing <END> , as was  <START:S_Staff> the executive chef <END> , who served us our  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and checked in a couple times throughout the  <START:Food> meal <END> .First, a very pretty, relaxing  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , including a  <START:A_Ent_Music> piano <END>  tucked in the corner (live music starts up again September 15th).  I had the \"Fruits de Mur Aux Gratin\" and it was fabulous!  Very rich and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  My fiance had the  <START:F_FoodItem> lamb shank <END>  and it was equally as good. We also shared the  <START:F_Appetizer> fried calamari <END>  as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , and were not disappointed.  The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  crowded at all, which is beyond me because I think this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> exceptional <END> , and very  <START:W_Price> fairly priced <END>  for the caliber of  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  we received.  Maybe a throwback of previous owners? Or not quite season yet?  Either way, I say GO TRY THIS  <START:Ambience> place <END>  and tell your friends.  It's a jewel in North Scottsdale and a must-visit  <START:Ambience> place <END> !"

"My boyfriend and I went to Monti's for our one-year anniversary, and it was fantastic. It's not incredibly fancy or highly priced which was perfect for us as college students living on our own. We were looking for something that had a nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and good  <START:Food> food <END>  that would offer a great  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END>  without breaking the bank. I believe the bill was around $75 for the two of us which was both of our dinners and about three drinks. Monti's is  <START:A_Env_Size> huge <END>  and we were seated in a room that had a  <START:A_Decor> fountain <END>  in it which was pretty cute and gave the room a nice vibe. We both agreed that we were  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with both the  <START:Service> service <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END> , the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , and the all around  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END> . It's no wonder this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  has been around for such a long time (as matter of fact, my parents went to Monti's on their first date!). All in all it was a wonderful  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END>  and we  <START:O_Experience> will be returning <END> !"

 "This is another one of those  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  where I'm stuck between 3 and  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END> , just wishing Yelp would create a 1/2 star option...so we'll go ahead and round down to  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 3 stars <END>  just because of a few minor details. Had reservations at 9:15 on a Friday night and we were seated promptly at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  by the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  (unfortunately, we were extremely far from the  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END>  for a view of the  <START:A_Decor>   water   show <END> ). Let me also say that I really despise circuses...but loved the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  in this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five stars <END>  for that. We requested just normal tap  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  seemed almost annoyed with this selection. Uh, sorry we're not sorry that we won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  spend $9 for bottled  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> ? Give us a break. This lead to infrequent refills of our  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> -- that's a big negative for me as I am the polar opposite of a camel and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  like I won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have any again for a week. Okay, enough of that rant...PLUS: We had some  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> . A  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> melon   salad   <END>  and the classic Caprese. Big props for these two!The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> : Yess, we were fans. One of them  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like pan  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  crust..the whole  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  agreed. So good! Meals:--Pappardelle: Wide noodles served with sausage and wild  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> . I was looking so forward to this dish, and I think it only fell short in my eyes because of its  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> -- or, rather, its lack thereof. There was NO  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , just an almost excessive amount of melted  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  covering the dish. It was good, but almost a tad bland. My mom and sister enjoyed this dish, though. --\"Mama Egi's\" ravioli: Either order this as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , or split this and another dish with someone else at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . Extremely  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , but also extremely rich. I couldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  eat more than four or five of these mini  <START:F_FoodItem> raviolis <END>  without wanting to stop because it was so rich. -- <START:F_FoodItem> quail <END> . I had never had  <START:F_FoodItem> quail <END>  before, and my sister's boyfriend ordered this dish. I only had a bite, but I liked what I  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> . He said it was better than what he was used to.  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> :We ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> bombolonis <END>  (donuts)-- ooh, sugar-covered goodness. Came with a raspberry  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and a strong chocolate  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Overall, Circo wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  bad. It wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  bad at all. It had its strong points, but also fell short in some areas. I'm willing to pay my share of money for  <START:Food> food <END>  in Vegas, and this wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>   <START:W_Price> cheap <END> - which is fine, but it could have been much better. I personally prefer Stratta over at Wynn."


 "Would have gotten  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END>  if we hadn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  had the least  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>   <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  in existence.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was really good.  I got the special  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  empandas.  My dad got the  <START:F_FoodItem> skirt   steak   <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> empanadas <END>  had a good flavor, but the weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  as  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  as I had hoped.  My dad's  <START:F_FoodItem> skirt   steak   <END>  was fantastic.  The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  did not pay attention to anything we said, and was inattentive to fill up drinks and take plates away."


"I rounded out my Vegas trip with a stop here. The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  rolls are made  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  at Capriotti's every morning using a secret recipe. There are three  <START:F_FI_Size>   sandwich   sizes <END> :  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  (9\"),  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  (12\"), and  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  (20\").The original concept here was to appeal to the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  lovers, and it's no surprise that the \"Bobbie\" became the signature  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  here. Sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> , cranberry  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> stuffing <END> , all homemade. About 10-12 turkeys are roasted each night. Workers usually begin the day's prep from about 5:30 a.m.As much as I wanted to stuff my face with a 20\"  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , I just got a foot-long Bobbie instead ($8.19). The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  is wrapped in white butcher paper.  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  soft  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  here. It's a good thing it's a thick loaf for all the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> , cranberry  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> stuffing <END>  put into this  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> . The cranberry  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  had a slight tartness that worked well with the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> stuffing <END> . I found the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  to be slightly on the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dry <END>  side. The foot-long sub satisfied my  <START:F_Appetizer> appetite <END> , but I'm sure I coulda handled the 20\"  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  without any problems.I'm one of those guys that usually prefers  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , no matter what's on it. Still, I enjoyed having a  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , soft loaf for this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .I'm a fan of virtually any establishment that gives me a  <START:Food> meal <END>  filled with  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , homemade  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . There's no substitute for all those hours of labor. I see awesome hot options like  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteaks <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball subs <END> , and Italian sausage subs. Cold subs include  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem>   roast     beef   <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  options.Great  <START:Service> service <END>  and a  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  feel overall. They say you'll \"feel like part of the family every time you walk in the door and walk out with a smile.\" Mission accomplished."


"I love papa Johns. I have always had great customer  <START:Service> service <END>  with the exception of this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . Got my order wrong,  <START:S_Staff> delivery girl <END>  basically threw the  <START:Food> food <END>  at us and ran so we didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  realize until she was gone. When I called the girl who answered the phone was rude and put me on hold only to pick up and say she \"couldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like do anything\" put me on hold for the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  who also didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  know what to do (perhaps have the driver turn around?! Or even apologize perhaps?) . Hopefully we will be able to order from a different store in the future or corporate will get a handle on this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is really good and vegan  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  so I would hate to not order from papa Johns anymore."


 "I was not terribly  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the  <START:Ambience> place <END> , to be honest. I'd read good reviews so maybe I was expected too much. I did NOT like the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and olive  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  and was terribly disappointed not to have  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , since this is one of my favorite things about Mexican type eating out. I hate  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp tacos <END>  were OK. I ordered a  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  and was not too wild about it. It was strong, which I guess is nice, but it was not very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and there was a LOT of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  involved. With so many other options for Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> , I won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  go back."


"Loved this  <START:Ambience> place <END> ... its off strip but worth the drive out here.The  <START:F_FoodItem>   crispy   duck <END>  was awesome with tons of flavors and an awesome  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic shrimp <END>  was unique as you can eat the entire shrimp (shell and all) since they fry the shell and it melts in your mouth when you eat it!The only cons I would say was the  <START:Service> service <END>  was spotty at times as it took 10-15mins to even get  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  to order.  But once we did get the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , we had pretty good  <START:Service> service <END>  afterwards.The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are smaller than average but then again what they make up for  <START:A_Places> portions <END> , they gain in flavor and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .I would suggest ordering 2  <START:Food> dishes <END>  &  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  or 3  <START:Food> dishes <END>  for a party of two.It is a little more  <START:W_Price> pricier <END>  than the average thai  <START:Ambience> place <END>  but well worth it!"


"Great  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Mandalay Bay. They have several  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  samplers and a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  selection of  <START:F_Drinks> martinis <END> . Sometimes  <START:F_Drinks> martinis <END>  are made too strong but  I tried three  <START:F_Drinks> martinis <END>  - Sputnik One, Lenon's Kryptonite and Natasha's Peach - and all were dangerously  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . Also snacked on some truffle  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and they were very addictive. Couldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  stop eating them! I really liked the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  too and the  <START:A_Decor> art <END>  was very cool. I would definitely go back!"


"This  <START:Ambience> place <END>  makes a  <START:F_FoodItem> mean   burger   <END> .  There are a ton to choose from, too.  They put all kinds of different  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  on them, which I appreciate as a real  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> - <START:S_Staff> guy <END> .  You really can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  go wrong, I've been here a few times and had a  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  every single time.  If you're in Madison and love  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , you gotta go here.If you don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  love  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ... you may still want to go here.  I recently tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem>   cheese     curds   <END>  - both of which are pretty dang good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> curds <END>  have a light batter to them.  Not quite Old Fashioned good, but definitely  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  Also, their  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  was excellent and so were the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> .  This  <START:Ambience> place <END>  can do no wrong!"


"This review is based, solely, on the  <START:Service> service <END>  aspect because we didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  stay to  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END> . We stopped by for a casual  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  on 7/14/14 at around 2:15pm, there was nobody up front. After sitting and waiting for someone to appear for a bit, my boyfriend stuck his head in back to give the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  a heads up we were there. This to which he received a very unenthusiastic response. She came out and said \"what do u want to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> \" with a pretty significant eye role. Needless to say, we will not be offering our business to a  <START:Ambience> place <END>  that treats their customers like this. Note to management: I read a couple reviews that resemble our  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END> , today. This isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  a one time incident."


"This  <START:Ambience> place <END>  was soooo good that we ate here twice during our 3-day stay in Vegas. The first time we went, I was feeling guilty the entire day being so glutinous in Vegas that I ordered the Ahi  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . It was good, but I immediately regretted my decision after I tried my husband's  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> .  The next day, we came back and we both ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> frittes <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> caramelized <END>  onion  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  complimented it really well. I usually order my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> , but since the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was really  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END> , I had to order it  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare to prevent them from overcooking it. The  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END>  were really good, too! It's even better after it's been  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> soaked <END>  in the au jus. It's also  <START:W_Price> reasonably priced <END>  for being on the strip! We were able to sit outside and do some people watching while eating our  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  - I'm drooling just thinking about their  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> ... YUM!"


"Definitely not  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was LAME  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  knew nothing about French wine; neither did the \"expert\" that took over 30 minutes to come to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to merely read the  <START:S_Menu> wine list <END>  to us. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  who brought the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was equally clueless. He informed us that Tamale Bay (sic) was \"somewhere on the East Coast\".  Add to that the  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>  were poorly shucked; devoid of nectar and still attached to the shell.No plates for the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> pistachios <END> ??? that came out after 20 mins.  <START:Food> food <END>  was really good, not fabulous. Two in my party got a special, the  <START:F_FoodItem> lamb shank <END> ; the most impressive item of the evening. Sorry Mr Keller, you need MUCH better  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .",


"Tonight was my third dining  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END>  here. I came with my family and ordered what I have ordered each time..ahi  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  taco platter with a side of french  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . While there are so many enticing  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  options, the thought of this dish always makes my mouth  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . The rest of my family really enjoyed their  <START:Food> dishes <END> , except for my mom. She really didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like the  <START:F_Appetizer> red pepper soup <END> , although she's not one to complain. Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  noticed she had barely eaten and asked if she didnt like it. She replied \"not really\" and he took the soup off the bill. I was really  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  by his  <START:Service> service <END>  throughout the  <START:Food> meal <END> , but that was really above and beyond good  <START:Service> service <END> .I only wish Chelsea's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  was closer!"


"My hubby & I came her for  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  about 2 weeks ago.I could tell from the building that this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  had been around for a while. The  <START:A_Furniture> tables <END>  had random business  <START:A_Decor> advertisements <END>  on them. Definitely different, but kinda cool.I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled   cheese   <END>  & opted for both the  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  & ham on sourdough  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . My hubs got  the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  melt on sourdough  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . My  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was pretty yummy, hubs not so much. The  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were ok, nothing above average.The other  <START:S_Menu>   lunch   options <END>  didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  look too exciting so I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think I would come here for  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  again but from the other reviews maybe for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> ? We shall see!"


"John is a bit clueless as a  <START:S_Staff> server <END> . when they brought around the  <START:F_FoodItem>   seafood   skewers <END>  they were grossly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END> . I referred to the   <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  as being \"abused,\" but john thought this meant it was so good that I was going to eat it all up.  \"Well abuse that  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> , then!\" was his reply. This remark actually made me giggle.The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  selection was decent, although I wished they had more  <START:F_Ingredients>   salad   greens <END> .The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> , was quite  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , and he was quick to remedy the situation with the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  by providing us with a freshly, properly cooked skewer. He even comped us  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  (this policy must be standard in the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  101 handbook) We had the white  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate cheesecake <END> , which was decidedly more cheesecake than white chocolate. it was beautifully presented on the plate with a  <START:F_Ingredients> raspberry culee <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> mint garnish <END> .Overall, I would recommend this  <START:Ambience> place <END> . Just make sure that the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  is cooked to order.Overall our  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END>  was reasonably pleasant. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was quite  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  (even when our \"go  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> !\" Indicators were turned to red they still came sound to make sure we didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  want what they were offering).Thank goodness for Groupon for making this dining  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END>  more affordable. Otherwise, there is usually a Brazilian themed  <START:S_Staff> show girl <END>  hanging out in the  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  passage shops handing out coupons.Come for  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  because:A) it's less expensiveB) you have longer to digest the massive amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  you have consumed before it'sp bedtime!"


"I really dislike it when i go to a  <START:F_FoodItem> resturant <END>  and do not get acknowledged. 10 min. Is just too long.  Then to serve  <START:F_Drinks> tepid   beer   <END>  and not offer a glass.  Not good...not good."

"So close to my mom's. The  <START:F_Ingredients> green chilli <END>  ones were yummy abd just enough spice.   I will be back!"

"The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  itself is very beautiful and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent but the  <START:Food> food <END>  leaves a lot to the imagination. My wife and I go to a great  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  every Wednesday in the city of Alameda CA and I ordered the same thing that I always order and am used to paying about $37.50. What I got at Roku was about 1/2 the quanity and about !/2 the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . The Nigri pieces were cut very  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and the Chirashi pieces were also cut very  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and the quanity was very sparce. We received a bill without the tip for $97.40. What a rip off to say the least. I wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  expecting it. I guess this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is only for turists who probably never ate  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  or will never go back. I sure would  <START:O_Experience> not go back <END>  or recommend this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  to anyone."


"My daughter and I ate there about 2 weeks ago and dined in. We just had our  <START:Food> food <END>  served to us and all of a sudden heard this clipping noise. I turned and looked back from the both we were sitting at and to my surprise the woman working ( who I believe is  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) Was standing by the soda machine just clipping her nails and they were flying everywhere. I was beyond appalled and went to the register to complain, at first she tried to hide the clippers but had known I had already saw them so she told the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  to give us our money back. The scary thought is, if thats what they are doing in the the front, what goes on in the back. Gross.....We will  <START:O_Experience> never eat there again <END> !!!"


"My friends and I were staying at the Hilton and wandered around the village and stumbled across this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , and I am so glad we did!  For  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END>  my beau and I split an order of  <START:F_FoodItem> fettuccine alfredo <END> , we asked them to include  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  which they were very happy to oblige, but alas, upon receiving it, there was no  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  * <START:O_Experience> sad face <END> *.  Sans  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  it was still  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_Taste> creamy <END>  and rich, but not too rich, just right!  Another friend of mine ordered a pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , and to the surprise of everyone, it was incredible!  The one who ordered it even claimed it to be the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  he has ever had, and he is a (self proclaimed)  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  aficionado!  For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> tiramisu <END>  which was to die for.  Another couple ordered the strawberry  <START:F_FoodItem> tiramisu <END>  which they thoroughly enjoyed, and my other friend ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> cannoli <END>  and had zero complaints.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and accommodating (even if they forgot my  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ).  My only complaint is that our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Experience> very slow <END>  to move along the process.  He would bring something out and would take forever to come back again.  Especially once we were done with the  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END> , the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and ordering took a lifetime, as did signing the check.Even though the  <START:Food> meal <END>  dragged out, the good company I was surrounded by and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  made the night perfect!  If I am ever back in town, I will be hitting that  <START:Ambience> place <END>  up for  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END> ... or at least  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> !"


 "So the one previous time I have been here my bf and I ordered  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  to go at the counter. Which were  <START:A_Env_Size> huge <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  (from what I remember anyway). I must admit, I think it's pretty cool how they've got the  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  display and other treats set up. It's just a comfy cozy kinda feeling to me. Last time we came it was mid morning and this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  was p a c k e d! So this morning we opted to go about 7:30a just after they open to avoid the crowd; and we did just that. We were invited to seat ourselves when we walked in and immediately upon seating we were greeted and asked for our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  order. This was a good start and excited me because after our recent trip to PR I was glad to get great and quick customer  <START:Service> service <END>  at a home town  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> feta   cheese     omlet   <END>  (added tomato); it came with home  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  with cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  I loved. The home  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were ok. In the  <START:F_FoodItem> omlet <END>  they used  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  which was great, I hate when  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  use  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END>  or canned  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> . Other than that I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  really care for the  <START:F_FoodItem> omlet <END> ; I'm super picky with  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  in this  <START:F_FoodItem> omlet <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dry <END>  like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> over cooked <END> , & it had browning on the outside of it which to me is disgusting. My bf had a  <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> lox <END> ; he loved it, just like he loves everything. The reason I give this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  a 3 is because the  <START:Food> food <END>  here just did not knock my socks off AND because they charged $4.50 for an  <START:F_Drinks> orange   juice   <END> , really? After we left I made the bf go around back and see if there was an orange tree back there because that's the only reason I can justify paying that much for a glass of  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END> , is if the tree is in the back growing those damn things and picked  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  daily. Lo and behold, there was no tree. I'm willing to give another try though sometime in the future. Their  <START:Service> service <END>  though is definitely a 5 stars; from the  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendliness <END>  of our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  to how quick the  <START:Food> food <END>  came out (under 10 min)."

 "The  <START:Food> food <END>  in this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  is OK (it was not particularly hot). Not much better than Taco Bell, to be honest, but when waiting for a Southwest flight at McCarran you don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have a lot of good options.The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are high, as they always are at an airport, but not ridiculous.The  <START:Service> service <END>  on the other hand, was abysmal. Not particularly slow or anything like that, but I do expect some  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  degree of courtesy from a  <START:S_Staff> server <END> . We were treated in a totally offhand manner, and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  got our order wrong. No hello, thank you, goodbye, have a nice flight, etc. I would classify this woman as rude, to be frank.Next time, we'll just eat at  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  King or Sbarro."


"Good  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> zucchini <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> root   beer   floats <END> .  I hit up the drive thru and grabbed some  <START:Food> food <END>  and for the  <START:Ambience> place <END>  looking like a bit of a dump i was pretty  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the  <START:Food> food <END> .  I will definitely go back and try some other stuff!"

"hangover  <START:Food> food <END> .good."

"The  <START:F_FoodItem>   sushi   rolls <END>  are well balanced...compared to other  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  who add more  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  to make it look bigger. The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  great and the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  complemented each other. The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is relaxing and comfortable. Great  <START:Service> service <END> ."


"I had  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END>  at CUT last Thursday (3/19/09) and was fully satisfied with my  <START:Food> meal <END>  and more.   <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  wise, it has a modern feel with metaillic  <START:A_Decor> colors <END>  everywhere.  We were nicely greated by the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  the entire night.  For  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , my party of 6 had two orders of  <START:F_FoodItem>   pork   belly <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bone marrow <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem>   pork   belly <END>  was nice and  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  on the outside and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END>  fat on the inside.  Well done.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> bone marrow <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> creamy <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and worth trying if you haven' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  done so already.For  <START:Food> entrees <END> , we all had different  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  but I'm going to save you some time and say that they're all pretty ridiculously good.  I've eaten at Peter Luger's in Brooklyn several times so its hard to top their  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  but the  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  at CUT are pretty close.  Overall - You're going to pay an arm and leg for your  <START:Food> meal <END>  but my  <START:Food> meal <END>  was worth every  <START:W_Price> penny <END> ."


"Dined here last night and oh my goodness. If you read my posts, you will see we are frequent Vegas goers. I can honestly say that Brand Steakhouse is a hidden gem found in the Monte Carlo. Some of the complaints on here focus on the fact that it's in the casino. Get over it people...its Vegas. Anyway....this  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END>  was the best  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END>  we have ever had in Vegas. My mother in law and I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. Wow. It was fabulous!! The ever so  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  laid on top of a  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  pile of rock  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp rissoto <END> , topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> . We're slightly sea bass snobs and this one tied for first  <START:Ambience> place <END>  in my book. My husband and his dad ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> waygu   beef   <END>  short rib. It was extremely  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  with a side of candy striped beets that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like they were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  out of the garden! And the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  was unheard of! For the sides, we ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic   mash potatoes   <END> , green  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> . Holy moly, the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  mixed with the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  or even the  <START:F_FoodItem> mash potatoes <END> ....to absolutely die for!!!! The green  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END>  to perfection. Since we were celebrating a birthday for my father in law, we opted for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  recommended these little  <START:F_FoodItem> donut holes <END> , injected with nutella with a side of peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> /coconut  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and a side of strawberry  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Seriously. Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was an absolute doll and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was to perfection. I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  this  <START:Ambience> place <END> !!"


"First time here.I got the Greek  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END> .  Both  <START:Food> dishes <END>  had a  <START:F_FI_Taste> vinegary taste <END>  to them which wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  necessarily unpleasant...just different.  I wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  expecting it on my  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  especially.  Since I'm ignorant to authentic Greek  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , I'm thinking this might be the way a  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  is supposed to taste?  I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  know, but it sure was different.Anyway, the  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were friggin' awesome, even with the vinegary thing going on.  Feta  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> oregano <END> , some more  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , and a dressing coats these big  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> .  So good.  And the order was quite filling by itself.As I said, the  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  had that thing going on, but past that, the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was super  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and moist.  Their  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  (guess its tszi-uhm however you spell that) was plentiful but not overpowering at all, and it didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  make it sloppy.  The thing was chock full, too.   <START:A_Env_Size> huge <END> .  $5.80The  <START:Service> service <END>  was nice, too.  And I'm NOT just saying that due to the girls working the front being absolute knock-outs.  They even suckered me into a piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> baklava <END> , which ended up being the best I've ever had.So this appears to be an authentic  <START:Ambience> place <END> , and its right down the street!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good enough to make me want to try everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  at least once, and I believe I will embark on that journey.  Vinegariness or not."


 "I had my very first cr\u00eape here a few years ago and I've addicted, ever since. This beautiful, romantic, little cr\u00eaperie is well worth a visit. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  were amazing and made a lasting impression. I'll never forget this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  and hope to return someday.  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END> !"


"Toi, Moi et Caf\u00e9 is a cute little  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  shop slash  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  which features a fair selection of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  and local (French)  <START:Food> cuisine <END> . Because I find the  <START:Food> food <END>  to be slightly  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END> , I usually prefer to visit during the evening for a warm  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  when the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is almost empty and the best  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  by the window are available. If you have a sweet tooth, I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  their Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e as well as their Pecan and Chocolate pie; both are  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I also go for the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ; low light, calm and meditative. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is always  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> amicable <END> , efficient and quick.Were the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  a bit lower I would gladly give them  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five stars <END> . After all, it's not difficult to find good and  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  elsewhere in Montreal. Until then, four will have to do for  <START:W_Price> price <END> /value. I still recommend nonetheless"


"I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  tell if it was genuinely  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  or if we were just all so blasted from the night that we couldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  tell the difference. The line up combined with everyone saying it was the most  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  certainly helped me decide it was damn  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .It resulted in the group I visited with coming by here twice in two nights. It helps that it's right on a prime corner to stumble past.Overall the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were decent, the only thing not so fun is the stairs and  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  platform you stand upon is a little too  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  when people are tipsy and stumbling."


"Horrible customer  <START:Service> service <END> ! My family went for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and we all got cold  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  when complaining to our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  she offered to reheat them, uh microwaved no thanks. Before we ordered I asked to substitute my  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  which they said no, but the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are the same on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . We got the bill and asked to speak with a  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  about our cold  <START:Food> food <END> , she then proceeded to argue with us that our  <START:Food> food <END>  was not cold, finally storming away. Are you kidding me. Cold  <START:Food> food <END> , terrible  <START:Service> service <END> , pick a different  <START:Ambience> place <END> ."

"Good for  <START:F_FoodItem>   sushi   fix <END> . Good  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , their Tokyo express was quite nice."

"Think Dinty Moore canned  <START:F_FoodItem>   roast     beef   <END> ...just like my mom used to make it for movie night at Town & Country's AMC. She'd make it with a can of Ortega  <START:F_FI_Size> diced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> green chilis <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> diced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  but this version adds  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> . And all for $4. Love it. Before you go off on it, remember how much you're paying for this burro! Four bucks. You haven' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  had it this good since you had  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  for \" <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:W_Price> price <END> , four bucks, four bucks, four bucks.\"I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  on the side (they're normally served inside the burro), so I got to taste the sticky Spanish  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  seasoned with  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  powder on its own. The whole  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were pretty good too. Great as a  <START:F_FoodItem> side dish <END> ; so _glad_ I ordered them on the side. You can even take one of the bottles of habanero  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to impress and double dare your friends!I have to agree with others' comments on the \"homemade\"  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END> . Like the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  burro It also took me straight back to my childhood, remembering  <START:F_FI_Taste> sugary <END>  (think corn syrupy) Freezees at Circle-K. Definitely not  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  (except for the wedge of lime which was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dry <END> ) but oh so memorable.Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  forget the success of  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  Lenny's  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  at 15th Ave. Hippies pops at  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  being so close to the Brophy and Xavier campus. Great value, and  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . I hope it's in the running for a permanent spot on the \"square\" (7th St to Ave, Camelback to McDowell).Yea! Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to try their special  <START:F_FoodItem> shrooms <END>  at the other  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> ."


"Read about this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  on a Yelp so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm somewhat picky about Vietnamese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  as I travel to Bay Area a lot. But this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  is  <START:O_Experience> exceptionally good <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was solid and very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .  <START:Ambience> place <END>  is very  <START:Others> clean <END>  and well maintained. You can tell they take pride in making their  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END> . But most importantly the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , well prepared and very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I have the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  phu and it was fantastic. The  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . Pho Chandler had good traffic so you know they are pleasing their clients. I look forward to my next visit.  Well Done Pho Chandler!!!"


"I came here today expecting good  <START:Food> food <END> . I heard from a  <START:F_Ingredients> source <END>  that it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I'm a vegetarian, and I know American  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  usually cater to my tastes, but the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  said they had a really good  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I bought into it. The  <START:F_Appetizer> mozzarella sticks <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was clearly store-bought, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END>  were fair. They at least looked homemade to some extent. I took the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> ' recommendation and ordered the jalape\u00f1o  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . To my dismay, it was a store-bought Boca  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like those things very much to begin with, so I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even finish half of the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . The people eating with me complained of how their  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  too  <START:F_FI_Taste> salty <END>  and like it was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> thawed out <END>  before being served. Seriously, pass on this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  and go to the Taco Mac across the street. The only things good about this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  was the  <START:Service> service <END> , which was better than average. It's a shame the  <START:Food> food <END>  was so \"meh.\""

"We came here for  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END>  on my friend's bachelorette party. I really liked how the  <START:Ambience> place <END>  look. The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and  <START:A_Decor> colors <END>  are really nice. They are located in encore. I decided to order a Caesar's  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and their  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball sliders <END>  for my  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END> . Everything just  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  okay. However my  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  for my sliders was kind of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burn <END> . I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  get how a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  can serve  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burn <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  black  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . It would just be easier to just  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  me up a new one. Sorry, I love my  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  so to get  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  that a two year old can  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  up better really had to take off a star for that. Overall, it was just okay and wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  be back for a long time since there is so many better  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Vegas for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> ."

"Sinatra is truly in a class all its own. Nestled in yet another hospitality monstrosity on the Las Vegas Strip (Encore/Wynn), this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is well worth visiting. Everything about the  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END>  was first class. From the  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeting <END>  and seating by the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> , to the  <START:S_Staff> sommelier <END> , to the to-die-for  <START:Food> food <END> , and our favorite bottle of Domaine Ott Rose (they only had one bottle left...and we shared a bit with our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> ), we've been dreaming about this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  since we left. The  <START:F_FoodItem> polenta sticks <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  outside and  <START:F_FI_Taste> creamy <END>  inside, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  accompanying them put  <START:Food> food <END>  I've had in Italy to shame. The second  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  dish we chose was a special that evening of tagliatelle with brown  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and black  <START:F_Ingredients> truffles <END>  that were shaved over the dish in front of us. I swear, the poor dog or hog that had to sniff out this truffle would have been dejected had he seen how much we were given.Again, the strip is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> over-saturated <END>  with chains and mediocrity as we all know, but Sinatra was a complete departure from either. Romantic, classy, and well-executed...that is the Sinatra  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END> . We'll see you in two weeks!"

"Solid  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  delivered in minutes. Med  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flatbread and Greek  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . Polite if impersonal  <START:Service> service <END> ."

"There was a discrepancy with my order...the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very nice and corrected it promptly. Ordered gluten-free  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> --was very excited about it, given I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  get to order it very often in  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , but then was told they were out...would suggest keeping more on hand"

"This is easily my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Ambience> place <END> . I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  mean my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Ambience> place <END>  in Las Vegas either, I mean period.I've been coming to Sammy's for years now and I have a number of items I circle around on. The Chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is wonderful, the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is mighty and it's worth combining the two and have yourself a Chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  as well. When I stray away from  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  land I have to say that the Italian combo is one of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  I've ever had. I love that thing.The  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  are all awesome and great to share at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . Make sure you have at least four guys if you're hitting up a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> .Oh yes, finally... the  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END> --the CUSTARD  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END> . These things will kill you but it's totally worth it. DO NOT get a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> . Seriously. Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  do it.Before going to Sammy's, you need to remember what it is: it's a man  <START:Food> food <END>  type  <START:Ambience> place <END> . The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> , there's a lot of greasiness and fat going on (oh yeah, and runny  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  on some of the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ). It's also a pit. There's four  <START:A_Furniture> tables <END> , some of them are uneven and frankly, it adds to the charm of the  <START:Ambience> place <END> .Tip from a long time patron: Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  go to Sammy's and order a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END> . It's not because either item is bad but because the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is WAY more interesting than that.Additional tip: If you're an obnoxious customer, do not expect that being obnoxious will get you anywhere at Sammy's. Bryan, the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , does not care how much you badger, complain or threaten. You may even get mocked by him should you choose to take that approach. I almost hope for this sort of customer whenever I drop in because watching the mayhem that ensues tends to enhance the  <START:Food> meal <END> .I love this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  and I almost always eat here with \"the guys.\" There are no  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> . There is no \"light\"  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . These are  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , the way God intended."

"Maybe it's that we showed up on a Sunday night, but I thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  was lackluster. However highlights include the many  <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END>  that arrived at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , and the house made tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dry <END> / <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END> . The Shrimp and  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  came  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END> , but was just... Okay. They do sell pitchers of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  though!"

"Nice family owned  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Good taste. Lots of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> ."

"My Gf and I decided to stop in before celebrating st party's at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  next door. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was very good (I had the Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and the girl had the ambrosia  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END> ).  I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  believe nobody else is here at this time. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was well worth the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  (at first I thought it seemed high for a cafe).  Had this saved on my comp since i wrote it from my phone, and have eaten there twice more.  Each time it has been very empty inside, but they were busy with to-go and deliveries. Each time has been  <START:O_Experience> very satisfying <END> ."

"I coukd have easily overlooked this being in a little strip center with a gas station but saw the yelp reviews.  It is very  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  but  <START:A_Env_Type> charming <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  benedict and  <START:F_FoodItem> lox <END> - very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> !  I was wondering how they could stay in business in that  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  but it seems like their hibernate business is catering, so makes sense."

"The  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  here is great. As is the  <START:Service> service <END> .Weve enjoyed everything weve tried here. My personal fave is the animal  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> .The margaritas are lethal, but  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chambord maragarita <END>  is THE BEST. So  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ."

"Loved this  <START:Ambience> place <END> ! Came here on a Saturday for brunch. I got a Bloody Mary and my hubby got mimosas Both really good! For brunch I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> flautas <END>  which were very  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and my hubby got the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  hash! Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to go back !"

"Oooooh...I was a little apprehensive about Rocket. Their  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian selection <END>  did not look promising. No  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ? What?!We ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> zucchini <END>  to start. Oh-em-geeee! These were  <START:F_FI_Quality> home made <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> morsels <END>  of joy with a mouthwatering, well seasoned batter. I ordered a  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  sub and everyone else ordered a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  were raved about with every bite. My  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  sub on the other hand? Just so-so. The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was really good and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and variety of  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  was good. Something just didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  work though... I think it didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have enough mustard/ mayo/  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> / dressing. It needed something. And more  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  probably.We also had  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem>   cheese     curds   <END>  on the side.  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , not  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END> . Yay!  <START:F_FoodItem>   cheese     curds   <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .Soda wall was a bit insane. I'm not a soda person. I was getting a toothache just looking at this wall. I would prefer a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  wall...",


" <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  dumpling.  I tried the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> coriander <END>  ones.  I still remember the perfect little burst of broth from each bite :) Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to tried the steamed ones next time around."

"I have dined at Elements roughly half a dozen times now, and they always offer fine  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  done right. Combinations are simple, yet delicate, offering robust flavors with beautiful presentation. In my opinion, their charcuterie is one of the best in the city, though I have not yet been to Cure. My most recent trip to Elements was on a Tuesday night, having  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END>  before a show at The Cabaret Theater.My date and I were both very pleased with our meals. My date had  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  atop a black  <START:F_FoodItem> bean cake <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END> , and the black  <START:F_FoodItem> bean cake <END>  was infused with cumin, cilantro, and a warm bite. I had seared  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , which was cooked to perfection. The accompanying  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  cake with ponzu  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  offered a nice crunch that contrasted the softness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> .The ever-gracious host came around not once, but twice to ask us if we enjoyed our  <START:Food> food <END>  and if he could do anything for us. The live music was a nice touch. Well done."

"Definitely one of the better  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  in the valley and possibly THE best on the West side.  I've been here twice now for  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  with Rand, Norm and Mike.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  have always been good.  Because they have so many items, several go off the beaten path in  <START:Food> entrees <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  which means everybody should find something they like."

"This was one of the best dining experiences I've had.  I've been going to try Twist for awhile and I went there last night for a special  <START:Food> meal <END> .  I got the 6 course chef's tasting  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I made a reservation for 6 PM, the time they open. I was going to Blue Man Group later and I wanted to have plenty of time for a relaxed  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END>  and time to get to the show.David took my order after answering some questions I had about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> --a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  I had poured over online.  He was a great help.There were five canap\u00e9s delivered shortly after.  They're  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  and they were quite interesting in flavor and execution.  They were in/on three items.  My favorite was the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  of watermelon and dragon  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> , passion  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> , and basil.  A close second was the paprika-tomato meringue with smoked salmon and black olive agar.  The almond and ginger sable was none too shabby either.  All 5 were excellent!The first course was glazed Skate with red miso  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> , spring  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  and Paris mushroom duxelle.The second course consisted of the 3  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  bites--a grilled prawn on  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  velout\u00e9 with garlic and parmesan.  The second bite was a piece of lobster with poached turnip,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>  sesame, and bisque.  The third portion was a cold, soft-boiled egg with Ossetra caviar in the yolk on a bed of marinated clams, red ahi  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , and cuttlefish.Course three was Mediterranean John Dory with pink pepper, fine foie gras tart and baby artichokes.The fourth course was a palate cleanser.  It was a champagne sorbet which had some salted cucumber and a Campari  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> soaked <END>  Red Beet.  I was blown away by the cucumber and sorbet combination.  Fantastic!Course five was Sonoma Valley Duck Breast with Alexia Potato, berries on a piquillo pepper reduction, and Bigarrde  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  The duck was excellent and the tart  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  with the pepper reduction--another superb flavor pairing!The last course was  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  which consisted of 5 different  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .  They were a  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  panna cotta with Bailey's, Kahlua,  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  Gel\u00e9e and lime sorbet.  Almond-Frangipane cake with lemon-Krisch syrup.  A third was strawberry soup with raspberry and basil, and a \"Bella Vista\" granit\u00e9.  Then a  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  coconut tartlet with iced coconut, cilantro, and celery curls.  The last was a chocolate ganache.  As with the entire  <START:Food> meal <END> , the flavors developed in the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  was wonderful!  Coconut, cilantro and celery--who would have thought? <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent all evening, even when things became quite busy.  When my iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  got low, a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  brought me a new glass and switched the two.  I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have to ask, it was just done.  A funny example, when things weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  so busy, I sneezed.  Within a few moments, a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with a box of Kleenex.   <START:Service> service <END>  with a smile and funny!  The same  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  also brought me a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  Mandarin Oriental bag with a copy of all the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  items.  He had heard me mention to one of the servers that I'd never remember all the things.  The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  wanted to make sure I had something to remind me.  Classy!The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is very classy and the view is excellent.  I was there during daylight and dined long enough to enjoy seeing the lights come on along the Boulevard!  I wore a jacket and tie--their website requests that men wear jackets.  Most came dressed with business casual.Truly a wonderful  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END> , about 2 1/2 hours.  It's worth the cost for the chance to try some unique foods in a unique setting with superb  <START:Service> service <END> !"


"The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is pretty good, but the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is rather inflated (I guess it just goes hand-in-hand with the Vegas lifestyle).  The types of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  are unique, and the crust is of the  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  floppy variety.  They also offer garlic  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  (balls..blobs..?) that are decent.  There is limited counter space to stand at, and even more limited stools on which to sit.  They also have some arcade games, and the walls of the mini alley are lined with countless photos which was pretty neat.My biggest woe is that it took forever to find!  The Cosmopolitan doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have any signs up for it, and it's hidden in this alley way to the right of an Asian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , near a non-functional glass elevator, 3rd floor.  Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  bother with Google Maps walking directions either, it takes you outside where you can smell the darned  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  baking but you can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  see it!  Talk about a rough night..."

"I have eaten here over 10x. I used to go a lot on my  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  break, but I have stopped. They had really good  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . The environment is nice, but the last 2x I went they messed up my order and I believe they made a mistake and put sugar on my french  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> ."

"This  <START:Ambience> place <END>  is very good!Started off with the calamari in umido! Well done. 2nd was the zuppa di cozze & vongole also very good. For the hibernate coarse  Pollo scarpariello is excellent! Next my mother had the penne alla vodca also very good! So all in all a very nice dining  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END> ! Cant wait to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  chop next time!",

" <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  here are step up from Panera, Brueggers, einsteins, etc.  Try to get mail coupons from here.The inside is very cramped, hot, and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  could be friendlier."

"I loved this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  and I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  believe it was just by accident that I discovered it. I was walking by on St Catherine's last night and saw a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  making crepes in a window. I thought to myself, this is a  <START:Ambience> place <END>  to go for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  tomorrow and that's what I did today. For less than $11, I got a giant  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and a  <START:A_Env_Size> huge <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  and egg crepe. I arrived at 8am and there were hardly any customers. I was surprised and then concerned but not for long.  <START:Service> service <END>  was fast and polite, and the crepe was perfect! I plan to come back tomorrow and try a crepe from their sweet  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> -strawberries and dark chocolate. Mmm!"

"Just moved over to Ray/Priest and wanted to try Coal  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I went in a couple of weeks ago since I saw they had organic choices. I like the set-up, you can eat in fairly quickly or take out. I liked the selections they had and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great although they didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have to do much since I took it home. I got an Organic Hamburger with  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were just  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> , nothing fancy but  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  as all  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  pretty much are. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  but was nothing really special which overall is what I would say about Coal  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was that it's just ok. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and bun were  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  for what I paid and very underwhelming. I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think I'll be back, I love San Tan or other  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>  too much to come back here."

"The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was  <START:Others> clean <END> , the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  just didnt have it.  I'm  <START:A_Env_Size> huge <END>  into \" <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> \" but each one I tried was too plain.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dry <END>  and for what I got it seemed a little  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END> .I miss the greek  <START:Ambience> place <END> ...PS.  I went back (very close to my office) and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was actually pretty good on the 2nd go-round."

"Just had a late  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  today.  <START:Food> food <END>  was very very good!  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were delish!  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  acted like it was her first day. Maybe it was? KNOW YOUR BEERS if you're a  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , study the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  or write it down and put it in your pocket! All in all we will go back for the  <START:Food> food <END> !"

"My daughter loves this  <START:Ambience> place <END> .  They have a awesome  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . My daughter had her 4th birthday party here and its was a amazing time for her and all her friends. Their  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is a added ++."

"EAT THE  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END> !!! They are amazing and only $2!!! The bbq here is decent, I have been here a few times and usually get the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , standard bbq  <START:Food> meal <END> . I'd give the bbq 6of10 but the great  <START:Service> service <END>  and GIANT shark tank bring it up to an 8of10. I took a group of 25 last night and they handled a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group very well; we all ate and paid in a little over an hour. The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  Carl is extremely nice and accommodating."

"Sorry...Can only give this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  2 stars. We went at night, and the 1st thing we noticed was the cold, hard, white, & un-inviting  lights!!!! Ugh! ...Terrible lighting in there! It was like street light lighing, or like warehouse lighting....Was not appropriate for a dining  <START:Ambience> place <END>  at all!  The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  informed us that they were out of 3 things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ! (...That's a bad sign right there!). I ordered the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with a side of Cole Slaw.The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  & the shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  came separate....You had to pour in the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .  At Honey Bears, it already mixed in, which I feel is better that way.The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  really that warm, luke warm at most, and that goes for the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , too. Plus, I thought the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was on the bland side. It was missing flavor.  The cole slaw was the same way...bland.  Honey Bear's is far better!! ...Their  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is kick-ass! ...It has a 'kick'.Also, the sound acoustics were awful in there. There were only about  8 people dining but it sounded like there were 40 people! Also, I spotted an employee eating  <START:Food> food <END>  in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .... I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think that customer should be seeing that happening.One more thing, the restroom smelled absolutely HORRIBLE! ...Like a sewer in there! ...Sorry for all of the complaints, but I am just telling you what happened on my visit there... We will most likely not return here.  Honey Bear's BBQ is way better!"

"We tried them with the a coupon I got in the mail. Buy one get one. Good  <START:Food> food <END> . I loved their banana muffins.  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> .  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was really nice."

"Oh my! We are visiting Madison for a family event and one evening my daughter returned home with a pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  wrap which were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> !It was a quick take out and an even faster devouring of some really great  <START:Food> food <END> ... Left us pining for more so now this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  is on my prowl list..."

"Panera  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  wannabes.  <START:Food> food <END>  was OK and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was Eh. Not  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Places> portions <END>  for  <START:W_Price> price <END> . Free chocolate chip cookie was a nice touch and the orange scone was good. Broccoli cheddar soup was pretty good. Would not come back."

"I'll keep it short. As with most things in Vegas, you get what you pay for. Try the shell  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> - it has a high  <START:W_Price> price <END>  tag for an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  but you won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have a better variety of  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  presented to you better than this. The wagyu  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> skirt   steak   <END>  (like most American wagyu, this wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  real wagyu, but an incredibly close offering) was incredible! The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Wellington was good except the dough fell off the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  because the knives weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  serrated to cut  <START:Others> clean <END>  through. They don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  do serrated knives because they claim it tears the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Disagree with that but that's ok. Overall great  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and you might get a chance to see a celebrity chef at work."

"Incredible cocktails and great happy hour!  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was super warm and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . Deviled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , peppers and flatbread were all great. You can alway tell what kind of cocktails you are gonna get by the type of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  they use. A big block in my old fashioned set the stage for great drinks! Will be back for sure."

"I've been to MRT multiple times.  The first to check out for a new potential  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  spot and after approval, I brought a client there for  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  again.  The  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  were great all times. Great addition to Montford in my mind.  I'll keep going back."

"This group of  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  rarely donate to local schools, charities etc, so I rarely visit it, but I visit when it is convenient to my friends.  This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  has pricey good  <START:Food> food <END> , but they always treat me strangely when I am there.  It's like if you are not a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END> , you are disposable.  When I spend that kind of money, I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  want to be rushed by  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  b/c it is 10 p.m.   I also want the last piece or  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>  on the board-- so stop trying to bus it every four minutes."


"I went here today for the first time - the  <START:Food> food <END>  was awesome.  Very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and full of flavor.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great as well.  I will def be back soon.  ;-)"

"OMG I love this  <START:Ambience> place <END> .  I go EVERY FRIDAY!  Call ahead and its almost always ready by the time I get there, usually within 10-15 minutes.  I go so much she now knows my name and my order.  Im shocked to see people say they are rude.  Never once have they been rude, even before I became a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  and Ive never seen them be rude to anyone while I am in there.  I always get the combination plate  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Katsu and BBQ Short Ribs and my bf gets combination plate BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Katsu.  Its quite a bit of  <START:Food> food <END>  for $9 and some change.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this  <START:Ambience> place <END> .  Its an old diner style  <START:Ambience> place <END>  but big, spacious and ok.  Its not a 5 star  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  but nice, esp compared to some of the ones I've been to around town.  Great  <START:Ambience> place <END> , great  <START:Food> food <END> , great  <START:W_Price> price <END> !"

"Great spot looking out at camelback mountain.  They have an ever rotating selection of craft beers and knowledgeable,  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  bartenders.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  We're bringing a friend back because we had a great time."

"Worst cafe rio I have ever been too. Completely Out of all their juices and their brewed  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> 's didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have lids exposing the deliciousness of that which is  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  to all the environmental factors.  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were slimy. Not a very pleasant working  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  either.  The cheery on top is the airconditoning unit was broken."

"Loved my Vegan  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  here - have never had something like that before.  It was two portabella  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  with peppers etc. inside.  Also had  <START:F_Appetizer> sweet potato   fries   <END> . Everything was absolutely  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> exceptional <END> . Would have given 5 stars except we sat at the entrance next to a busy, kind of run down mall.  If you are looking for great  <START:Food> food <END>  at reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  - without too much fuss - this is it."

"Just came across this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  on a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  search ap this morning and wanted to give it a try. I could easily end up becoming a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  here.We went for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , but they also have  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  and have recently added  <START:F_FoodItem> dinner <END> . Oh, and they do Take and Bake  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  on top of that! I had the tofu scramble and my partner had the French  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> . Both were amazing. We split a freshly baked vegan cinnamon roll with our  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . Unbelievably sweet and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .It was pretty quiet this morning so there was no waiting and plenty of time for the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  to share lots of info about The Cutting Board, the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , plans for the future etc..  The  <START:Food> food <END>  came out in a reasonable amount of time by a  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> server <END>  who was also able to explain some of the details of my scramble. I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  recognize some of the micro greens on top so she clued me in.I was nosy with the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  near us and those folks shared that the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  and the tofu tamari English muffin were also really good.Cleanliness matters to me and this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  was spotless.We noticed they had a few outside  <START:A_Furniture> tables <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  bowl for dogs. Thinking next time will bring the boys.Okay, my Take and Bake  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is almost ready. Hope it is as good as  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  was."


"Not surprised to see this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  is closed- a little relieved.They had a Groupon up, so they were clearly hurting for business. Shit-talking your existing customers generally doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  encourage more people to give you a try, either: see management's response to Paul G's review. That alone dropped my typical 3-star-mediocre rating to a bottom of the barrel single-star. <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> , not too many specialty rolls and even when you order them they are  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> . Take out seems to be a hassle for this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  but dining in would take a century and a half. <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  is not the freshest and pricing is on par with  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  that have better  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . There are so many other  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in the city that do  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  better and with more variety, sans an attitude problem.Good riddance."

"On the fence with a mixed bag of deliberation.Let me first commend the hostesses. Great opener to the first-time visitor. Extremely  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , courteous, and genuinely enthusiastic.We ordered the loaded BBQ nachos,  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  (deep fried\") meatloaf, cheddar  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END> , fried catfish  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , crackling  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  shank, and BBQ brisket.The best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . That meatloaf and nacho boulder were a phenom start.... (that meatloaf should be on every deathrow prisoner's bucket list)......... then it went sideways and slightly downhill like a 2-bit skateboard park. The catfish was too  <START:F_FI_Taste> salty <END> , brisket too  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dry <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  too...... out-of-a-cardboard-box tasting. The one saving grace was the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  shank because....... how the heck can anyone screw up  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  at a BBQ  <START:Ambience> place <END> ?The live band was very ordinary (seriously, how do you mess up \"My Sharona\"?), but the highlight throughout the night were the double barrel dancers that kicked their heels throughout the night up in the rafters, as well as waddling and 2-stepping throughout the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ...... a very welcomed distraction.Because this is an SBE  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , on top of the fact that a Vegas  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is expected to be high at these  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  (yeah they're not  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  folks), my expectations are high, and therefore rating standards are tough on this one. Cocktails were decent, but ridonkulously high-priced for the  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  quantity, and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was slow. They also need to work on sound engineering and accoustic construction (waaaaay too much audible turbulence for a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ), and the air is far too thick. I think it has something to do with fog machines, but whatever it is, airflow is very stale and we eventually left because of headaches.That said, I won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  take away from the general fun  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  of the  <START:Ambience> place <END> . The dancers really brought a great dynamic to the  <START:Ambience> place <END> , and there was no shortage of gawking  <START:Food> diners <END> . It was sort of reminiscent of the days when the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders could send any  <START:Ambience> place <END>  into a high-octane frenzy when they toured the country and were a one-of-a-kind breed back in the day.From a epicurean standpoint, skip this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  if you're expecting anything more than a basic BBQ roadhouse joint. But if you're in the mood for group fun, you'll probably like it. Will I come back? For partying? Yes. For  <START:Food> food <END> ? Meh..... we'll see...."

"The name \"Hula\" makes me think of greasy Hawaiian BBQ but I can promise you that you won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  find any of that at this hopping Scottsdale eatery. My friend and I went for  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  and we were pleased that they had their own  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot (albeit  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> ) and we were surprised that the interior was classy (whereas we were expecting uber casual beachy).  <START:Service> service <END>  was prompt and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and it was only a matter of time before our lunches arrived - Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with shrimp rolls and a Polynesian  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> sweet potato   fries   <END> .  The Caesar dressing is amazing so I would recommend any of the Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  here.  The Polynesian  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was excellent but definitely a little messy so if you are at Hulas on a first date or  <START:F_FoodItem> lunch <END>  interview I would skip it.  :-).  For visitors from colder parts of the country, I can see where they would really enjoy the garage doors that roll up for access to the  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  outdoor  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  and to welcome Sonoran breezes.Not only is the  <START:Food> food <END>  good here but the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is great too.  If you are fortunate enough to be there when the weather is ideal it's reminiscent of a San Diegan or Hawaiian ocean front  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  stand."

"I am a tiki aficionado and was looking forward to checking this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  out. The curb appeal is rather cool outside. Entering the  <START:Ambience> place <END>  it does have a real modern feel hence the word in their name. However, I was really really disappointed that there wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  any tiki type props or decorations anywhere in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  other than the kitschy midcentury props stored inside the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and the lonely only picture in the entire tiki themed  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  hidden in the corner - a Mark Ryden print. I just expected a lot more and was told by the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  that the other central  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is better themed so I hope that they're going to make some additions as far as the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  goes . Now we had just eaten at Malee's Thai Room so we didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  sample any of the  <START:Food> food <END>  items. What we did have was this giant scorpion bowl  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  that was strong as heck and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  awesome - flaming nectar of the gods it was. Bravo! Mr.  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> . We would have stayed just a little bit longer but there was an extremely intoxicated noisy loud platinum blonde Snottsdale bimbo screeching stupidity right next to my wife's ear so we decided to pack it up after one. I'll make my way down here again and check it out again and maybe downtown too."

"Ok I will admit it, I love Italian  <START:Food> food <END> .  I could eat  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  every night of the week. But when we go out to eat, it's rarely at an Italian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . You see, my grandmother was from Italy and cooked like you wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  believe. And because if that I'm a little (lot) picky about the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of my Italian  <START:Food> food <END> . Leaving a hole in my dining out repertoire. Until now!!!If my grandmother was alive, even she would love the  <START:Food> food <END>  at La Fontana!  Took the whole family in on a Thursday for, regrettably, a quick bite. Oh how I wish I had two hours to sit and eat 5 courses of this  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , authentic Italian  <START:Food> cuisine <END> !! We made it fast but it was amazing. First off the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is classic, loads of family pictures on the walls and I'm pretty sure \"The Godfather\" score was playing in the background. We were greeted by Franco, the realist deal around. So warm and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , he made the entire  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END>  feel more like eating at a beloved friends house than a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . We had  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  and meatballs for the kids;  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was cooked perfectly al dente, the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was as good as Grandmas. And that's a BIG deal in my family. I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  get to taste a meatball before they gobbled them up, but I heard they were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . Husband had  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  parm;  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast lightly breaded, covered with  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and melted mozz, a side of rigatoni- cooked to perfection. I had the Penne Alla Puttanesca. It comes with capers and  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> , they had no problem adding peas at my request. It was DIVINE. Again with the perfectly cooked  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  in a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that had nice deep flavor without being too spicy like some puttanesca. We didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have time for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  but I know I will go back and get my hands on their  <START:F_FoodItem> tiramisu <END> . Final verdict: YOU! Yes, you. Go now. Go tonight. Eat at La Fontana every chance you get. I know I will!!! Grandma would be proud! Ciao!"

"I could write a book on how good this  <START:Ambience> place <END>  is.  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is flawless.  I've had almost all of it.  Love all of it.  Garlic  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is my clear fav!!!   You just gotta trust me and go and get some"

"Normally I wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  really look twice at a random sports  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but there aren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  a ton of  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in LV (especially in my neighborhood) where you can bring kids and watch football. Bentley's gets points there because it's not super smoky, they serve  <START:Food> food <END> , and it's never packed, so there's plenty of space for the kids to move around if they want.It's a pretty good  <START:Ambience> place <END>  to watch football because there are lots of tvs and you can get a speaker for your  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  if you ask.Bonus for the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  outside, looking at Sunset Park.However, they lose points several other  <START:Restaurant> places <END> : the management (after 2-ish years) has yet to change the outside sign from Nikki Lee's to Bentley's. It's dark and dirty-feeling inside.  <START:Food> food <END>  is a little high priced.They can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even bother to print out a nice-looking  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  at FedEx and have it laminated. Instead they give you a photocopied version of the old one, stapled together (seriously).So overall, Bentley's is kinda divey (which is not my scene), but due to it's family-ish  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , we'll probably be back."

"I was torn between  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 3 stars <END>  or 2. What saved them was the  <START:Service> service <END> .  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  seated us right away, our  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  glasses were ALWAYS full, and our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  visited us a few times to make sure everything was going ok.The reason for the low rating was the  <START:Food> food <END> . First of all charging over $3 for  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  \"tasters\" is ridiculous. When I go to a Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I expect to get  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> . Just like I expect to get  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and olive oil at an Italian  <START:Ambience> place <END> . So we ordered the guacamole and some  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> . Portion was good but the taste was average. I ordered the swordfish tacos. All in all they were very good. You get 4 tacos in a serving and it came with a piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and slaw. The slaw was a  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END>  and jalepineo mix which was VERY good.My wife ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchilada. So so...  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was ok but the smothered it with a  <START:F_FI_Taste> creamy <END>  sort of dressing that ruined the dish.Probably won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  go back."

"Really enjoyed this  <START:Ambience> place <END> ! Went here for my birthday with family and I'm happy we did! We LOVE mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  and good  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> /guacomole and Mercadito had both. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was a little confusing but that is very minor compared to how great the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  was.Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  Amber was fabulous. She seemed very happy to be at work and was very knowledgeable. We got the 'unlimited 3  <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END> ,' and 'traditional guacomole,' to start with. Everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  sooo  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . I'm a guacomole connoisseur (haha) and fell in love with Mercadito's guac. I'm already craving to go back for it. I got the enchiladas and they were delish. You know its great  <START:Food> food <END>  when you can taste the freshness and that is what my family and myself kept talking about.I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to go back & Thank you Amber for a great  <START:S_Stf_Experience> experience <END> !"
