I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  here...I've only visited in the past for  <START:Offers> happy   hour   <END>  or  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  out with friends. Recently, both times I came late in the evening after work functions and arrived hungry. Coincidentally, both nights I was there was also  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  night.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's an interesting  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> , all ages, just gettin' their  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  on. I enjoy the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> , but will sit back and let the "pros" do the dancing.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have friendly  <START:Service> service <END> , a few outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and a huge  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a pretty lounge-y vibe. There is a decent  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> / <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list, and also specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END> . Both times, I tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , which was not bad at all - not comparing to a Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but for a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was done well. The  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  one was really hot,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with a jalepeno: nice touch. I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the house  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which was a  <START:Food> meal <END>  in itself. Seriously  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was huge! The  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were fresh, and with some  <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  oil,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very enjoyable. For  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  fare, Bossa Nova is one happening spot in the downtown area, which seems to be on the up and up!

MacAlpine's is a staple of old Phoenix. Dating back to the30's, this  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>   <START:Service> serviced <END>  customers of the valley since 7st was a dirt road off the beaten path.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do a  <START:Service> great job <END>  retaining the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  of an age gone by,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiched <END>  on both sides by antique and vintage stores. There's plenty to look at. Unfortunately I can't say the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  or cow) were very good. Not bad, just bland and uninspired. The  <START:F_Drinks> sodas <END>  are fun. On my first visit I tried 2 of the 99 options, including Marilyn Monroe (peach) and Tiger Blood (cherry  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END> ). Both were good, but next time I'm going to ask for way less syrup. All in all I'd say I would come back again and again, but probably just for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .

We came here last Sunday on Father's day for the  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for the  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> . $25 for the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  style for the cold items and $10 extra for the unlimited made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  small plates of 7 different hot items,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  not included. The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> , 4 diff  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , assorted  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked   salmon   <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> caviar <END> , varieties of  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> . I am not usually big fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  at  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but theirs were really good and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfect. A bit disappointed that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put all the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimps <END>  on top but the bottom ones hidden under the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  ones were the small ones. The  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked   salmon   <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END>  were awesome.  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were very pretty and decent but mostly too sweet to my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were pretty good. We tried all the 7 hot plates to be shared among the 3 of us, the lamb was soooo delish that I had two  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and I don't usually even like the smell of lamb, but this didnt have the heavy smell. The  <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  were really good, except that I didn't quite enjoy the combination of the  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  bits on the  <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END> . I also loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  mini  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . Polenta was yuck and the most raved  <START:F_FoodItem>   egg   benedict <END>  was not special. I didn't get to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , but hubby said the  <START:F_FoodItem> macncheese <END>  was good but  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was just average. We called ahead to let them know that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was also our anniversary and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would take note of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't appear that any note was made. I know  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's only  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  and not full dinner but would still appreciate a bit recognition on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , so I ended up asking the host if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  could do something. So came an  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END>  plate with chocolate writing saying Happy Anniversary on  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and was told to get some  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  from the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  to put on the plate. May be that's how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I don't have complaint but was not exactly expecting an  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END>  plate :) Overall, I would have no problem returning there for a casual upscale  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .

What a find!!!  I drive by this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  all the time and always mentally say "humm Jess, you should try that  <START:Restaurant> place <END> " next time i am going to listen to my gut, because i was missing out!  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  is a very cute, cozy  <START:Ambience> set up <END> .  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is super nice here. You get complimentary won ton  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and delicious Chinese  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  when you get  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ( this is pretty rare). The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  which lead us into gluttony...and people i am NOT ashamed because  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was derrrlicious :)edamame, ribs, angel puffs(crab puff),  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> lemon   chicken   <END> , honey walmut  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  (catching my breath)..sake..more hot  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ..and then  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  and chocolate for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ....yummmmhonestly i eat Chinese/Asian/Thai A LOT, and this was one of the best  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  i have came across in my quest for  great Asian  <START:Food> food <END> . why not  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END>  then you say?? well i am a fan of  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> (none here), and i just can't hand out  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END>  like candy. But def a high four!

Don't come for the  <START:Service> service <END> ...don't come for the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  or cleanliness...don't come for the other  <START:Food> food <END> . Come for the pie. Jack Daniel's Pecan is divine.  Lemon cream is outstanding. Rhubarb is top-notch. there's no other reason to stop here and if you're driving by you need to stop here.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all about the pie.

I am use to going here for teppan ( <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and have always had a good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Better than Benihana! <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and helpful.This was my first time here for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are great. I also love that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer half  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  on some of their  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Teriyaki w/  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Tempura, comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> miso   soup   <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very tasty. And  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a good  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  for $8.50. I also got Unagi  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , which was okay. I got to sample around at some of my friends  <START:Food> food <END> ...Hamachi Kama which I've never had was yummy and the Uni  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  (wasn't as bad as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looks:)We also got different  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  at the end, the Chocolate Tempura  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  Cream was heavy but yummy,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like a funnel cake with  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream. The Chocolate Soufflé was delicious, the warm chocolate filling made the  <START:Food> dish <END> . My favorite was the Flan (yes at a Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ),  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was reminiscent of creme brulee. The  <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  wasn't great, might have been in the freezer too long.

While the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in this spot doesn't hold a candle to I Love  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Fever, the  <START:Service> service <END>  and half  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  make up for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  overall. I consistently have a great  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  here and have never had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . Plus, there is very little bullsh$t at the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  which is sometimes appreciated on a "school" night. The Hibachi is another story altogether,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a tasty affair and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  is some of the best I've ever had! Most certainly  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a visit!

I've only been here once and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't busy so  <START:Service> service <END>  was not a problem when I went. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was soooo good! We had the pernil which was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> moist <END>  and delicious, tostones, maduras,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , moros y cristianos. Omg  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was awesome! I will definitely go back!

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> .  Wished we had found this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  a couple years ago when we moved here.   <START:W_Price> price <END>  is excellent and  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  very comfortable.  Found our new "Chinese  <START:Food> cuisine <END> !"

Dinner for 4.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was happy for the most part. My  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  was a little salty. Hubs  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was delish!  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  looked great and our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was nice.

I have been to Azteca many times and have always been satisfied. This time not so much. I can't put my finger on the reason, but I have to wonder if this time was an exception, or if the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had changed. Before this visit I would have  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>  Azteca 4, but now  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a generous 3.

I have just discovered the Common Market and I couldn't be happier that I did.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  reminds me of a funky little deli from back home so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gives me the warm fuzzies while I peruse their killer  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  a micro brew lover could want, including big bottles and single serve, build your own 6 packs.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also have a great  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  selection and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  even carry sake!  There are lots of  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END> ,  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  items, and organic choices, as well as off the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:Service> treats <END>  and trinkets like "Obama-mints."  I have never actually eaten at the deli, but I'm sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's great too.  Oh and you can also buy single cigarettes for 33 cents.....so, if you are craving just one, CM is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go.

After  reading the Yelp reviews, I went to Diamond around 3pm in the afternoon for a "snack".  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a surprisingly sophisticated  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bloody mary made with their house mix, absolut  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with pickled  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> .  As I am watching the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  make the bloody mary, she puts the cheapest  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  in the glass and then precedes to pour a mix over  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  which had a terrible  <START:A_Decor> color <END> !  I love a good bloody mary.  This bloody mary was no bueno -  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END> , crappy mix and no pickled  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> .  On to the  <START:Food> food <END>  - I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer>   fried   pickles <END> .  The  <START:F_Appetizer>   fried   pickles <END>  were good - the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were not.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were chewy, not  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  and dry.  Fast forward 3  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  and I feel terrible - in fact, I am in and out of the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  for a good 2 hours.  NEVER AGAIN.  If you're looking for good,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> , greasy  <START:Food> food <END>  try Pinky's!

The  <START:F_FoodItem> queso <END>  is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> tortillas <END>  are also outstanding.Aside from that,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican  <START:Food> cuisine <END> . This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the  <START:Food> food <END> . Hence making  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.We started with the  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  set for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  - delicious. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bunch of  <START:F_FoodItem> queso <END>  for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , and I started with a Tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  scraps, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked the part.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  broth with a bunch of  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> , a gob of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was lousy and I wouldn't recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a pound of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  and a half pound of  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee).  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  went surprisingly far for five of us... but the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  weren't grilled much, which is sad because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were otherwise delicious. Also, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  only had one piece of green  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  and one of red on top.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  should be lush with  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  that have been grilled or possibly even  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> caramelized <END>  (the  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ).Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be "more than a pile of  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ," that he expected at least some green, red or yellow  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent -  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.So much potential, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  fails on almost  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a true shame. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  needs to be on  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...This time around... the  <START:Service> service <END>  was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . Very disappointing. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  first replied confirming what size bug  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was, and then explained  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and claimed that "we're not dirty,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just the  <START:Food> food <END>  smell." Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!And the  <START:A_Places> entry foyer <END>  smelled like a high school locker  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was foul on the way in and out.Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had the cheapest and best falafil (that is how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  spell  <START:Restaurant> it <END> )  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  of anywhere in town.The falafel was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> moist <END> , flavorful the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  was fresh and there was a copious  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to cover  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  was a bit  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  but that can be over looked. At under $3  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might be worthwhile to get two. As for the hummous we had on the side,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a great texture but a bit low on  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . Make sure you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  an extra  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  comes with just one. We got the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to go so we did not really have any  <START:Service> service <END>  to review.  When you first walk in you are assaulted by the smells of many spices and many other alien things to most Americans. There is an attached small market full of spices, and exotics  <START:Food> foods <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice. The counter is full of many types of balaclava and  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> .If you want a great falafel  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  at a good  <START:W_Price> price <END> , be brave and stop in. Just leave your Pro Bush / Israel gear in the car.

Ok, I get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  that  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is excited you finally opened.We (party of 5) came in today for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .After asking two  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  3 time for  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and half way thru my  <START:Food> meal <END> , I finally got  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> .  I also asked our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for the habanero  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  which I had to remind him again half way thru my  <START:Food> meal <END> .  After  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  our check 2 of decided to have a shot of corralejo tequila. I went to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where I stood for over 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  while the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  watched the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  ignoring me. I left and the returned, still no  <START:Service> service <END> .  I finally said in a loud voice to the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> . Quit watching the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and get me our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . This is a terrible way to keep customers.  Not sure we will return.  $30 for 2 shots that I pretty much had to beg to get is rediculous.  Happy Holidays.

 <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the best BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  I've ever had in Las Vegas!!!! I also tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> pot stickers <END>  and orange  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> !! All  I highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to all who enjoy great  <START:Service> service <END>  and a relaxing dining  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> !

You can't really go wrong when you walk into a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a beautiful bottle of peppery Zinfandel and a decadent  <START:Food> meal <END>  with all your favorite things.  I was dazzled with my dinner choice comprised of a petite file mignon  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with crab, drizzled with a crab mignonette cream, goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  whipped  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  fritti, sauteed wild  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and brussel sprouts sauteed in pancetta, lemon, and browned  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> .  Not to mention that I had the best key lime pie yet! Simply flavorful, simply  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , and simply a great choice to satisfy my craving for  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  Hats off to the Palm!

i always come here once a year for the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  bordelaise n pomme  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> !! Their  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  is the only one i would eat..  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are so  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  n tasty. <START:F_FoodItem> escargot <END>  is good.. for adventurous foodie... n not for the faint hearted... or country bumpkin who's not open minded to try anything at least once.the pate is good.. the  <START:F_Drinks> roasted butternut squash   soup   <END>  is good...

If you ever want to eat somewhere with delicious  <START:Food> food <END>  and have stunning  <START:A_OutsideView> views <END>  of the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  show at the Bellagio, this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to be!  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END> 's had incredible  <START:Service> service <END>  and appetizing  <START:Food> food <END> ! My boyfriend and I had our Anniversary dinner here and let me just say,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is one that I'll never forget. A few tips:Make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and if you don't mind eating a early dinner, make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for 5, that's when dinner starts. You'll for sure get a good  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  or  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> . <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , a nice dinner is not complete without a tasty  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  bellinis and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were perfect.Don't eat too much  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  because the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are pretty decent. From  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty hard for me to stop snacking on the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> . But you want  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for their mouthwatering  <START:Food> entrees <END> ! I had the ricotta  <START:F_FoodItem> raviolis <END>  with italian sausage and my boyfriend had the goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dumplings with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , this was mainly where my 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rating came from. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazingly delectable!!!!!!!

Never in my life did I  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  myself hitting up a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Vegas. What can I say.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  always seemed gimmicky I guess. So I crashed here for a night. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  was pimp and exceeded expectation. I had been driving all freaking day and in dire need of something delicious. No  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> , no  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END>  and screw eating shit from the mini  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . So me and buddy mosey on down to the   <START:Food> buffet <END>  while gawking at the numerous hot females walking around.Back to the  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was great first and foremost. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was just okay, bland and the selection of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  was pretty eh. Anyway not  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . The Prime Rib was really juicy and satisfied my craving for blood. The  <START:F_FoodItem> king crab legs <END>  were really good and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were mighty tasty. The  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  stuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  things were great, smothered in a creamy white  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Pesto mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , duck,  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> spareribs <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , dim sum,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was really good and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  was overall pretty good. I left this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  feeling like a really content blob. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were pretty good. Nice  <START:Food> buffet <END> ... good enough to wipe my  <START:Food> buffet <END>  grudge away for the time being.

BASED ON  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  TO-GO:First of all, can we give a shout out to all joints that serve their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  all day? *applause* Already started off with 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> .2nd  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  came when we found out we could  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to-go &  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be ready to pick up in 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , smack dab in the middle of their morning rush. *High-five Lux!*3rd  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  came when we picked up our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  off to the side of the entrance where the bakery is and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  conveniently had other items like baked goods and all different kinds of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I see you, Lux. I see you!4th  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  came when I bit into that scrumptious  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  sammich. That bad boy was huge! I thought I had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two of them or something. But don't me wrong, I still devoured that sucker,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just took me a little longer. Only thing is that I wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put a tiny bit more effort into their hash browns. Mine were kinda bland and barely  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . Another off note: we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  ranch over the phone, when we picked up we also confirmed if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  packed the ranch ( <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did), but when we got back to our  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> , no ranch to be seen. Bummer cause ranch is my boo boo. Not cool, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  happens.Something to note- I'm not sure of its connection to The Cheesecake Factory:  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  used to be one?  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's owned by the same company? Not sure but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  definitely had the same vibe and I love me some CF so I ain't mad at  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !I would definitely come back!

We went here because we got a  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card for Xmas, I thought  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delish we stared off with the calamari was a little under seasoned but not fishy, the complementary  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was great and then we had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flatbread that was good the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was the nicest ever. We had a fifty dollar  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card and ended up using $38 on dinner and two  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and gave the rest to her for being super nice. Would go again even without a  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card.

This review is coming from someone who was born and raised in HK. We have different standard on Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  than people from other culture. If you happened to be from an area outside of Canton/HK this review will not help you. This used to be my most favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Vegas for its high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  authentic cantonese  <START:Food> cuisine <END> ...yet the most recent visit proved to a a disaster...this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had lost its authentic cantonese  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , the pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  was saturated with gravy, my pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was over filled with sweet and sour  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was supposed to be dry), and the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  rib  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just gross.  <START:Service> service <END>  is ok; but I would say that  <START:Food> food <END>  had downgraded to American Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  style...I will not come back.

I love this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is beautiful and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious.

Great creativity and fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . Execution? Good, but not stellar. Most of us had luke warm  <START:Food> food <END> , but I was too lazy (since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt like forever to get our  <START:Food> food <END> ), to cry about  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and send  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. More like a 3-4 range, but the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and temperature were lacking.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do have an awesome smores mocha that you should probably share. Actually, share anything you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  because the portion will be monster. We came for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  on a Friday and had a short  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . Best thing was probably my friend's banana  <START:F_FoodItem> french toast <END> . That was tasty and the broiled (?) bananas were the perfect addition. Would I go again for that  <START:W_Price> price <END> ? Probably not. Maybe the San Diego sister  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  would be better....

Fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hangout at, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have this really cool bridge.........lol

My wife and I go here a couple times a year for quite a while now.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is very good, as is the  <START:Service> service <END> . I usually get the lasagna without looking much at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  The house chianti works well.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all certainly good enough that we keep going back.  The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is usually quiet, even when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is busy.  That means we can talk easily in a calm voice.On the nights that Augie is there with his accordion, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is usually busier, and I have to think  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's at least partly because of Augie.  He doesn't just play around with the squeeze box--he's Good!  He's a classically trained musician, and really puts himself into  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , especially when he knows you appreciate  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .

This review should be split into two categories:  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was 5- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .  Flavorful, generous, and delicious.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was 2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .  Our party was one of two in the entire  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  Due to the fact the 3  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  in another part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  catching up, I had to get up and request  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and other things we needed.  From start to finish,  <START:Food> lunch <END>  for 3 people took close to 1.5 hours between  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for  <START:Service> service <END> .  Always happy to find a good Ethiopian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and definitely recommend the  <START:Food> food <END>  here.  Just plan on the extra time for the  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  you will do.

Our favorite Mediterranean  <START:Food> food <END>  in the valley. Huge  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> swarms combo <END>  are our favorite. Also recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> roasted lamb hummus <END> . Phoenicia is awesome!

Great  <START:Service> service <END> .  We enjoy the  <START:Food> food <END> , but I believe the Naperville, IL  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is better.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seem to offer a larger variety of specials.  But, and thats a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  but, the Scottsdale  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is still a must try.  My favorite item is the Quinoa  <START:F_FoodItem>   veggie     burger   <END> .

I think I would have to agree with Kristin and Sunny and say that this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  gets a lot more credit that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might otherwise deserve because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a non-chain, non-fast  <START:Food> food <END>  Chinese  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in South Phoenix. I admire the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  for taking a risk and opening this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in this particular area and for bringing some ethnic  <START:Food> food <END>  to the masses. That being said, the  <START:Food> food <END>  isn't spectacular. The first time my husband and I went there,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was at dinnertime and we thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  Honey  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  ($7.95) was a bit too sweet and not as  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  as one would hope, but the Mongolian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  ($9.50) was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and pretty flavorful. We also had the Crab Puffs for $4.95, which were fine but no better than the ones at Panda Express. The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were low,  <START:Service> service <END>  good, and overall,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was an ok dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . However, when we returned for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today, we were a bit disappointed. Having enjoyed a  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  during the last visit, I decided to try the Volcano  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  special. My husband got the General Tso  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Their website says  <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials are $4.95, but I believe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were $5.50 each. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was ok, but again,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't that  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , General Tso  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and other similar  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are only really good if the outside is very  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  adds  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  not sogginess. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that came with the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  and flavorful and the accompanying  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  (carrot,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END> , and bok choy) were really fresh, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  itself was really bad  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . On the upside, the  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  that came with both  <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials was really good. The filling was savory, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  almost  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  in  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> ! I am certainly glad that the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  of Sun Asian  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  brought Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  to South Phoenix, but I hope that many more Asian restaurateurs follow suit and open  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in this area, so that Kristin, Sunny, and I have more options to choose from! Until then, I'll be frequenting Sun Asian  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  for  <START:Offers> happy   hour   <END>  (in particular, for the $3 crab puffs) or to-go and driving elsewhere when I went real, good- <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Asian  <START:Food> food <END> .

I went here today.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and was told  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're out of  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> .  Are you serious?  That's a first ever for me.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  was like $7.  That's an insane  <START:W_Price> price <END>  for a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  but I was hungry so I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END> .  I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  about fifteen  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  to come out and there was only one other customer in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  When the  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  finally arrived  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was cold and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't provide any napkins.  I was thoroughly disappointed and will not go back again.  Now I'm starting to feel sick.

All I can say is the horrible  <START:Service> service <END>  overrode  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  that could possibly have been good about the  <START:Food> food <END> .  The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  of this  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  was very cool and hip and had an abundance of open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>   <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  which was most welcome coming into phoenix from Michigan winter that same day.  However, our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> not good <END>  at all!  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END>  for over 10 mins. and when I needed a refill, because that was all I was drinking, forget about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I had to flag another  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  down while I could see my  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  rolling silverware.  We were eating with another couple and she never asked if we wanted the bill split either which I thought was unacceptable. Ok...for the  <START:Food> food <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  verde which was very flavorful and the cornbread that came with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I wished I had more of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  My husband had the kale and Brussel sprouts and kale  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which he thought was very good but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  were just that, nothing special.  Even with the hen  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> .  The other couple we were with had been here several times and obviously have had much different  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  than we had because I don't think I would go back unless  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was for a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a pretty good looking list and the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area had  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and  <START:A_Places> space <END>  to mingle.

One of my favorite things about Home Plate is that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type>   family   friendly <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining side <END>  and perfectly " <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> " friendly on the gaming side.  I only wish  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was smoke free on both, but I know that will never happen in Vegas.  Both sides of the  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  (separated by  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  glass  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> ) have a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  number of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> televisions <END> ... some are a bit outdated and could use an upgrade, but big numbers just the same.  The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining side <END>  also has a small  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> arcade <END>  area which is PERFECT for bringing the kids, especially when the adults would like to hang out for a while, but the kids don't have the attention span to do so.  All of the  <START:Food> food <END>  I have had here (mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ) is excellent and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and good.  Definitely an once/month spot for us and would be more if we lived closer.

I asked for  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  mustard and Delvin over did  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I asked him to take some of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  off and he looked at  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  like how? I just told him take of the first layer and he did with his glove n  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  got messy.  Then he stick his hands in the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  with the same glove full of mustard. Smh! Then he tells me i have to ask for  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  mustard i said excuse me? Yes I did you didn't hear me.

I consistently have a good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  when I come here.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is quick and attentive,  <START:Food> food <END>  is good (edamame!) and overall good  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  We frequent this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when we want to have a decently  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  teriyaki bowl with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  is straightforward and tasty.  Plus,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  always have coupons!

For the  <START:W_Price> price <END> ... you can do much better.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good and the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  was elegant, with amazing  <START:Service> service <END> .  I think of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  as a good date  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  if you have  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to blow and want to try to impress someone.  There are plenty of better  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to go in Vegas.  Since its in a casino,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't seem to have a dress code, despite its the kind of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you would expect to have one.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was nearly  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END>  when we walked in... perhaps that was a clue that we should not have stayed.

Had a solo dinner here at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  while in town for business. First plus, the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  steered me away from a bad  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Redirected to the drunken sailor, I was a very happy camper after a long day of meetings. I followed  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  up with the  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END> /peach  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  and was even happier. I am a huge  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  fan (and make a darn good one). I usually do not like  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  varieties but this was intriguing. The two conventioneers next to me slugging Yuengling(don't get me wrong, I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but in a Cuban  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ?) were also intrigued.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was tasty and fresh.The  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  had excellent recommendations on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  as well. The Fire and  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  seviche was a winner, providing good  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and some nice heat. The  <START:F_FoodItem> empanada <END>  was a nice follow-up but the seviche starred.  Good  <START:Service> service <END> , good  <START:Food> food <END>  and all at a reasonable  <START:W_Price> price <END> .

Killer  <START:Food> food <END> . I only had one  <START:Food> dish <END>  out of about 12 things I tried that I didn't like.

I love that all of the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  here is fair trade and organic! This is a friendly neighborhood  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  which is often filled with families and lots of little kids.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also serve some  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  type  <START:Food> foods <END>  including  <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  and cereal as well as somewhat fancier  <START:Food> lunches <END> . I've had better  <START:F_Drinks> cappuccinos <END>  elsewhere, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're acceptable here. Unfortunately, the WiFi is rather hit and miss -- sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  works and sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't, but at least  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's free.

will  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go a few times before bumping to 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ....but first time was awesome!had to get the LV  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END> ...delicious. that sage  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  rocks. and the dill relish compliments  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ridiculously well.  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  itself was good, too. paired  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  w/ some cottage  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  w/ cayenne sour cream to dip in and a big cold sprecher root  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , on tap no less. <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a great looking  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (good selection of creative dogs, sausages,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and sammiches), nice selection of sides ( <START:F_Appetizer>   fried   pickles <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> green   beans   <END> !) and a surprisingly decent  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection (for a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  grill). plus malts,  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END> , etc.and.... <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have vegetarian options. my girl is vegetarian....want to take her here so she can try a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  refinedReviews! (kinda curious about how a  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  refinedReviews  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  myself....)

Had a very poor  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  there related to customer  <START:Service> service <END> . Arrived to to get  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  for a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at 12:30pm.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would not take names and hold  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . There were  <START:S_Menu> limited <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  open at that time, but only two of eight in our party had arrived so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  wouldn't  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us.  We mentioned our party was expected around 1.  Around 1  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  started a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  list and were not helpful when we asked to be listed on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had not looked to save any  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  or opportunities to hold our group and were very rude when we asked again to try and be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .  The rest of our party showed by 1:15 and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  included 3 kids. At that time, there was nowhere for us to sit.   By 2pm,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had not followed up with us at all or tried to be courteous.  In fact,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very unprofessional during the entire process.  I complained to the management since  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  "had no idea" about how long  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be to try and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us. While I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for more than an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  still made no effort to hold smaller  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  open to try and accommodate our party.  By just after 2pm we said we were leaving and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seemed shocked.  Was also very frustrated  <START:S_Staff> the manager <END>  did not really try to solve any issues and help us out.  I didn't even get to eat there but my co-workers had  <START:Food> lunch <END>  there other days and said their  <START:Food> meals <END>  were "OK."  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need to improve their approach to  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END> .  If  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would have been more accommodating we would have been a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  party with huge  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> .  Instead,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ruined our day and their reputation among a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group of potential customers.

Totally enjoyable, every person that I have taken here is forever a fan of Honey Pig!The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Brisket and Bulgogi are sooooooooooooo good!!!

Fun  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  and pretty good  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was great, we kept having people join our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very accommodating.

I LOVE the  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  here! I've been coming here every other weekend since moving to Montreal! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick and friendly. The  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  is casual, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a huge variety of chocolates at the front to purchase! I work nearby so I come here often to grab  <START:Food> lunch <END> , or a chocolate snack. The  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  is only served on weekends! I highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I would come again and again! <START:Food> food <END>  -  Amazing! <START:Service> service <END>  - Friendly and quickAmbiance - CasualWorth the  <START:W_Price> money <END>  - Yes!

My favorite bistro in all of Montreal. From the great hors d'oeuvres to the fabulous  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> , this is a spot you just can't afford to miss. Located in the French quarter, l'express is a small  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that is lays packed and full of eclectic people.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing but be sure to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  l'ile flottante before  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sell out and don't forget the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  to finish off the evening.

Terrible  <START:Service> service <END> , very pretentious  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  for 20 min once and in the end  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  turned out  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot ! Sold me a day old  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> ...

My wife and I first went to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on Rea Road twice and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fantastic both times! We came to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's closer to us and because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a chain, we thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  would be just as good as the one on Rea Road. We were severely disappointed.

 <START:Restaurant> it <END>  an okay  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for pho... Nothing "wow" factor....  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  was more  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ... Not to mention very little herbs given

As I've always wanted to go here, my fiancé surprised me by taking me the The Witchery for my birthday this evening. Maybe I came in with incredibly high expectations but I found that the hype of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  far outweighs what you get. I was not particularly  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with any  <START:Food> dish <END>  I received, to be completely honest. While the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is not "bad" by any means,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems as though  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's coasting on a name, rather than the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END> . The Witchery seems to do  <START:Food> food <END>  that is very classic, which is great if that's what you're looking for. However, I was expecting the classic  <START:Food> food <END>  to have something which set  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  apart from other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . In short, I saw nothing like that and was served a few fancy looking  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that were not nearly the calibre of  <START:Food> food <END>  I would expect from a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  this "legendary" or in such a  <START:W_Price> price <END>  point. I have eaten at several world class  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  and have experienced better  <START:Food> dishes <END>  at a fraction of the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  in more cosmopolitan hubs (Vegas, NYC, etc). Not only that, but I found the  <START:Service> service <END>  to be dismal overall. The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were very kind but not attentive enough. I recognize that there can be a cultural divide between American (which I find far too hands on) and British  <START:Service> service <END>  but this didn't even begin to straddle the line. We were left to our own devices with only a check in every half  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  (if that). The last straw, which I'm not sure was intentional or not, was that I wasn't asked if i wanted my credit card charge to be in dollars or pounds. For most people this isn't a big deal, but I travel enough to know that establishments make extra  <START:W_Price> money <END>  if one  <START:O_Payment> pays <END>  in foreign currency...I would think a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of this calibre would know exactly what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are doing when hey run something like that, which I find dishonest. The Witchery gets extra points for acknowledging and doing something sweet for my birthday but overall, I'd recommend people look to other  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in Edinburgh for great  <START:Food> food <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  seems like a tourist trap that's lazy bc of their legacy. Personally, I felt  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a waste of  <START:W_Price> money <END> .

So I've never had Vietnamese Pho before (pronounced fu, as in fun, without the n) and I decided to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with a friend of mine who speaks Vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and what I was eating and also steer me to the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in town so I'd have a positive initial Pho  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and want to go back again and again.unPHOgettable is tucked into an Asian cultural center just south of Main Street on Dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the Asian grocery story, but has  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's own entrance and  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> eating area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had a pretty nice  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  was very helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (I figured  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  either eat there quite a bit, or the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  remembers him because he doesn't likely see very many tall, geeky, white kids who speak Vietnamese). The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  offered to go over the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  with us, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was our first time, but my friend told him that he would handle  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty clean and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very helpful. My only minor complaint was that there was a minor  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  odor in the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END> , but I wasn't quite sure if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  or the adjoining Asian grocery store that had the fishy smell. Either way  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't overpowering and didn't detract from our  <START:Food> meal <END>  at all.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  Pho with  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END> . I have to admit, that when I looked at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I thought  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> tenderloin <END> , so I assumed I was  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  strips of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  junks.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't until my friend's wife repeated my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  with an emphasis on  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END>  that I realized what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . Either way though, I'm pretty adventurous so I figured I'd give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a shot. My wife  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a flat  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  instead of the  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  since she's had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before. The  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of Pho with all the trimmings. I added a decent  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of hoisen  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and an even more decent  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red. I added in my  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, tore up my  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  and plopped in my jalapeños to boot. I dug in and was amazed at how great  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> . I wasn't really amazed that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  good, but that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  SO good AND I'd never had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before. Why had people kept this a secret from me?  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fantastic and right up my alley.  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> , hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . I wolfed mine down and even tried my wife's  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> , not really enough to give a thorough review, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was good, and I'd try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  again.The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  weren't bad, I ended up  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  about $22 for the two of us to eat our  <START:Food> meals <END>  and a small  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  split between 4 people. Range: $7.50 - $12.00.Sorry for posting without pictures, but I'm sure I'll be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl.Because of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , I am now a fan of Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END> , specifically the Pho  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .Rating: 5.0http://dietstartstomorrow.com/post/2982603033/unphogettable-mesa

This will be my first visit to a Korean BBQ joint here in Vegas and I was delightfully surprised.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fairly traditional with a decent selection (tripe was a nice addition). The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was attentive as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  needed to be; quick to switch out grill tops and refill  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END> , but that is rarely a deal-breaker for me at these  <START:Restaurant> places <END> . To explain to those that may have been to different style Korean BBQ's, this is the type that is  <START:Food> buffet <END>  style, not the dim sum style. I typically compare Korean  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  on their kalbi, and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  stacks up right around the 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  range. Having been to, in my opinion, some of the best domestic Korean BBQ's back in Queens, NY, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  filled the void rather nicely. I'll definitely return for my monthly dose of pig intestine, And for 18$ a head? Gun bae!

I came upon Paradise Bakery by chance and just stopped by to have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and something sweet. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a caramel  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> snickerdoodle cookie <END> , and a  <START:F_Dessert> sugar cookie <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all okay, but not fantastic. I think  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a little pricey for what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  was pretty nice and seemed like a nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to study or read, but I probably wouldn't choose to go back.

This a great deli, by airports standards or otherwise.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a fairly  <START:S_Menu> limited <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  There are  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> wraps <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and prompt, which is great when you're rushing to a flight. Try the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  and cranberry  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is great! This is my go to for a quick  <START:Food> meal <END>  before heading to the security line.

 <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  were good but apparently  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't want to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the rent.  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is closed, locked up with a sign saying the lien holder has taken over. Guess I have to find a new  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now. Damnit.

Went here to break Passover this yearWhat we sampled:  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sampler      Definitely a good way to try different  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , to get an idea of what you like. I was really interested in the Hefeweizen with  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of banana and clove.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was definitely interesting smelled like bananas and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like cloves.  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  sample     The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and pretzels were great and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sauerkraut balls <END>  were definitely interesting.  I wasn't such a big fan of the potato  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  though.  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  spatzel     Total winner of the night.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was awesome. Apple Streudel     A classic, though I don't know if I would  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  again.  Not really my thing.  <START:Service> service <END>  was great and helpful!

Good Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  good a little on the spicey side. Kind of small could've been bigger. Good   <START:Service> service <END> .

Good  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> , but like a previous comment,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gets harder and harder to keep going back.  The way  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  process  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  is annoying, but that's not a deal-breaker if the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I've  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  mostly.   <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>   <START:W_Price> cost <END>  extra.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  isn't remarkable.  Overall the  <START:Food> food <END>  is just okay - good enough to stop by if  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's on the way to somewhere else -  <START:O_Experience> not good <END>  enough to make a trip specifically to dine there.

I was really unimpressed.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get a weak 3 based mainly on the  <START:Service> service <END>  which was the strong point of the visit this morning.Arriving about 8 on a Thursday morning the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was about full.  Given the choice between a booth and the counter I chose a booth.   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  decaf which there was afresh pot brewing and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came in a few  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Country  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  (normally $5.99 but was the daily special at $4.99) with 2  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , a split biscuit with gravy and 2 slices of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> .The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  were ok.  I prefer a sausage gravy rather than the  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  gravy  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  make but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ok.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was tasty but  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and not lean.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were runny in the middle.The building and  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  was showing a lot of wear.  There ware a lot of regulars even after the morning rush of folks heading off to work.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was really good and friendly.Overall this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was a reasonable value in that you could get a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  at fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  with  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  Not sure I would make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  part of a regular rotation but I may stop again because of where  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is in relation to where I travel.

I used to think Sephora was my "Happy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ," but that was until I went to Hough's.  Hough's is my happy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , and also you can't  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  at Sephora.So.Many. <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> !  At reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> !!!  Every time I leave the Sharp Edge I feel like I've left the bulk of my personal wealth there.  Not at Hough's!   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  that's good about the Sharp Edge, and you're not going to go broke.I also really liked that the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list was seperated by brewery, bc I am a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  snob.  Not a fan of Dogfish, but I do love my Troeg's.  I also really liked that on the back of the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer descriptions of each of the different  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  so you can sound like you know what the hell you are talking about when discussing the random  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  you've just  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> .  "I like the fruity finish of this Kolsch.  I believe this brewery is from a small basement in a small upstate NewYork town you've never heard of!"Pro tip:   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's winter.   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a black IPA or a Winter Warmer, don't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a Kolsch.  Ever.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are just  <START:O_Experience> not good <END> .My current favorite  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  at Hough's is 21st Ammendment Fireside Chat.  Try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  You'll love  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is my "thing" and I know what's up.  You'll like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , trust me.  I had a lot of  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were good.  The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was knowledgeable, and according to my friend (a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> ), she was also hot.  He appreciated that.The only thing I didn't like was the cold  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip.  There are certain  <START:Food> foods <END>  I call, " <START:S_Staff> guy <END>   <START:Food> foods <END> ."  Stuff  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  love and chicks are grossed out by.  This was one of them, bc my friend ate the whole thing while I poked at  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and said, "Is this just a block of cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  with shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  mixed in?"  I'm pretty sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was.  But my friend loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .I'll def be back, and you should go there too!

Ate here on our trip to Vegas last year using a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .com certificate.  Gotta love the  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  that let you include liquor the coupon.  We each had a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  that was delicious and not weak.  We shared the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  nachos that were excellent.  Shared a couple other  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  that also hit the mark well.  A bit small of a  <START:A_Places> space <END>  and you get to know your neighbors well.  Great deal with the certificate.

Well call me Sheila and throw another  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  on that barbie. Ok, so there's no Australian connection to Treacle, but the King Prawn  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  box I had here today was by far the best  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , and the best EVER  <START:F_FoodItem> king   prawns   <END> , I've ever had. We're talking about all my culinary dining  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  internationally here, and I've done all the whole med- <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  scene ample times.The  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were fresh off the barbie, really charred and flavoursome and juicy and mmm. Seriously, just...if you like  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END> , go and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  that  <START:Food> dish <END> . I want another one now, and I only had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  3 hours ago. As far as  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  go  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was better than any chinese takeaway I've had too. So, as far as my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of Treacle goes,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a pub and a gastro-pub, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is exceptional. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  doesn't give that away.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has the standard pies,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , open  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  etc. and doesn't seem to hint that  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 'll be anything other than good pub  <START:Food> food <END> . But ohmylord.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  I've had here has just been exceptionally well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  deserves every single one of these 5 sexy  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .I can't recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  highly enough for delicious pub grub. Read my other reviews of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  previously for an idea of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I am now definitely one of its biggest fans.

This is one of my all time favorite  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spots near my work. My girlfriend introduced this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to me a few months ago when I was craving Viet  <START:Food> food <END> . She encouraged me to try the bahn mi  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  I immediately fell in love. As I got to explore the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .. I quickly found this spot to have some the best pho I've ever had.. from living in California to now recently residing in Vegas. The rare  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>  is awesome especially when you get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  served on the side instead of already mixed in the broth allows you to drop in at your leisure to get soft "rare" slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .. very flavourful! ..Great cure for hangovers! I really enjoy the bbq  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are amazing (always fresh). The peanut dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  for the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  is definitely on point and is a must try if you eat here. Also the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are very reasonable and just a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for friends and  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  to get good local Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END> !

I was really  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  at Sage Garden!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  catered a meeting for us and  I thought their  <START:Food> food <END>  really stood out: <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came in (on time) and set  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all up for us in a timely/professional manner (as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a working  <START:Food> lunch <END> ) <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> - Excellent, I had  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  & swiss although  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , ham, and I believe roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  to choose from.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all served on soft croissant  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  A veg option would have been great and some individual mustard/mayo's rather than a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  one for all to share ( the germaphobe in me would have appreciated  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .) <START:S_Staff> they <END>  provided potato  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which was DELICIOUS! Red  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , green  <START:F_Ingredients> onion <END> , mayo -based, non-sweet, with almost a hint of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was really good.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also gave us some incredible chocolate brownies, which were just so good I wish I grabbed one more before I left. Overall the  <START:Food> food <END>  was really delicious-  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a step above many of the other franchised options. Fresh and tasty, just the way I like my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to be : ) I'd highly recommend them.

Of Wolfley and Man! (Metallica Reference!)I came here for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with an associate and I wanted to try something new. Wolfley's was definitely something you can't find anywhere in the country so what the hey! I would have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  their hometown favorite roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  warned me  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was quite salty.  I'm glad she did since I don't take kindly on overly salty  <START:Food> foods <END> . So I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheeseburger <END>  sliders instead. Let's just say I wasn't sure if should have sucked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  up and tried the roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  instead. Sliders were, well sub par and basic.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty dry and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came along with some  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> onion <END>  flakes. I needed to douse  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with some ketchup to help me swallow  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . My  <START:Food> meal <END>  also came along with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which was probably the better of the two. However, I found a few brown leaves and tried to work around  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was good overall and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty well put together. Definitely a cool  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang with the boys for a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . I went on Wolfey's website and notice  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are fond of charitable work and non-profits coming to their  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  - Kudos! Then again in my honest opinion I'm not sure I would want to recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  unless  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . - Enjoy!

The strip mall exterior belies the treasure within! When you enter, you're immediately  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  by the smell of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Normally the smell of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is not a pleasant one for me. As in, makes me lose my appetite. So,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a huge compliment when I say, the smells coming out of the open  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  are mouthwatering. When one of my dining companions received her  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END> , there were yet more mouthwatering aromas. WTH kind of alchemy is going on in that  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  make this vegetarian salivate over dead animal? No matter, fellow lovers of the plant plate, there's options for you here. For starters, you *must*  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the Brussels sprouts ( <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do come with panchetta, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  can be left off). DIEvine. Seriously. As are the roasted root  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . I love when something simple is so delicious.I normally never eat mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's so two-note (duh), but Beckett's  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  makes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so that I finally *get* why people are all gaga over this stuff.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's very subtle, but those mustard seeds take the  <START:Food> dish <END>  to a whole other level of delish bliss. My  <START:Food> entree <END> , the oven roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  tower was probably the least exciting thing I ate last night night, but still flavorful in its own right and beautifully plated. I'm just not a fan of roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  which comprise about half of the stack. I'll leave this tiny meh at that, because the entire  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  blows that away into the ether. Next up,  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . Although thoroughly stuffed at this point, I managed a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> potato pie <END>  (incredible), the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry cobbler <END>  (delightfully tart, balanced with a sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream) and the piéce de resistance, fig (yes, I said fig) and  <START:F_FoodItem> pecan pie <END> .I'd be remiss to not mention the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  list, which seemed quite creative.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard for me to choose, but I had the Az Farmhand, which has Hendricks gin,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> , ginger,  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  and honey, many of my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  did not disappoint. Fabulous selection of wines by the glass, too.A thoroughly lovely  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  from start to finish, Beckett's  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  provides top notch  <START:Food> food <END>  at affordable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> , with impeccable  <START:Service> service <END>  in a rustic  <START:A_Environment> environment <END>  (you feel like you're in the hippest, coziest lodge).

Too bad the  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> schmear <END>  were delicious, because the  <START:Service> service <END>  was terrible. When I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  +  <START:F_FoodItem> matzo <END>  ball (which was alright but not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  $5.99) I asked for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  in the plastic container to go, I was argued with, being told the paper like container was more safe and better for  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> ... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  promptly spilled because the lid wasn't tight enough, and in my car.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  looks amazing when you walk in and feel like you have entered a 70's  <START:Food> diner <END> . Then the longer you spend there the less amazing  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  became. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is terrible and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took forever to get our  <START:Food> food <END> . I made my own  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  but found the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  has no seasoning at all, just  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  made into a patty and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were not bad but the mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> not good <END>  at all,  one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  was enough for me. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  looked good but i am sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was like most of the stuff in this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Looks great but leaves a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in your mouth.

We initially wanted to go to Wicked Spoon for the  <START:Food> buffet <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were about to close to prepare for dinner. We saw Holsteins along the way and decided to check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out. We both got the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , which was okay. My son enjoyed the  <START:F_FoodItem> mini sliders <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, but maybe a bit overpriced, mostly likely due to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in the Cosmo. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was fantastic and really catered to our kids needs.

 <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty much all  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  and barely any  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . My boyfriend got sick from the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  he had. Won't go back.

This was hands down the best  <START:Food> meal <END>  I had during my recent trip to Phoenix.Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was very friendly and helpful - walking us through the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , making suggestions, and just being overall very pleasant.My husband and I started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Belly Pastrami, which was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and delicious.  We scarfed down the whole thing.For  <START:Food> entrees <END> , I went with the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  were nicely prepared, but I could have eaten a whole bowl of just the  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> . Mm - so so good.My husband had the  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>  which were definitely the right way to go.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were delicious.And, even though we were both too full to move, I really wanted to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  pudding, so we went for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  So.  <START:W_Price> worth <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  The only unfortunate thing was that at 8:00 on the Sunday night before Columbus day, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was pretty much  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END> .  I would have expected more of a  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt a little ... i don't know..not happening. But, despite the lack of a  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  stands on its  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in AZ

Amazing little  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have some seriously wonderful  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . You can't go wrong with the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  board, the  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbreads <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> charcuterie board <END> , or the  <START:F_FoodItem> warm brie <END> ...  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're all to die for! OH, the  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END>  are great too! I wasn't thrilled with the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  to be honest, but that was my only disappointment. One more thing I was simply so bummed about was  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  discontinued the rock  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and that was my FAVORITE. I still ask every time I go in just to see if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will bring  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. :) You just cannot beat the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection, the delicious  <START:Food> food <END> , and the great  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> . This is a must try!

I was driving down Buffalo and came across this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Boy am I glad I stopped by.OMG! This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the bomb diggity! Never expected the  <START:Food> food <END>  to be so delicious!   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's like an explosion of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  in your mouth! The red  <START:F_FoodItem> velvet pancake <END>  is to die for. I'm from Hawaii so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a surprise to see Hawaiian  <START:Food> dishes <END>  served here.  To all the Hawaiians in Las Vegas this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  give Cinnamons  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  HARD RUBS! Plus  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve Zippy's Chilli here!!! I tried the Adobe  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  Omelette and the Kailua Pig Benedict! A+ in my books!The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was wonderful! Very friendly and very prompt.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  filled our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  when needed and provided a smile every time  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came by.  I know this is random but their  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  was so good! Very Cold and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh! That is also a plus for me when checking out a new  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  as you know you don't always want to get  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . So rest assured if you want  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  here your gonna have a good one.  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is very reasonable for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  your are going to receive.  The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are more than decent to get you full and possible end up taking some to go!I had a great overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as a first timer.  I don't live next to this area but with the results of having a friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , amazing  <START:Food> food <END> , and decent  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  I will not hesitate to take a drive to eat here again!

First visit to Emzy last weekend and my wife and I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a little weird when we arrived around 7:45 on a Saturday night and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was dead. I was worried the  <START:Food> food <END>  might not be good, but I have to say that  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was great! We both eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  all the time and we had some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  here at Emzy. I am not sure why the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed out with patrons. The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is trendy and cool, the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  great. I have to assume that the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , not near Trade and Tryon or the Epicenter, are the only reason  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was mostly  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END> . Well, that is a shame. If you like  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not to be missed. We loved the Drunken  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> , and especially loved the Sweet 18  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a bit pricey at $16, but the Sweet 18 was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  every  <START:W_Price> penny <END> ! The  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  Tuna Ball small plate was excellent as well. If you're a fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , I would recommend Emzy for sure!

I got the three  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  on my first time here. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was just wonderful.

This is the 3rd  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  I've tried out.  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  Jungle does NOT disappoint!  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  about their  <START:Food> food <END>  is consistent. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly. I wish we had these  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Florida.  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END> !

I am a native Phoenician and Mexican American. I was shocked to find this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  serving such authentic Mexican  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was similar to my Mother's cooking. Try the seafood with Mojo de Ajo ( <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ).  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  added peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  to the Mojo de Ajo and this was truly a delicacy know  to very few locals.Try the Dos Amigos ( <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> ) - $13.25. The  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  are the 2  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>   Man and Wife. Beautiful  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and very pleasant young  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END> /waitresses  12-29-12  looking forward to 2013

Amazing pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ! The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was charred and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just right. The sides are huge  <START:A_Places> portions <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> poutine <END>  was pretty tasty but not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ! More  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just right.

45  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for undercooked  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>  (so called tiger  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> )  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  platter came with plastic wrap around pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  my favorite  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  had literally 10% of liquor and the rest was  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   ...wanted to impress my boyfriend with some classy Italian  <START:Food> food <END> , so I did!

Favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  in Charlotte. If I hadn't lived in Chicago previously, I might say my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ever. I love the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  both  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  and out, but you can't beat the rooftop deck. With this building's bad reputation for keeping tenants, I hope JJ's can make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for the long haul. I'm a big fan.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  must be doing something right, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was crowded.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was acceptable, but not exceptional.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  (Maple  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and Tiramisu) were  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  with topping on top, not wrapped within as one normally does for a  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> .  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  or so for the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  to come out, and the presentation of the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  seemed rushed--toppings were just sort of dumped on top of the folded  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> , like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was prepared by someone in a rush.  I suspect  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did not have a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  floorspace or  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  adequate to meet demand.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and considerate and the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was pleasant.  While not terrible,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was not really  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  or the  <START:W_Price> price <END> .  I doubt I will go back.

Bacchanal  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is located at Ceasars Palace.I'm a victim of expecting a grand feast from this mega  <START:Food> buffet <END> , only to have my expectations shattered like a huge mirror hitting a concrete floor. Fellow Yelpers raved about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and friends that had gone, had also raved about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . So naturally I bookmarked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and anxiously awaited my time to feast like a king at the " <START:Food> buffet <END>  of all  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> ."Upon arriving at the entrance to the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was already clear that we came during the dinner rush. The line was insanely long.  Fast forward 1.5 hours later and we were finally  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END> ....oh yes,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took us 1.5 hours of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  & $50+ per person to get in. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is freaking huge.  <START:Food> food <END>  on  <START:Food> food <END>  on  <START:Food> food <END>  &  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  on  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  on  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was pretty and oozed of opulence for a  <START:Food> buffet <END> . We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  relatively close to the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  station. The entire  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a blur, there was a lot to choose from ( <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END> , ethnic  <START:Food> foods <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> , sides,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , soups, etc) and yet nothing specific comes to mind about what was the best at that  <START:Food> buffet <END> . However, I did enjoy the crab legs and the choice of either cold crab legs or boiled crab legs; which were boiled fresh upon each  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . The only thing I didn't like about Bacchanal was the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Ambience> set up <END> . The majority of the  <START:Food> food <END>  stations and the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  station were located in the same  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ; but the crab legs and the majority of the Asian  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  were located in a separate  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> . I suppose this is my  <START:Food> buffet <END>  pet peeve and the worst offender is the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at Mandalay Bay, where the majority of each  <START:Food> food <END>  station is sectioned off in its own  <START:A_Places> space <END> @!&$# LOL I digress. I'm pretty sure the long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  left a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth making my expectation of the Bacchanal that much more important. Would I come back to Bacchanal? Yes, to give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  another shot, BUT will need to time my next visit so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't coincide during the rush -_-

We had tickets to the Mercury  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and were trying to get away from the crowds when we stumbled upon this amazing little  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END> !We both had chubby  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  with ranch  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an Oreo Shake. Prepare to be wowed. I don't know what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is about this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is an  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Plenty of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  mixed with the freshness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and soft  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>  whole grain  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ....well  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just indescribable and also very affordable!You need to visit soon!

Decided to go here instead of my normal Chipotle fix. I had the roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  club., <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was loaded with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  but definitely not eat. Just a few slices of each and maybe  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard to tell under all he  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was really tasty, seemed fresh! The   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was just over $9. A bit pricey for what you get. There are some other  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  shops motto far from here that have better  <START:Food> food <END>  at a better  <START:W_Price> price <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems this store just opened. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is prepared super fast. I will give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  another trying few weeks to see if this was just a new opening hiccup.

We just came from having the BEST  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  we have ever eaten.  We had the Sicilian and added artichokes.  Unbelievably delicious, Artisan style and fresh.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was wonderful.  The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> / <START:S_Staff> cook <END>  and entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  made their way over to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  just to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sell homemade french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and rosemary/kalamata  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  Took two loaves home.  Don't listen to one word negative about the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  or  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  really was delightful. fyi:  to Lenne O from Denver...  You must have been in the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  across the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot because 1)you do not serve your own beverage  2) there isn't a chalkboard and 3) you don't prepay or pre-tip.  None of that...

The  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  here was average. I went with a healthier option on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and did not get my  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END> , I got the kabobs. There was nothing special about the  <START:Food> dish <END>  BUT the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  properly. I would go back here and try something different. Also great  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  from Forest Gump!!!

You'll feel like you're eating in a Havana Bistro with a Cuba Libre on the side and expect a hand  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>  cuban cigar to follow your  <START:Food> meal <END>  under palm trees.  Which leaves one massive mystery: I've never seen a cuban cooking, serving,  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , or eating there.  I'm not sure a cuban has ever so much as walked by Saluds door.  Yet, magically,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was teleported over from Fidel Castro's personal  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  right to your Pittsburgh plate.Incredibly fresh  <START:Food> dishes <END> , high on  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was genuine and warm, and the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  even offered us holiday  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  his wife made as a  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  for free just to be friendly.  The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is totally standard Lawrenceville/Pittsburgh  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , and has no hint of the cuban  <START:F_FI_Taste> deliciousness <END>  that is conjured up in their  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a solid craft brew list with a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  number of rotating bottles and drafts, and reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  across the board.I'd love to see the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  match the excellent cuban  <START:Food> food <END>  and strong  <START:Service> service <END> , but I'd gladly come back either way.  For great cuban  <START:Food> food <END>  at great  <START:W_Price> prices <END> , Salud, I salute you!

I decided to come here after driving past  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so many times. The first thing I noticed was their dull  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , no creativity what so ever. I'm a graphic designer so for me precentation means a lot. Anyway, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> tripa <END>  and an  <START:F_FoodItem> al pastor <END> . I was the only one there, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took them a good five  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to prepare them. Not only that,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  messed up my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  gave me a  <START:F_FoodItem> cabeza <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> tripa <END> . Very disappointed. If I ever come back I'll know what to expect.

I really wanted to love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ....especially from the good reviews and because we drove from Henderson just to go and eat here (about 45 minute drive).  We went for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  on a Sunday and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  did not seem too busy.  There were plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  available and there was a small line to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  take your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at one counter and then you  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in line to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at another counter. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and then stood in line for about 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before we could even  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  The  <START:Ambience> set up <END>  is just not expeditious in any way.  We got a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for our  <START:Food> food <END> .  There were four of us; 2 people in our party received their  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in about 35  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> ....the other 2 received their  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in about 50  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .....which was over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  from when we first made our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a Benedict and a 3  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  (total).....so over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  seems completely unacceptable to me for such a small and simple  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  The Pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Benedict was good and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was nicely  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  but their Cuban  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was flavorless.  I was so hoping that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be good enough for the  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  plus  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ....but I was really disappointed.  We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a side of  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> ...but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a small plate of about 10  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END> , small slices.  The portion was really small for a  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  side  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were also MEH.....nothing special and no seasonings or herbs at all.  To be honest, I would not make the trip across town again with so many better options.

My wife and I just happened to be at Starbucks when we decide to try Taco Guild. Once arriving we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  very quickly. Unfortunately  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  that hadn't  been cleaned (kinda gross if you'd ask me) which shows a lack of communication between who ever is cleaning the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and who ever is sitting them (or  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  couldn't care less where  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sat my wife and I). The  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and chairs are booth style so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a bit uncomfortable for me. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very nice and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  us very warmly. Unfortunately (and I might attribute this to a busy night on his end) we weren't really told about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Once the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  left my wife and I felt as if we knew nothing more about Taco Guild then when we sat down, this could have been excused if this  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  had been open for a couple of months but this was the third night  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was opened. All in all the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was great  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came out quick and hot and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  seemed to have adjusted better and was accessible more and more throughout our  <START:Food> meal <END> . I recommend the Taco Guild the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great at the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is killer and I'm very excited to see if there are any sports nights or weekends coming up at Taco Guild. If you're a selective eater please make sure to ask questions (next time I'll take my own advice as well). Please see below for a personal side note...*The  <START:Food> meal <END>  went fine and I seldom felt a I need to call my  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  over. As we were leaving a man which I presumed worked there (he was standing around looking at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and standing with the host and what I assumed to be the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ...or maybe he was the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) went to the door and held  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  open. What I hadn't realized was that he was holding  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  open for a couple (white and in there 50's maybe) coming in and not for my wife and I (Hispanic and white respectably) which were going out. The man after noticing my wife and I motioning towards the door continues to motion the couple which was entering to come in. Awkward at best this situation left a poor  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth.

Great  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  but bad  <START:Service> service <END> .  Sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and pretty much had the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  thrown at me.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took about ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  to notice me after I had a chance to review the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was my first time there and probably my last. Sucks because I was really excited about going there.

back already!  My husband had the really  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  combo, and I had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchilada and  <START:F_FoodItem> taco combo <END> .. I must admit, the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was really tasty.   <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END> , but not overpowering.  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was not really that  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  say all their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END> .Next time, I'll get the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  too.good  <START:Food> food <END> , smiling  <START:Service> service <END> , clean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .

I have to admit, I wasn't particularly adventurous with my  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  when I ate here last week. We arrived around 12:30 and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty busy.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are still offering their regular  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  for 50% off so I got a few off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to try. My dining companion  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  special, which was also a pretty good deal. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was all pretty fresh and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were made well. I would have given them 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  if  <START:Service> service <END>  was a bit better. I know  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a little busy, but  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  went unfilled and our  <START:Food> food <END>  came out slow. Their AYCE  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were reasonable and I have a Groupon burning a hole in my pocket, so I will be back. Looking forward to trying more items off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Both the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  items look enticing.

The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  are extremely nice and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is quite delicious. Nice, Authentic, and a great  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the Middle East.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  absolutely lives up to its  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ! Amazing  <START:Food> food <END> , amazing  <START:Service> service <END> , and adorable pens shaped like chopsticks holding nigiri :P The special with sea bass and  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>  salt was my favorite, but the trout with pop rocks and the tadas were amazing too.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  we has was fresh and delicious. But whatever you do, don't ask for Louis... He's mine!

I've been to Pomo for several company outings and for dinner dates. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  never wavers whether I'm there with two people or twenty -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is always an excellent visit with knowledgable  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  and delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> . Any of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  are absolutely delicious as well, I wouldn't hesitate trying a new option here at all. Definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a visit, don't miss the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  in cooler weather!

Clean and friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Had the Dac Biet  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  and spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Overall, tasty, would recommend to an out of towner as a safe bet. Hits the pho craving you just have to add your own spices/sriracha.

Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have lots of gluten free options and I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are  <START:O_Pay_Price> priced <END>  well! I go in at least once a week for their  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> !!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the best I have ever had!! And I alway have great  <START:Service> service <END> !

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  might become my new go to  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  I went in for the first time since the remodel and was extremely  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .  The whole  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  feels wry opened and bright and clean.  With the number of TVs  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have all around the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  this is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to watch football. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great, our  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  knew the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  well and gave us some great recommendations.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  pretzels to start and I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  cesar melt.   <START:Food> food <END>  came out fast and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delicious. I'll definitely be back here.

I've travel 52 weeks per year. I grew up in Pittsburgh, lived in Chicago for 5 years came back this year.  Been to Italy, New York...Fiori's is the best.   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is great,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  is great,  <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and entertaining.  I have been going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for 20 years.

After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and was  <START:O_Experience> completely unimpressed <END> . Even though the shop was nearly empty, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  parm  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of  <START:F_Ingredients>   crispy   breaded   chicken   <END>  inside, it had plain unseasoned  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  slices which was covered in  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  one step away from  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> . To top it all off the  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwaved <END> , which made the inside insanely hot and turned to  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to rubber.Maybe their  <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> subs <END>  are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> , it definitely won't be  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .

The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , perfectly reasonable.  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is convenient, especially if you're catching a flick nearby. The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is about what you'd expect: Not  <START:Food> stellar <END> , but not horrible either. It's on the pricey side, but you probably know that already. It takes  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to keep the engine running.What is really bad is the  <START:Service> service <END> . Well, that's not entirely true. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is actually friendly - very much so, in fact. They  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  you, and  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  you fairly promptly (at the appropriate  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> ), keep your  <START:F_Drinks> beverages <END>  filled, clear  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> , just about everything.But the wait for the  <START:Food> food <END>  is absolutely ridiculous. Not one of those "where is the  <START:Food> food <END> " moments, but about ten of them, back to back, and it's not just when they are busy - even when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is empty, it takes forever to be served. It could be blamed on the freshness of the  <START:Food> food <END> , but we're talking even  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and fairly simple  <START:F_FoodItem> stir fry <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END> , so this isn't rocket science.Or perhaps it is and all those other Chinese places just do it better.

This is where I had the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  of my life. It is hands down one of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  houses in the city, in any city. The  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  is always amazing, which it should be because it will  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  you. That is the only down side but you truely get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and I believe it is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it everytime.Go and enjoy because you will be speaking about it for days, months, and years... seriously =)

Always good- the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> generous <END>  and flavorful. The veal  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are very  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  without being heavy. Cappachio chilled ,  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I think this is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to meet friends or bring out of towners. I have been a fan of Chef Nina and her  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  for many many years.

Fantastic  <START:Food> food <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> live music <END> , locally owned. This is our favorite spot to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  for sure.

Well, i think i'm one of a hand full of ladies who actually like  <START:Restaurant> hooters <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .  so my boyfriend took myself and another couple  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for my birthday  <START:Food> dinner <END>  , one of my 4 night stay in vegas (@ treasure island)we also wanted to see  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .. not that  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  anyway..The  <START:Food> food <END>  was okay, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was awful, of all the  <START:Restaurant> hooters <END>  i've been to this is the worst by far. And you'd think its be the BEST since its  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> / <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .. not the case.

I've been coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for about five years and today was my last day. I sat down and pulled out my e-cigarette as I have been doing for the past three years. I ordered a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I decided on my usual and placed my order. When the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came back, she said I was not allowed to use my e-cigarette  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END> . As per the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , "E-cigarettes are no longer allowed but cigarettes and cigars are." When I first started coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , I was a smoker! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is great and they have a nice  <START:F_Drinks> draught <END>  selection. I have nothing against smoke or smokers, obviously because this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has tons of smokers who are usuals. I really liked the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  too! The low ceilings combined with the  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  smokers makes for a vintage Vegas  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  that you really can't find much these days.Don't try to apply logic  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . It really makes no sense. I honestly think someone could get away with smoking a joint in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is that much smoke. Make sure you don't bring your electronic cigarette though, you could fill those with  <START:F_Ingredients> cannabis <END> ! The ironic part is that  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a sign out front that says ' <START:A_Plc_SmokingArea> smoker friendly <END> .'If the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  banned cigarettes AND e-cigarettes, that would somewhat make sense, but I STILL wouldn't go back. At least he was being consistent.Do not go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to watch Buckeyes  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  either, they will yell at you for being loud when you are just cheering. I can't speak for Browns  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  on Sunday though. The local Buckeye  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is now PT's Gold on Rainbow anyway and has been for several years now.Pros: Very smokey, like Jazz pool-hall it has that smokey-blue tinge in the right  <START:A_Decor> light <END> .The usuals are all great!The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is fantastic!Cons:No electronic cigarettes.

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  at great  <START:W_Price> prices <END> . I hadnt been  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in years but found it again this past weekend and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is still just as good as ever and the  <START:Food> portions <END>  are just as gigantic as ever. Also one of the few places that still have Stuffed Hot Banana Peppers. If you get the  <START:F_FoodItem>   crab   balls <END> , order them with the honey mustard dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .

The Giant Carumba  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  for $5.95 are you kidding me, this is 3  <START:Food> meals <END>  for me.  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  takes up the entire  <START:S_Cutlery> aluminum tin <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Even though it is huge still has good  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , I get the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and it is served wet in the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Also comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and has a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  good  <START:F_FoodItem>   salsa     bar   <END> .You order at the counter and they call your number to pick up the  <START:Food> food <END> . If you are looking for a fast  <START:F_FI_Price> inexpensive <END>  good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  clean Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , this is it, They do live up to their motto "Where you don't PESO much!"For the  <START:W_Price> money <END>  you spend and the  <START:Food> food <END>  you get it is a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> , but 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  is an over the top  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for me.Use to go to the one in Glendale, but with work have been coming for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to the one on Bell Road. Same good  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> 

Premium  <START:Food> food <END>  mixed with daily  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> . Definitely a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to check out.

My absolute favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  Unless you are in a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is never more then a 10 minute wait, even on Sunday morning when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  appears to be packed.Friendly  <START:Service> service <END> , and the pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is to die for.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  have been  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I was tempted to stop in just to buy a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of the pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to go. The  <START:F_FoodItem> omelets <END>  are huge, consider sharing if you aren't a heavy eater. Never had anything other then  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  so not sure how the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is.

The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is awesome...like, seriously awesome. I've tried several of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and haven't had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>  yet.  Also awesome: the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I find that  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Las Vegas its hard to find good  <START:Service> service <END>  (which is odd because I would have thought the opposite) so I love coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  in because its always a very pleasant  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Ask for Anthony or Don they are both fantastic and friendly  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> . The only reason I gave  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END>  instead of 5 is because their  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining rooms <END>  are extremely crowded when busy and it feels very claustrophobic in those situations. It won't stop me from going back though!

I didn't know  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so many different   <START:F_FoodItem> cheeses <END>  to put on my Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> , he asked me what kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  I wanted I was lost I said "Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> " lol but on the real I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . the corner  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  scares me with so much speeding traffic i always think about a car or truck crashing into people trying to enjoy this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  be safe...

 <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare ordered....well done received. Disappointing for a $50 plus  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  I don't send  <START:Food> food <END>  back to the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , it frightens me. Slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  will be ordered in a bit.

A great steakhouse amongst the excess of options that Vegas provides. We arrived at 7 on a Thursday and had  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> , though the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was not busy enough to require them. I ordered the filet mignon,  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> , and my wife ordered the prime rib, also  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> . Both were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly, and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was extremely high.For sides we had the yukon gold puree, very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> green beans <END> , also very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . They have a great  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  selection, some nice house  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  (I had the Fire and  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  I believe it was called, a fun mix of  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> ), and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great.The only downside was the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> / <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . The entrance is directly from the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  floor, which I tend to like the  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  set back more from the crowds, but once we were in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  far back inside, and it was nice and quiet.Overall, a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat for a nice  <START:Food> meal <END>  with amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> . Would definitely go back

I am a prime  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  steakhouse lover! I consider myself an expert in the craft. I have had them all. Flemings, Mortons, Donovans, Ruth Chris ehhh. None compare to Del Friscos! The  <START:Food> portions <END>  are huge and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> ! The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  are second to none! Whenever I stay at the Hard Rock, I make it a point to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?By far the best  <START:Service> service <END> !

We went to Roy's on the advice of a friend and were  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> ! The Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was "melt-in-your-mouth" amazing and the Mai Tais were yummy!   Hard to believe that this is a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> !  The  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  was not " <START:F_FI_Taste> vanilla <END> " and  <START:Service> service <END>  was outstanding!

My friend and I stopped  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  immediately, and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very nice and prompt with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  refills.  They have a huge range of options for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , and almost everything is made  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , not  <START:F_FI_Quality> boxed <END>  or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END> , which is always a plus.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Apple Compote  <START:F_Ingredients> waffle <END> , and the  <START:F_Ingredients> waffle <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> honey butter <END>  was amazing.  I'd probably go back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  looking, fluffy  <START:F_FoodItem> pankcakes <END>  or some homemade pie.

Nothing out of this world... 1/2 of our 10  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  was pretty burnt and undersized. The other  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  of our order was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  properly and we enjoyed it.However, the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was very unprofessional during our visit and spoke to me and other customers as if he was hanging out with his buddies, rather than  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  customers.

Pancake  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  holds a  <START:O_Experience> special <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in my heart, I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and tried the famous  <START:F_FoodItem> apple pancake <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem>   bacon   pancakes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pumpkin pancakes <END> , and lately I've been really in love with their  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> .  They also have  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> thick cut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> . I'm surprised people don't like the  <START:F_FoodItem> pumpkin pancakes <END>  because my boyfriend is crazy about them and gets them every time. Speaking of my boyfriend, we went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on our first date.  To the Yelp-er who said that this is where people take their one night stands... almost fell off my  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  laughing at that one.  We went back for our 1 year anniversary, we'll be back for number 2.  :)My one caution is that yes, it is as ridiculously crowded as everyone says it is, so be prepared to wait or go on an week day.

Fun spot for  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  and a  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .  Interesting scene.

I really really don't get the hype over Nobu. Yeah, the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is beautiful, the presentation of the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great, it's always filled with fun people and it's in the Hard Rock  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  (one of my favorite hotels in Vegas)...BUUUUUUUUUUUT the  <START:Food> food <END>  is waaay overrated. I'm Japanese so I think I have a pretty good idea of what good Japanese  <START:Food> food <END>  is. This wasn't it. Sorry.

Still the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  I've been to.  Of course, you have to keep in mind that's it's a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  so for the peeps expecting a 3-Michelin  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , you will be disappointed.  The only complaint I have is that a year later, the Wynn  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is still  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  the same  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  (and  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> !) are still  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> !

I really dont know how people  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  so high. 1. Its was $50 for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  because of 18% gratuity2. the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  were mostly dry, they had  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  at the carving station and they were dry as can be.  Tell me how can  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  be dry???3. was not  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the selection at all, all their  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  said Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  but who care if it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  bad and plus its American Kobe which isn't real Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . 4. the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was okay,  <START:F_Dessert>   ice   cream <END>  was good 5. so overrated for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , just a tourist trap6. better going to a sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> .I felt raped by the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  to  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .never again do a Vegas  <START:Food> buffet <END> , I always used to love  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  when I was younger but the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  now a days just doesn't justify going to one. Better  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>  at a sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Plus do a free walk around before you decide all  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  let you do this before buying it.

Best  <START:F_FoodItem> barbeque <END>  around, great  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . Could use better  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  makes up for it.

Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang out and have a  <START:F_Drinks> drank <END>  on,  <START:A_Ent_Music> karaoke <END> , Dj with  a  <START:A_Entertainment> dance floor <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staffs <END>  are awesome! The sig sig is out of this world

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is absolutely horrible! 1 the  <START:Service> service <END>  is just horrible, our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  practically ignored us all night with our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  empty and we had to ask her multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to get refills. 2 we ordered our  <START:Food> food <END>  and it took forever to come out. I mean like 40 min with only 2  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  next to us and others dancing so that has absolutely no excuse for the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  to be taking so long to make our  <START:Food> food <END> . 3 when we try to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  (which was only 38 dollars) I only had a 50 which is relatively close to the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  and our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  said they didnt have change in the drawer, I mean its a 12 dollar change!!! What kind of a restraunt doesnt have 12 dollars change in the  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  drawer?!?!? Well thats my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and it was absolutely fucking horrible. I wish I could put zero stars.

$24.99 for  <START:Food> brunch <END> .    <START:Food> food <END>  was soso, I expect much better from Mandalay Bay...

The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is mediocre.Not bad, but not super good. If you're a foodie, you will have to choose wisely. Not everything in the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is good, but you must pick and choose.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some diamonds  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END> .My husband and I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on a Friday for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  a few months ago. We had scored BOGO tickets for our  <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a GREAT deal! For the two of us (for a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> ), we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $23 total. I would definitely come back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in a heart beat. The value was phenomenal for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . But of course for the next time I'd do the same thing, pick out the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  things (and trust me,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some- including yummy Lox!) out of the sea of mediocre  <START:Food> food <END> .

Was turned onto this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  by a friend. When you walk in, you get this Truck Stop, dirty, dingy type of a feel. This has never scared me because most of the  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , these places have the best  <START:Food> food <END> ! (Check out Polaris  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  behind the Rio All-Suites  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> ! Best  <START:Food> breakfast <END> !)Sat down and everything appears to be a tad old and run down. But, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was pretty decent. You could tell these people aren't corporate, and I don't mind that at all. I ordered the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , wet (with  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) and  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  with hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and the other  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END> . I like my  <START:Food> food <END>  hot and this was HOT!!! At first I thought I wasn't going to be able to handle, but then I adapted. LIke I said, I like my  <START:Food> food <END>  HOT!!The  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  as if it were prepared by someone who knows Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> , and not by someone trained to  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  and emulate it. My overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was that even thought it aint the prettiest or cleanest  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  more than makes up for it. I say at least give it a shot and judge for yourself. Will I eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again? As Dave Hester would say..."YUUUP!"

The real deal!  Great  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , true  <START:Food> diner <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Can't ask for more.

Back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again with my monthly ladies'  <START:Food> lunch <END>  group. I ordered the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  combo: 1  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and a  <START:F_Drinks> tropical   ice     tea   <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  noodle  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  today, it was loaded with  <START:F_Ingredients> goodies <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> celery <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and lots of noodles). The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was good, not too salty. I ordered the pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Unfortunately, it is on the extra  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  side. The tip of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was a black and the crust was super  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . I did not attempt to eat the crust, way too hard. It was better last time. The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and nonstop flowing of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was good. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is always excellent.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ! The people are usually nice & helpful.  We live near Nellis AFB so this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  isn't close to us but we come on this side of town just for the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> !  Wish they would open up a shop over close to us!  That would be awesome! (Hint, hint) ;)

Omfg diablo  <START:Food> hot   wing   <END>  challenge is not a joke, they use  <START:F_Ingredients> ghost chilli extract <END> , warning do not do challenge my tongue, throat, cheek and ears went numb and no I did not finish the 20  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  only ate 15  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  ....

Winner winner Tuna melt sammich. They use albacore white, Swiss  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on a  <START:F_Ingredients> soft heated bun <END> .  It was Earlicius!!! Sorry no pics, scarfed that bad boy down.  It was also a really good  <START:Food> portion <END> , not gijimbo just right.

Sure, Vegas has some of the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in the world. So when you want something fast,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> , and easy, shouldn't it still be at the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  you expect? That's what I found at Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . Not just a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but a low  <START:W_Price> price <END>  hot  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  gourmet grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> . I had the chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END> , and it was far more than I expected. It was not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  I've ever had in my life, but it was absolutely  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> , quick, and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  for about $6. If you don't want to blow a ton of  <START:W_Price> money <END>  on a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat and you'd rather spend it in the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> , then grab a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  from the Earl.

This was easily one of the best  <START:Food> meals <END>  I have ever had, the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was awesome. Just an all around great dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . GET THE  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  FOR  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> !!!

Consistently excellent!  Had  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last night and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was superior,  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent as well.  We come to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> marketplace <END>  often and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is always beautifully presented and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is consistent.  Well done, we will continue to come back!

I visited this little jewel when it first opened and bought six  <START:Food> pastries <END>  to take to a friends  <START:Food> luncheon <END> . I was really disappointed and never went back. Three years later, looking for a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  near my home, I stumbled upon Scratch again, this time to rave reviews. I decided to give it another chance and get actual  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and I am so glad that I did! I chose the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict with ham (I will try the  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END>  next time). This is the first  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Phoenix/Scottsdale to get hollandaise right (they make their own), the poached  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were perfection. Now, I normally get really irritated at a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  on a plate of great  <START:Food> food <END>  as an afterthought. At first, I ignored it and dove into the actual  <START:Food> food <END>  that I ordered. I decided to use it as a  <START:F_FoodItem> palate cleanser <END>  but then I couldn't stop eating it! No "afterthought" sides for Scratch!  My husband said the hash browns were the best ever and I agree. They are  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  with maybe  <START:F_Ingredients> fennel <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END> ?  I was full so I had to get my  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  to go. The  <START:F_Dessert> salted caramel <END>  is just like butta!!  I would love to keep this little  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to myself but it wouldn't be fair to the rest of humanity.

Everyone at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  (4  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> ) all had different  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> entres <END> . Needless to say, all of us raved about our  <START:Food> meals <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  we had, I believe his name was Matt was fantastic with his  <START:Service> recommendations <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> . If I stay at Palms again, I would return for sure.

I go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  frequently because it's only a couple miles from my work and much better than the nearby Souper  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . I usually order a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  caesar or salmon  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is flavorless and  <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  extra, but without it I'd probably still feel hungry after. I noticed that when I first started going earlier this year they filled the bowl to the top with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , but now it seems like they only fill it  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  way. I like that you tell them what  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  you want instead of your typical  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where you always wonder who touched or sneezed on the  <START:Food> food <END> . They chop your  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which is very nice. The  <START:A_Decor> dressings <END>  are good, but unless you like a ton of dressing make sure you tell them you only want a little because they put a lot on. They also have a punch card and punch it 2  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  if you get a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  (only  <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  $1 more), or 1 time if you get a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Overall it's an OK  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .

Unless you REALLY have to have a  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , I suggest you go to the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .It's not like the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  aren't good.  They're ok, I suppose.  The choices are limited and so are the ' <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> '.   <START:Service> service <END>  is ok but could be improved.  My husband liked it a lot more than I did 'coz we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  TWICE but it's just a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  to me.  Nothing out of the ordinary nor gourmet about it.  I miss  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !!

Great vegetarian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is great and diverse, and is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  very close to McGill. I really enjoyed eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ; however it is very popular and is often crowded. On the plus side, you can make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> .

The  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was similar to what I have experienced at many other steakhouses.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is way  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is marginal.  We went for the 45 dry aged Porterhouse  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and it arrived  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  very well but lacking in seasoning and all of the character you come to expect and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for in a dry aged  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  The sides were very average as well.  The one good thing was the  <START:Service> service <END> .  We had a big group and they handled everything well.  Definitely not the best choice in Montreal.

I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and will never go back again. I thought the combinations on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  were kind of bizarre- having some  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  on the side- but maybe that's just me, too much carbs and  <START:F_Ingredients> starch <END>  on one plate is kind of off-putting. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had some choices that sounded good, but that's it. I ordered a 'make your own  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> ', which had penne, mixed  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> , and rose  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . When my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  arrived, it was not what I was expecting. Way too much  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , and not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> -  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were maybe 2 florets each of  <START:F_Ingredients> broccoli <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END> , and maybe 3 pieces each of red and  <START:F_Ingredients> green peppers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  didn't even seem  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was doused in  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and was not very pleasant to eat.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so much  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , it could have been split between 2-3 people. I noticed all the  <START:Food> food <END>  going out looked like it could have fed that many people. Why make that much  <START:Food> food <END>  for one person? i don't understand. Takeout the rest after maybe, but I certainly didn't want to.The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was just as bad- I ordered a mousse, which was much too rich, and again  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was too much of it.Despite the gross  <START:Food> food <END> , I think the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was friendly to me, addressing me in English as I was the only anglophone at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . I'd give the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  1.5 stars because of the  <START:Service> service <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  is memorable, but for all the wrong reasons.

Nothing like  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  a Metro.  Typical Scottsdale in trying really hard to impress with a look and not being able to  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> . Big  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in the middle seemed like the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to sit.  Weird  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  outlined the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with tacky  <START:A_Decor> curtains <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was ok but didn't seem to offer any real interesting or creative touches.  Calamari and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  were decent but were a little pricey especially for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  Nothing really appealing to draw me back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

Awesome  <START:Food> food <END> . Never had a disappointing  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  item. Seitan  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are as good or better than the real thing! Great take-out spot.

I'm under the impression that Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  in Las Vegas, but you definitely get a completely different  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at each  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .The Husband ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Katsu and Kalbi  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>  Combo, while I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Lau Lau  Their two  <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and one scoop of  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is an embarrassment to Hawaiian  <START:Food> food <END> .  When I opened my box, I thought they were kidding.  What's up with the  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END> ?  Definitely disappointing on that part alone.The  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  okay, but my  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was super dry.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were minimal fatty pieces, and everyone knows a good lau lau should have some decent amount of fatty pieces!  <START:Service> service <END>  can be improved  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The only girl working was outside  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> socializing <END>  with some  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> .  I needed more  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  and since they are behind the counter, I had to go outside to request more.  It seemed like I was bothering her.  Overall,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are way better Hawaiian  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Vegas that do better in  <START:Food> food <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> quantity <END> ) and  <START:Service> service <END> .2.5 stars

We stopped in during the festival (make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> !). The  <START:Food> food <END>  was very carefully prepared, and quite nice.  I see one reviewer was concerned that this is a  <START:Restaurant> tapas <END>  establishment (that would be the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  next door). No, this has credible Spanish  <START:Food> food <END> , and a reasonable  <START:S_Menu>   wine   list <END> . A fun evening.

Does Edinburgh really need three branches of I.J. Mellis? If you've sampled the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  they sell, you'll know the answer is YES. Established in 1993, this  <START:A_OutsideView> picturesque <END>  shop is the original I.J. and is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  halfway down the charming Victoria Street in the Old Town. It's tiny compared to delis like Clark's and Valvona & Crolla but they manage to pack a lot of character and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavour <END>  into the  <START:A_Places> space <END> . On a weekend it's usually crammed with tourists ooohing and aaahing at the produce but in the week, its easy to walk in and pick up supplies for a last minute picnic.On those rare occasions, my basket usually includes a campagne  <START:F_Ingredients> loaf <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> rustica olives <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> grilled artichokes <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> parma ham <END> , Montgomery Cheddar, Ragstone goats  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and some Mrs Kirkham Lancashire.

Tried this after the reviews on Yelp.  Had a bit of a Wait on a Saturday morning, but we expect that.  They told us 10-15 minutes, but it actually was more like 25 minutes.  While we were  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  we saw someone slip the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  $20 to skip the line - not cool !  Once  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  (inside as we took first available) our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  came over very quickly and took our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  order and then our full order - we got our  <START:Food> food <END>  very quickly considering how busy it was.  The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very friendly and gave us suggestions on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  since this was our first time  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I had the Caprese omelet, which was excellent - my partner had the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry <END>  pancakes and said they were good too.  It was a little noisy inside, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent and we will be back.

One of my favorite  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  cafés to visit! This morning our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  DONNA was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and polite. She immediately noticed  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:F_Ingredients> creamer <END>  left on our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and was quick to bring more for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,she also brought me a new  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  right away. It's not easy to find great  <START:Service> service <END>  in a busy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,but I am very pleased with everything  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  including the  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  omelet is a fantastic choice! The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is amazing & they bring you your own pot to pour from instead of having to wait and hope that you'll get a refill. Next time you're hungry for a hearty  <START:Food> meal <END> ,this is the spot!

AMAZING!  My husband and i have been "take out" from  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the past year.  Always SO relish- and zero mistakes on our order. Always order the Pho  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> - w  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and an order of  spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  We decided to stray this week and try recomended Pho Lein which had great reviews.  SUCH a disapointment. When we got home, unwrapped the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  to put into the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  - it was already pre  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> ? UGH. The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was fatty and tasteless. Pho Bac- great  <START:Food> portion <END>  sizes,  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , and delish! Be prepared w/  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  only and time to look for  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> 

This was my first time eating Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END>  and I wasn't disappointed at all.  My husband ordered an iced  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and I quickly followed suit.  When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  I am used to very strong  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  so when I go out, it's hard to find  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  that I like but this one was simply amazing.  I decided to try the Pho with  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  and my husband ordered the Pho with  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and tripe.  I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  leaves that they give you to add to your  <START:Food> meal <END>  and thought the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  was pretty good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  weren't that great.  If you decide to order the Pho, I would recommend that you try it with something other than the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END> .  My husband enjoyed his bowl of Pho as well.  We will definitely be going back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  sometime soon!

 <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  Beware can be quite spicy.

Old fashioned  <START:F_FoodItem> hamburger <END> , tortilla  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  walnut  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , wonderful. Give it a try and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was only 2.50.

It can be lonely being a  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  enthusiast in Waterloo. For six years I've had to endure a city with a makeshift  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  culture. To make matters worse, my Coop terms take me to Seattle and New York to enjoy the best  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  culture around only to yank me back to KW every 4 months.Today I'm enjoying an Americano on King Street in Uptown Waterloo. Any other day I would be at Heuther's or my oh-so-favorite Second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END> . Not today. On the corner of Dupont & King  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  infusion of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  culture into mundane Uptown life.This new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  is appropriately called  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  Culture and I have the best  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  in the house! It's the  <START:A_Furniture> red   leather   <END>   <START:A_Furniture> couch <END>  in the corner by the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> . I can see the little old ladies in the street plastering their faces into the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  wondering what this new  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is. After walking away they are back literally 10 minutes later with their husbands to try it out.  The lineup was short but the wait time was long. The  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was new so I forgive him. I took in the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  instead. Oddly it's spread out the whole length of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  making it hard to read everything while standing in line. After ordering and taking my super awesome  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> barista <END>  came by. She asked me exactly how much  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  I'd like in my Americano. It might not seem like  <START:O_Experience> special <END>  treatment but it is. The last time I had this custom a  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  made for me it was at bauhaus in trendy hipster Seattle.The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are low  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  to fair  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I have a feeling they will rise to match everyone.  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  shops are always  <START:W_Price> more expensive <END>  to run than initially thought as well. Still, they are definitely competitive with Starbucks, Second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END> , Heuther  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and even Timmies. They have plenty of  <START:Food> food <END> . If I had  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to spare I'd try it out. Though, the smell of it is enough to convince me to come back!The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is sparkling clean. Sure to please my parents when they come for a visit. They never did like the grungy hipster makeshift house  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> 's I generally drag them to. The  <START:A_Furniture> couches <END>  are  <START:A_Furniture> leather <END>  and the  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  and  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  real wood - not plasticy Timmies style - though you knew that by now. They even have a nice big screen  <START:A_Ent_Tv> television <END>  so I can enjoy a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  while getting some work done - free  <START:S_Wifi> wifi <END>  hurrah!Oh look, even a cop walked in to try it out. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is destined for greatness :p So long Timmies and good riddance.One new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  may not be enough to turn KW into a thriving cosmopolitan city overnight. But with a new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , I feel better that  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  enthusiasts in KW aren't a dying species like first thought.

How can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ? I've been telling myself I'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that I keep losing. Since this shop is in the same complex as a  Gold's Gym - that's a good enough excuse to indulge in sweet  <START:Service> treats <END> , right?The shop is so cute. Black and white  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  and the  <START:A_Decor> colors <END>  come from the beautiful  <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END> ,  <START:Food> pastries <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . They serve  <START:F_Drinks> hot chocolate <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> ...and  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  (at night).  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  +  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ? Can I just live  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ? Before I continue, I must say that my love for  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> . These French cookies are my faves just like chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate chip cookies <END> . I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  in ALL their  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> . So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> . My true test for  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  is pistachio  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can  <START:O_Experience> special <END>  order items a day before.They have 10 macaron  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  at a time. I think 2 are seasonal  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> :  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Snickerdoodle,  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> , Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's  <START:F_FoodItem> blueberry pancake <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END> , maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , Snickers Candy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate-covered   strawberry   <END> . I got 14  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  - I had to get an extra fig and goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  macaron and 2 extra Nutella  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> . I also got a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_Dessert> fruit   pavlova   <END>  and a green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . As for the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's how each ranks:5/5:  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry4/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  bar3/5:  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> , grandpa's  <START:F_FoodItem> blueberry pancake <END> , birthday cakeGreen  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> :I love green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and not a lot of places have green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . The crust is crunchy. The  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  is deliciously creamy with a good green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . It's topped with a  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sesame nougatine <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> raspberry <END> . Amazing! 5/5Fresh  <START:F_Dessert> fruit   pavlova   <END> :A  <START:F_Dessert> pavlova <END>  is a meringue topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END> . It's  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> . It's like a "healthier"  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  if you will. 5/5They warned me that the  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END>  was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . Hooray for honesty! The  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since I love goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Sweet fig + tart goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were mild but really sweet. I think the  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  macaron. Score! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is amazing  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  an average of $7 apiece and the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  are $3.50-4.50 each - the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  are HUUUUGE though (the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of your palm or about 4  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> ) and the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are of  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . Hello? I don't mind  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for something good. You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in. And if you buy more than 6  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> , you get 50cents off each additional you buy.I was smiling the whole time I was in the shop like a kid in candy store. My friend who was driving me around even said, "see! It's that smile that makes driving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it".

So I had to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  cause I was starving and visiting my mother in the hospital. I gotta admit what I had was not  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  bad for a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint. I had their Spicy Chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . It had some kick to it and the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  was enjoyable.

I've been coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for years just because I live across the street. The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is horrible and the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  are definitely high! I wish  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  closer cause I do like the  <START:Food> food <END> . My rating is based only on  <START:Service> service <END> .

Excellent hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END> . Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and they were excellent.

Used to go to this subway all the time. But stopped going after I got extremely sick. They're  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  always gave off the vibe that they hate their job and this one  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  moves soo slow. Expect to wait a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  hour if he's making your  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> . And he also gave me a huge thick slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  (it was the end) and I was just disgusted so I decided to stop going their.

Good  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  when you're up to on the deck. Not sure about the inside as I didn't venture inside. Good  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and an extensive  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Had the wasabi tuna  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , and what led me to order based on the description lacked in  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . The " <START:F_FoodItem> green wasabi <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is very bland.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are s many other good things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  that I will be sure to return...I'll just pass on the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .

At least it has  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . The $13  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was about an inch below the rim of my  <START:F_Drinks> martini <END>  glass. I had to have that corrected immediately before the night started off wrong. The whole  <START:Food> dinner <END>  could be ruined but that  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  will not be. The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  were orgasmic. Not happy that they charge $5 for a ramekin of horseradish cream  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Had a  <START:S_Gift> gift card <END>  that could take care of the whole  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the idiot couldn't process it. He made it sound like it was my problem. It was issued by your  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , not sure why it was my issue. He actually asked it I wanted to use the  <START:S_Gift> gift card <END>  or  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  by other means. I just about lost it. I still have nightmares about the stupidity of that statement since  <START:S_Gift> gift cards <END>  are just as good as  <START:W_Price> cash <END> . If you work in the industry you'll get 25% off on Mondays after 9 p.m.

To begin, I am not the biggest fan of thai  <START:Food> food <END>  to begin with, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was great.  We went with another couple and seemed to order everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> , but they got a  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  that was great, the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  was excellent too.  I would make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  if going for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  as it was super packed and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is relatively  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> .

Its okay, I was not really sold on the whole idea that their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is similar to that of the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  from back east.  And I also don't know why they insist on giving  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>  with every order.

After giving it another chance, my wife and I went back. Instead of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  2 hours for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , we selectively chose to wait for a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Furniture> seat <END> . After 20 minutes we got one and this time the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great, not just good.

Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with good  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  is good and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> .  If you enjoy  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go.  We had  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END> , and of course some really good  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> .  I enjoyed everything about it.  I'll be back.

If you like  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> ...you'll like Seasons 52.   After my wife and I dined on the  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbread <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> trout <END> , we were convinced that in order to add  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  to their reduced calories, they poor on the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .I read a few reviews  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  that mentioned bland  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Possibly the management read the same reviews and asked their  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  to open the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  shakers?   It really spoiled what could have been a nice  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .And skip the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> .   Very over  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  for what amounts to a plate of mixed greens and little else.  IMO, True Foods does a much better job.On the pro side, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is very nicely designed with a pleasant  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and good  <START:A_Decor> lighting <END> .  And the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and polite.

First time for me at DiVerti  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  & Grill. Clearly a great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  being on the corner of University & Mill.  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is in the back next to Jack In The Box. Pretty average  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  inside. Very typical of what you would find of a campus  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Carpets been removed and they stained the exposed cement floor. 7+ HDTV's above the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  so good for catching a  <START:A_Entertainment> sporting <END>  event. We ordered Hot  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  to start and they were good. A few undersized  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  made it onto the plate, but no complaints. Entree:  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  w/  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  + jalapeno. It's a specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  of theirs and it wasn't bad. Different, but good.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were extremely reasonable and they had a deep  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of items to choose from.  <START:Service> service <END>  was good. Granted  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were only about 10 people in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but Bartender was friendly and made some  <START:Service> recommendations <END> . Full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and lots of brews on tap. I'll be back to check out  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> !

excellent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> , chat with a friend, or work.

I work downtown and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is awesome!  I've ordered both  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  - both fantastic.  They do all of their own  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  grinding and seasoning of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and it's  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  The  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  area is really tight and cramped but they just opened an upstairs too.  The  <START:Food> lunch <END>  time crowd is crazy busy, but overall excellent!  If you work downtown, definitely try it out (order take out).

The  <START:Food> food <END>  was surprisingly  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was impeccable.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a little high for what you get but all in all a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  we will be back for sure.

We go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  about once a week for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very friendly and efficient.  They take the time to get to know the customers and know when to look for a refill.  Good, not great, selection of tap  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  - all good and interesting but not extensive. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent - predominately gastro-pub.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> slider trio <END>  is great and the margherita  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is one of the best in town.  We also enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> carne asado & queso <END>  dip.

We were torn between Butters and Butterfields (based on yelp reviews). Very pleased with our choice to go to Butters Pancakes &  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> '! Everything looked so good that we ended up ordering 3  <START:Food> entrees <END> . The salmon/cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  scramble,  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  rojo and  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  French toast (AMAZING!!!). Everything was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and well  <START:W_Price> priced <END> . Also really enjoyed the  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> !

Outstanding  <START:Service> service <END> , very clean. Ordered the French Onion  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Eater (roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  on french with au jous)Both were  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and hot. Will be going back :)

Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  bunch to get a good  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are not bad either.

 <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> flavored <END>  well.   We had good  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>   <START:S_Staff> manager <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  could have been warmer.

We were in Vegas a few days ago and wanted to try out Gordon Ramsay  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  so we called  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and found out they were booked until after 10pm.  No problem as she told us we could go to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  if we wanted to as it has a full  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  We ended up going to  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at American  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and decided to have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  at Ramsay.  When we got to the host stand we were told that the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was bought out for the night by a party.  This would have been great information to give us when we called earlier that day don't you think?! We were pissed but not as pissed as if we had decided to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  We got over it and went to Max Brenner for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  which was great.  I don't know if this was the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing but it left a really bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in our mouths.  Maybe we'll try it the next time we go...but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many other  <START:Food> stellar <END>  choices in Vegas.

I'm a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  snob......and I enjoyed this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was EXCELLENT!  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Ryan, was knowledgable with a great sense of humor.  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and big  <START:Food> portions <END> . They didn't skimp on the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  in our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Garlic edamame was very strong so make sure your date eats it too. We ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> albacore crunch roll <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> poke tuna <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  spicy tuna  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> lotus roll <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem>   shrimp   tempura roll <END> . Love the  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeño <END>  to top!  Everything was eaten with no complaints at all!

 <START:Service> service <END>  was a bit slow but the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  way more then made up for it.   <START:Food> dinner <END>  was okay. I'm sure I'll be back for football season.

I work downtown; been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  two or three  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  BBQ - Their's is good.  Good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , several  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  available, and the  <START:Food> portions <END>  (at least on the Plate) are fine (not heaping, but fine). I've had the Brunswick  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END> .  Okay, so simply based upon my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and input from friends, Brunswick  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  is usually thick and not soupy.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  is soupy  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  - i.e. it has a lot of  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END> .  But, get this now... I've ordered it twice because it's good.  So it may not look like what you're expecting when you get it, but give it a try.Collard greens were good.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  seems to be a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> stems <END> , but then, not everybody  makes the effort to pull some out.  Good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> !All in all, this is a convenient spot for good BBQ in the center of downtown Charlotte.  Fortunately for us  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in the queen city, we now have two options available!!If you do go, get the deviled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  They are good!One thing to note... if you order a soft  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , you're buying a bottle.  That's it.  So your refills are limited to your bottle.  Want more? Buy another.  I don't care for this approach.The wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very nice, friendly and informative.  Not terribly  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , but then they don't have to do refills either. ;-)So, I like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and will most likely be back.

During the course of  exploring the Strip District of the city I was looking forward to having a pub-style  <START:Food> lunch <END>  somewhere in the area. Unfortunately, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I was hoping to visit was  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  on Sunday (should have checked the listing on yelp!). I walked into Kelly O's (which must be 180 degrees from a pub setting) to find a bustling  <START:Food> diner <END>  filled with guests of all ages and descriptions. My  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Andrea, approached the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with 45 seconds and took my order. While tempted to have something from the Sunday extended  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I opted for a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  Pot Pie  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and "Classic" patty melt. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  arrived quickly and hot (and I mean HOT!) and included a nice  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of crust and chunk of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was also good (hot), rye  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END> , good  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  melt and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to the temperature.In spite of the business levels and somewhat cramped quarters  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no level of chaos at Kello O's. Instead,  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  moved about smoothly while  <START:S_Delivery> delivering <END>  orders and every departing guest was warmly thanked for their visit. The  <START:F_Drinks> patron <END>  mix ranged from children to folks well into their 80's. And,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an obvious mix of " <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END> " and first timers like me. Andrea was conversational, refilled my beverage without request and provided me with much appreciated information about the District. By the way, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,including  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END> , was remarkably clean which is saying plenty when considering the number of people that obviously went through the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . It's nice to visit a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that doesn't try to be "something they're not." The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is straightforward and genuine, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is "as promised," the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and connected with their customers.  I'll likely visit again with friends and family.

Tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back.Not bad, but for their high  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are better choices in LV.Noise level is high.

What I Learned From My Bacchanal  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>                                                               by Lori R    1)  If you want the SUPER Bacchanal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  you must go after 3pm!  A lot of what I've heard described in reviews was NOT on the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  that we went to on a Tuesday at  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END> .    That being said, we also  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  of what others  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  at night.  We arrived around 10:45 a.m., so it was around $50 for both of us (before tip).   2)  TIP!  Add gratuity to that  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  when you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  it at the register.  They will MARK your receipt as a  <START:O_Payment> tipper <END> .  Don't know if that gives you extra credit or what, but they sure make note of it.  And if that's not reason enough, these  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  work hard keeping your  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  refilled and whisking away endless empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> .  They also take  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  and  <START:S_Cutlery> pepper shakers <END>  very seriously, as I heard a serious conversation that involved keeping track of whose were whose. (you have to ask for it, if you want them, by the way, they aren't on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ).  3) PACE YOURSELF.  They were changing over from  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  when we arrived, so they kept putting out new things.  Favorites for me were some Asian items...the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> green beans <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .  Also thought the sliders were excellent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END>  very good.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an awesome  <START:F_Ingredients> truffled <END>  potato gratin, a  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  tater tot casserole...a very flavorful  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  habanero  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  (although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was nothing habanero hot about it).  From the Italian section, not a lot was calling out to me, but I did have a  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>  which was good, although very big...a smaller one would have been even better.    Seafood was disappointing to me, as expectations were high based on the reviews I had read, but those were obviously for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  I asked if it was too early for  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs, and was told yes, not until after 3.  Steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were good though.   4)  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  selection must be different this early in the day, also.  VERY GOOD though, but sadly, no macaroons!  I tried a  <START:F_Dessert> passion fruit meringue tart <END>  and a  <START:Food> chocolate creme brulee <END> .  Both were pretty good.   So, to sum up my personal Bacchanal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , it was quite good, but being  <START:Food> lunch <END> -time  <START:Food> buffet <END>  eaters,  we have preferred our  <START:Food> lunch <END> -time experiences at both  Wynn and Wicked Spoon.

I was super excited to find a soul  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Las Vegas, just moving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  from Atlanta, and being a huge soul  <START:Food> food <END>  fan! I did my research on yelp and decided to give Soul  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  a try! We were greeted by a very nice  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  right away on a Sunday, so far so good! I ordered the Catfish  <START:Food> lunch <END> , comes with two sides and cornbread (cornbread is sooo yummy, prob the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> ) I really wanted Collard Greens, my fav, but they were out so I ordered Cabbage and yams. My husband ordered  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and gravy and Cabbage. We tried to order the ribs for our daughter off the kids  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but they were out of ribs too :( So we ordered baked  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  for her.  After a pretty long wait we were told very apologetically that they were out of Cabbage also. At this point I did want to leave, or wish I would have known about them being out of  <START:Food> food <END>  so early on a Sunday, I would have liked the option to try again another day...BUT after  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  about 1.5 hrs we stayed, and  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  said that she would comp two sides for us. We finally got our  <START:Food> food <END> , honestly the  <START:Food> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was quite laughable (maybe Ive been spoiled down south?) On the plus, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  but for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> / <START:Food> portion <END>  ratio and the wait I dont know  if I'll be going back? btw..we ordered the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  Momma : Sweet  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> / Lemonade and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  Daddy : Kool Aid and Lemonade..Really Good, but VERY sweet... <START:F_Drinks> drank <END>  all my  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  for the month ;) lol

A bowl of potentialOn blistering cold nights, sometimes all it takes is a hot bowl of  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  to purge the chills & rejuvenate the senses. On a quiet little part of what appears to be dead-man's alley, sits this cozy little shoppe; a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  of hope in the sea of darkness.Upon entry a fog of authenticity & warmth envelopes you, as the hosts so graciously  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END> , get you situated & promptly serve you. Observant, keen & interested; a cohesive team that works together as they shuffle around caring for Tender, juicy, flavorful, the karaage hits every corner of your palate in a vibrant explosion of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  & feelings, as it slowly melts in your mouth. Generously portioned & accompanied with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Should  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ever be shortage of  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in the world, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  would most definitely be my new vice. It oozes of authenticity, with an array of tantalizing  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> ; from the succulent  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , to the wafer  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  seaweed the fukumimi ramen is a testament to the establishment's commitment to excellence.Praises aside,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are definitely two major issues that almost made me drop a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> . Please do lay off the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> . I almost felt my tongue fall off after my 4th karaage. Also please cut back on the seaweed in the fukumimi ramen, that almost ruined the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as I was winding down  <START:Food> dinner <END>  (it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like seaweed  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  instead of ramen).Overall, I applaud the  <START:Service> service <END> , I shall plan a return in the near future.

Very good  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  always pretty good. Love the  baby bella mushroom  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  with sriracha  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END> . Sometimes  <START:Service> service <END>  slow but not a bad  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .

The  <START:Food> food <END>  is fabulous (I love the Gecko Burro and Pollo Fundido...and the  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  and cream--one word-- AMAZING), the  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  are awesome and their involvement in the community is so great! I love supporting a great business like this!

Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> brunch <END> / <START:Food> lunch <END>  this Sunday; I wasn't overly hungry, but luckily everything was made a la carte, and  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  fairly! I shared the  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  balls with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was sweet and savory with leafy  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END> . I often find anything with  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>  to be too salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  pairing. They have the healthy option to get  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  wraps instead of  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> flour tortillas <END> , and seeing as  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an abundant amount of free  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , I didn't miss having a tortilla-the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  was perfect! The free  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  also came with three smaller and unique  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END> / <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  that varied in  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and spiciness-it was awesome to have variety. To top of the great  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> , the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was amazing. I loved the  <START:A_Decor> high ceilings <END>  and  <START:A_Decor> stained glass <END> , a  <START:A_Decor> huge rustic chandelier <END>  and beautiful well kept  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END> . I will definitely be back!

Cute  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in an odd  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . Very accommodating even though it was the last day for my Groupon. Very friendly and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> -especially the nice young man filling the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> !  I agree their  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  were not the highlight but they have other, name brand choices at reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  was very good. Mixed bruschetta board looked odd because  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  didn't appear to be  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>  but the varieties were good-very  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> generous <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END> . Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:O_Experience> special <END> -carbonara. You could tell that was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  and due to the richness, I thought the  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was just right. Ate every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . Good find from Groupon!

Really good  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> hamburgers <END>  are outstanding.  Prime Rib sliders were really good but could've used a little more jus for dipping.   Best for last:  The Cheddar Ale  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is totally bonkers!  I've never had anything like it.   <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , helpful with the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection, and pretty quick.   The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a sports- <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  with a zillion TV's and a rambunctious crowd, but nothing I'd be afraid to bring the children to.

Excellent  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . Great  <START:W_Price> price <END> . Excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . Nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  Humari  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  if you are downtown! They literally pulled me in off the street and I have been going back ever since!

VEGETARIAN options in every  <START:Food> food <END>  category! Awesome  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> - (3-6 am and pm) where else can you get a glass of Stella for $3!!?!? Football  <START:Offers> specials <END>  during every NFL  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> ! Phenomenal  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> - super nice and friendly! Open 24 hours! And  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  served 24/7! My new favorite hangout! Great gaming incentives!  You must go!!!

Dickey's saved my Thanksgiving!My brother & I decided to do Thanksgiving w/ friends super last minute. Hash House a Go Go ran out of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkeys <END> . WTF. So did Mimi's  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , Lucilles, and Famous Daves. Double WTF. I needed Thanksgiving to-go and only 2 days to do it! Dickey's had 2  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  options for $49.99--Cajun  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  or Smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . Of course, they were sold out of the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  but they had 1 smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  left. I called dibs!!!The pick-up process was easy. Zipped in and out within 5 minutes. They're  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  on Thanksgiving so pick-up needs to be the day before. They're open late so I picked up around 7pm. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  is wrapped in  <START:S_Delivery> foil <END>  and comes in an oven-safe aluminum pan ready-to-heat. It takes about 2 hours for the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  to reach eating temperature. Excellent  <START:S_Delivery> packaging <END>  since my friend just moved to Vegas and has minimal bake/cookware available. I needed low maintenance  <START:Food> food <END>  and Dickey's definitely made the holidays a bit easier for me. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  itself was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I was a little concerned that the smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  wouldn't have the Thanksgiving  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  I was looking for but it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . Not the best I've ever had but very good. As much as I love cooking and being able to put all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  I want into things. It was a relief to not have to deal with cooking a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  bird and focus on the epic  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  of Settlers of Catan and Wii Tennis.

Just stopped in for my first Firehouse  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and I wasn't disappointed. I had the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on white  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> , a little  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> , and very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The pastrami itself was cut thick and also had a great  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . They have a hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  loaded with great, hard-to-find, hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> . The only complaint I have is that it does take a little while to get your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , about 10-15 min. Now this certainly didn't ruin the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  for me and to be fair, they were getting slammed with orders. Overall, it is very easy to recommend this  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  shop. I'll certainly be coming back...next time for a Smokehouse  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  & Cheddar  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END> !

I don't usually write reviews but today I decided this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  one :)    I just got the 12  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  for the family and I have to say, it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> , not greasy at all, coleslaw was awesome. Kids loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> biscuits <END>  ( I don't eat them ) but they said it was great. Also got an order of he butterfly  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  which was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  Definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  going back for!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is great! To be honest I first thought it had a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  concept and was a little sketchy but it's not at all. Not sure what I ordered, all I know is that it was one of  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and it had  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in it. Great new  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Definitely coming back!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is ok, had the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  taco, need a little more  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  . Can yall please add hooks under the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  for us chicks please

Another Uptown location that understands foot traffic. (I mention that because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some that never seem to have enough workers. I guess trying to  <START:Offers> save <END>  a  <START:W_Price> penny <END> .)   <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's always a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> rush   line   <END>  and this visit no exception. However, I was able to get in and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  in less than 15 min. Plus you  <START:Food> food <END>  is ready as you go along.Tasty options, and  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining room <END>   <START:A_Places> space <END> . I would go again.

A  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of Charlotte history.The BBQ is good, maybe not the best.I kinda compare the local que to Kyle Flethcers in Gastonia.This is alright but not quite Kyle style.The days of the drive-in or waning.Go here for the experience before it's gone.

*Sigh*  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  makes me happy! Did you know?! It TOTALLY does! Me and the queens made plans to have  <START:Food> dinner <END>  somewhere - you know... like normal civilized people. All we knew was that I wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and that we wanted something awesome! After looking around on Yelp I chose to take the queens to CBNC... "So where is this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ?""ummm... between 7th street &amp; 10th street off of Camel""Okaaay? The left or right side of the road?""I unno""What do you MEAN you don't know? Haven't you been here before?!""Ummm... no.""oh HELL to the no!"*the car then becomes filled with laughter*We passed right by it and then flipped a bitch out of no where and it made us fear for our lives! and then screams filled the car. Soon we were parked infront of a soon to be Domino's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and headed to the  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  of my lil yelp dreams... Only to be met with a 20 minute  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . We were then  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and I was left to fight off the queens who seriously considered going to Tokyo express instead! And then FINALLY our names were called and we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very nice. I want to say that it's the little touches that make CBNC great. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>    <START:F_FI_Quality> thick <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lemon <END>  wedge and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  sprig of  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>  in the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  pitchers. The way the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are so  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . She even complimented on my Japanese pronunciation! :) I didn't want to tell her the origin of my great accent...  watching Kill Bill a thousand  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> . She helped us  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . I wanted nigiri and they didn't have it. I was disappointed but still went with her suggested  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and alaskan   rolls  . They were AMAZING! I loved the crunch and the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . With the soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was scrumptious. We wanted to cancel our  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  and just get more  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> ! The alaskan was great as well. I loved it. Even the queen who never had  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  before liked it. After devouring the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  our  <START:Food> food <END>  came. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  soba noodle  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END> . It came with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  instead. (boo!) but the  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  was perfect! (yay!) and I never had soba  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , I usually get udon or chinese  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . but I really liked the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> spniach <END>  that was wilting more and more as  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  went on. The slight  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the sliced green  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  really made the  <START:Food> dish <END>  something special. I loved it. I am just so sad that I couldn't finish it all! :(One queen devoured the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  yakisoba  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  at once! I was able to sneak my  <START:S_Cutlery> chopsticks <END>  inbetween his  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  and I got a  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . it was CRAZY  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END> ! each of the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  had a great difinitive  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and yet melded together amazingly. I loved it. The other queen was pleasantly surprised at the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of his  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  plate. He couldn't finish his eaither but it was really. A lil too  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  for my  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> , but it was still awesome. We then  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bottle of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and a sip here and a sip  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and we were all in heaven! Talking to our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  about the Navajo  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  behind the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  who she was trying to hook up with one of us... but we couldn't tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with! One of the queens or me?! Said  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  never made it to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  - and it's just as well... we were in  <START:Food> food <END>  heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in! I'm a big fan of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now and am VOWING to take several people with me next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ! :)

We live by MOTO so we are kinda stuck when it comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  establishments. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  blows. You can tell it isn't  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and never  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  super. The Mojo &  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  are the only good things. I don't really trust a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that hides the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  makers in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> ...stuff probably looks like week  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  shit which it is.

I originally walked in here and thought to myself man I bet this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  people in the morning..I can see the shamu wearing  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  ladies gathered here in the morning drinking their  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and gabbing like little chatting Cathy dolls about the new pool boy, and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  dudes talking about their tours in Nam and the Korea and the few survivors from the big one  WW II. To say the least I did not see that but I did  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  it in my mind...suffice to say it was not like that but that was my first vision:)What's good about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is it has plenty of  <START:A_Places> space <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  seems very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and it is  <START:F_FI_Quality> clean <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are delicious with pretty  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Places> portions <END> . Not huge or anything but decent. I did think it was a little pricey considering I could get a bigger better  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  at subway for about $3.00  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in not bad. Run of the mill a little pricey. But would not be opposed to going here again.

A friend of a friend was telling us about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on Sunday morning, and how awesome their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  long for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  When we were leaving, though, the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  was easily an hour long.We started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , which come in an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , so we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two small  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> , with each one being a half, so we had a nice  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  to try from.  We got the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  came to under $80.Oh, make sure you sit  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> ... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  temperature kept changing in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , so if you're going  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck.

This is about as close to an authentic Japanese izakaya as you'll find anywhere. And I'm talking countrywide.  I've been to several izakaya in Japan over the years and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  just brings me back  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  immediately.   My japanese buddy in San Francisco is jealous of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to give you a little perspective on my claim.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is incredible and you'll find yourself hard pressed to try everything they have to offer as new items come and go all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  I recommend damn near everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  If something scares you,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  IT, and you'll be pleasently surprised everytime.  If you do try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , make sure you get a members card, as you will definately be returning.  For every 5$ you spend you get a stamp.  The initial card saves you 5%, fill it up and you  <START:Offers> save <END>  10%, fill up a second card and you  <START:Offers> save <END>  15%.  This is permanent by the way, you can use it for every visit.  SO GO  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ALREADY, and I'll most likely see you  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  as I am  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  4-5  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  a week.

Oh sweet baby Jesus, I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Retro  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  who does a Robert DeNiro impression, and amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> . About mid way through my (rare) petite filet the other  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> -I turned to my husband and said, "I want to give this  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  a baby" Because that's how good it is.  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's always a point where I start to get sad that my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  will be gone shortly, so I try to slow down. But it's too hard at the Golden Steer! I don't want to slow down! Nomnomnom.Forget the stupid fancy places in the hotels on the strip, the Golden Steer is the real deal.Go. Now.

I'm no Korean/Hawaiian  <START:Food> food <END>  expert, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has lived up to the hype.  Thanks Jade for the recommendation.  Myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .First off, the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>  is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> .  Not this  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> .  You'll get this as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , so even if you are not a  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>  person you have to try it.  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  (the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , being the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>  fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The  <START:Food> crust <END>  was kind of  <START:F_FI_Quality> thick <END> , but not greasy at all.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was delicious, great  <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>  and herb  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> .  A good sign of things to come...I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , super  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> really nice <END>  Kochujang(?)  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END> .  What set this  <START:Food> dish <END>  apart for me was the high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean  <START:Food> dish <END> !I also managed to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  my friend's  <START:F_FoodItem> bulgolgi <END> .  I normally don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> bulgolgi <END>  because it is always tough and overly  <START:F_Ingredients> sauced <END> .  Not this  <START:F_FoodItem> bulgolgi <END> , which is the best I have ever had.  VERY  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , and expertly seasoned.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  and of a homemade  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  Just delicious!Again, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean  <START:Food> food <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean  <START:Food> food <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go when you do.  If you are a Korean  <START:Food> food <END>  snob, give Island Style a try and let me know what you think!

So sad! This used to be one of my fave places. Over the last 10 years I've barely ever make my trip  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  anymore because I am steadily disappointed in the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  if  <START:Food> food <END> !  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is spoiled or scarce, spring  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  filling probably a week  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> .. So sad because they literally have the best pad thai and  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>  on a good  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> . Today I was craving  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  thread noodle so I thought I would given them a chance again.., once again skimped on  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  and yellow (how can you not make  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  everyday?) , and they seem to think  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  means throwing in a shit load of crushed red  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  which adds no  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  or  <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>  just stomache irritation,. I'm so sad to say, after over 10 years this my last straw. Sad because  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's so much potential if they took the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .

Easily the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Madison.

Let me start by saying this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is REALLY hard to find! Even with my trusty GPS I found myself walking in circles and calling, calling,calling. I've seen many complaints about  <START:Service> service <END>  on here, and while my  <START:Service> service <END>  was not BAD in terms of inattentiveness, it certainly wasn't normal. The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  both came over several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  while we were eating and at one point I just wanted to say, "Um, can we eat? Please? It's great...I assure you. Skidaddle."We had the Wildberry Pancakes with a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> . Everything was good but for what we got, I consider the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  steep. $12.50 for 2 pancakes?? Yes, they were good, but why not 3 with a little more topping? My $4 side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  was 3  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  and maybe 1/4 cup of  <START:F_FoodItem> apples <END> . Lame. It's good but I'm not sure if I would return, at least on a  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  when I was really hungry.

I've gone here twice in the 3 days since I moved to Tempe and am extremely grateful to have found this gem (thanks Yelp!).  I eat between 5-10  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  a week and have no doubt that I will be getting several of those from Dilly's.The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , I was a bit put off by the thickness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ;  I did not want the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to overwhelm or disguise the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> /cheeses/ <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  (foccacia) was actually quite soft and complemented the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  (the Smokey Mountain) quite well.  Nonetheless, I would warn that if you really are opposed to eating a relatively  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , you might prefer something else, or perhaps one of the wraps offered here (though I haven't tried any of those yet).Also, it'd be nice if  <START:F_FI_Healthy> nutritional <END>  information were made available on the website.  One of the hibernate reasons that 80% of my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  consumption has been at Subway/Cosi/Potbelly is that I know the  <START:F_FI_Healthy> nutritional <END>  content of what I'm eating.  I hope to come here as many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  as possible before the ASU onslaught begins in a few weeks...I hope the lines aren't out the door when classes start...although I suppose I will just eat  <START:Food> lunch <END>  at 2 if that's the case.

With all that hype about this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , I was excited about going  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . But hmm it was just... how can I put it? Meh! Didn't do it for me. I would rather go to Daphne's.

When it comes to  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:Food> lunches <END>  on the westside of town, nothing beats Thai BBQ on Jones. Many a  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  have coworkers and I stopped in for a great  <START:Food> meal <END>  on the  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> . Have tried it a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  of  <START:Food> lunch <END>  which just means the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are a little  <START:F_FI_Size> larger <END>  and  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  higher but still great Thai  <START:Food> food <END> . Oh... and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is awesome! The only thing I have against this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is their  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  weird to me, but things like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  in my sprite are all good. Odd.... Maybe it is just me.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was horrible! I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  200 dollars for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  for two, my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was still mooing! If you are in Vegas and want a real  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse does it right!

Thank you Yolinda for always making me and my guest  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  to your  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .It's always nice to come to this fabulous  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for business meeting with my clients. The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  is always excellent, and of course, my guest was amazed by the selection of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  you always have to offer.Keep up the good work and always keep the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END> !!

 <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END> !  We stumbled upon this after attending an event in Vegas and just needed to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat.  I usually am so picky about  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  that I won't go to just any  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but we needed to eat.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was very good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  were tasty.  So much so we bought a bottle of the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dressing <END>  to take home with us.

Okay, so this was a total hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END> , but GREAT carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . I would  perhaps have given them  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5 stars <END>  if the 3  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  had actually first included the gacmole they were suppose to and the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was melted. But the carne asada was very good, almost San Diego-like.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  put the  <START:Food> food <END>  together in a heart beat but it was 10:30pm.  I have to say, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is in the memory banks...so close to the airport and the strip (if you have a car).  Just do this,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  and ask for extra gac and if you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  do the 5 with the works.  Glad I found this on Yelp and for sure  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END> ..oh and this is take-out only, no  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  really and not a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you want to hang.

Normally love Baja, but this one has been very disappointing.  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like rubber. All but one  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  eating.  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  are a no go, and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was average. My suggestion, don't let this be your first experience a Baja  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , go to another location, they do have good  <START:Food> food <END> !

I have eaten at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  twice. The first  <START:Food> meal <END>  was memorable and I never forgot it. As a result, I was so excited to go back last week. I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  for an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . My friend had a  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  that was the favorite of the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> 's but we both found it very strange. It was supposed to be something creole and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was covered with an unattractive brown  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Odd.We both had a filet mignon. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mine  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare. I couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. Disgusting. It was fine but not  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  $50. It came with a   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that made it delicious though. Without the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  it would have been a big disappointment.We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a side of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> double baked <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> . That was the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> .We each  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> banana <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  pie. It was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which I LOVE) but with little  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> . It was fine. My friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious. <START:Service> service <END>  was very nice. Overall at $312 I won't be going back simply because it isn't  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  the money.

Best  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in the Venetian! I am in Vegas for a conference. After realizing the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  at Lavo would take at least an hour (per the bouncer) despite the fact that our group had rented out the  <START:A_Places> space <END> , I checked Yelp and found the VIP  <START:S_Staff> managers <END>  (Jorge) personal number. After a few extremely helpful texts assuring us no cover, a bunch of us headed over  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , tweeting that we were going and for the rest of our group to follow. Michelle at the door was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> really nice <END>  and let us right in. All toll about 50 of us ended up  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and had a great  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> ! The  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are extremely reasonable for this casino ($8 for a rum and  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> , $8 for  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , etc) and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is hookah for a respectable $25. The DJ was great and had us all dancing. I was blown away by how much the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  went out of their way for our group and truly saved our  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> !

Not much to say about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ... the  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is hip and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is good but unfortunately, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is pedestrian and while  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a lot of fancy Mexican  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  verbage on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , it's still pretty straight forward typical Americanized-Mexican fare.   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> , tamales, combo  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END>  etc.  I can get this kind of  <START:Food> food <END>  in my suburban home town that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better and  <START:W_Price> cost. <END>  a lot less.  Even the highly-rated  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> -side  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  was just ok ...  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's just too much stuff in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Could all of this be smoothed over by a nice  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END> ?  Well, I will never know because mine was too sweet.  Overall, a disappointment.

I've been to the House of Blues for a few concerts now, and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are plenty of other venues that offer a better sound  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , especially in Las Vegas. If you have the opportunity to see a band at another venue, I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  it. The sound  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is awful, so  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  will be a very low chance you'll understand anything coming out of the singers mouth. It ends up being just a muffle that fades into the rest of the band.

The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is great and just shy of being too hip. Waitstaff was super  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> --felt like I was eating at a friend's house, but guess that's the point.Limoncello and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were great. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  suggested we get the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  one over  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> . You should try it.Didn't try the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We'll be back.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has definitely improved. I remember the early days of soggy crusts,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , subpar  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  and heartburn.  This is certainly no longer the case.The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was super jammed around 6pm on a Thursday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> .  It was actually kind of exciting!  All the  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  in back were having a good ol'  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and the gals up front taking the  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  were visibly stressed, but doing a great job.  We ended up creating our own  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  We kept it simple, and just added  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> .  It's everyone's new favorite... in fact, I've been  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the same combination at other  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  places, but it's not nearly as  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  as Mamma Mia's version.  They have a great selection to build your own, however I'm sure that all their offerings are a hit as evidenced by the long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  of hungry  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  lovers going out the door.

I've been to  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  at other casinos, but this is the best by far! Lots of  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:Food> seafood <END> , great carving stations, however I was not a fan of the way the prime rib was seasoned, and great  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> !

At first I was disappointed with Padre's  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I usually get  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> , and they only had soft  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> .  But then I ventured out and got this amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  that came with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  Really glad I tried it.I was also pleased to see that they had Sol  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  It is my favorite Mexican cerveza, and I usually can't find it in  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .

Great  <START:Food> food <END> ! Best  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  I've ever had. Get the nachos, you won't be disappointed! 10x better than Roberto's!

Awesome  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> ! Their microbrewed  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  are a mere $2 a pint from 3-6pm Monday through Friday (excluding holidays and Monday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  Football.) They also have $2 well  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  as well as a great selection of  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  for $4.50. I had an IPA and a Santa Klaas Holiday Ale which was specially brewed for the holiday season. This was a very dark ale that is made with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cocoa <END>  nibs. It was a delicious and different  <START:F_FI_Taste> bittersweet <END>  ale with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  overtones. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and fantastic!We were only  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  this trip but will definitely return for more awesome  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and to try some of the  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END> !

Think New Jersey  <START:Food> diner <END>  size  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , lots and lots of  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  covering most major  <START:Food> food <END>  groupings.  I had an LTO special called drunken  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  which had a pleasant  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and was served over potato cakes.   Very generous  <START:F_FI_Size> in size <END>  and I enjoyed it.  We also tried the rib's which turned out to be very decent considering it is a chain  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with a broad  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was very good and the store had a good sized  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>  eating area.  Would certainly go again if in the area.

You know how sometimes a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has such an impact on you that you start writing a review in your head as soon as you put something in your mouth? That happened and zero stars should be a thing.I decided to give this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  a chance since a client had booked rooms for my coworker and I at Excalibur, and after getting up 6am for the flight and working until 7pm that  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , we were both exhausted and didn't want to go very far for  <START:Food> food <END> . Big mistake. No matter how tired or hungry you think you are, you are NOT desperate enough to eat here. I would have preferred walking back to LA.The selection was awful, all the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was dry, the  <START:Food> seafood <END>  looked sketchy enough that I was too scared of potential  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END>  to try anything, and a lot of items at the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  were browning. All I ended up eating was a couple  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of potato gratin, and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Yes, this is  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  (only $22) but it's not even  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  that. I wish I'd just gone hungry.

Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is next to  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  N juicy. Not big, but not too crowded at  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is very simple just  <START:S_Menu> one page <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  soon  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END> , my friend had dolsot bibimbap special. Both of us enjoyed our  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  inside is also  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  is very fast too.

We went at around 5:30 on a  Tuesday  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was fairly busy.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  drop  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was delicious, and the highlight of the  <START:Food> meal <END> .  The only other two  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that were  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  enough were the Walnut  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> steamed <END>  clams.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a lot of high value items at the  <START:Food> buffet <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> crab legs <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and the like, but most of it was  <START:F_FI_Quality> dried out <END>  and not as tasty as it looked.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a wide selection ans some interesting  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> , like clams smothered in cheddar  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  I guess this is Arizona, and I should not have been surprised that next to the sweet and sour  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a tub of  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was also obligatory Chinese  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  I don't eat any of these picky eater accommodation  <START:Food> foods <END> , so cannot comment on their  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . They had a wide  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> , too, including a  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  i had the green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and it was okay,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a couple of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  crystals in it. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:W_Price> more expensive <END>  than I thought it would be.  I think the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  range should be adjusted to Moderate $$. I did not try the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  preparing it as we watched and it looked good.

Awesome  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are a lot better than most places,  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are good too... well definitely be stopping in when in that area...  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> 

I've been here twice now for the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  and the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I even brought a friend who was a foodie and both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  it was great. They have a great selection of dips on the  <START:Food> buffet <END> , a few  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and many  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END>  to choose from. I recommend taking a little bit of everything and if you follow my rule, you won't be disappointed. Everything is absolutely delicious and you'll have fun guessing the spices in the various  <START:Food> dishes <END> . If you're in the mood for some tasty middle eastern  <START:Food> food <END> , I would really recommend it. It's a little short on  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> , but with  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  like that, who's looking anywhere but their plate?

Went to Flo's  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END> , we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  and sour  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , which was very sour & not  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  at all; crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , which was ok, one of the highlights of the  <START:Food> meal <END> ;  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  chow mein, which was tasteless;  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was ok, nothing special; and moo shu  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , which wasn't good. The majority of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was tasteless.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were 5 of us in total, and we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $50 plus tip.

Gag  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> facilities <END> ; Sketchy business practices!  This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  deserves 0 stars. I was in Las Vegas on a business trip and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  It was dripping with so much  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END>  that even 5 napkins would not sop it up. I returned the entire slice  <START:F_FI_Quality> uneaten <END>  and requested my money back. The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  at the register refused and told me to come back at  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and ask for Pete.  I returned later and the  <START:S_Staff> female <END>  " <START:S_Staff> manager <END> " told me Pete wasn't  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and they don't give refunds.  After ignoring me for 10 minutes she realized I wasn't going away so she called Pete on the phone. He said he would have to mail me a check  for the purchase  <START:W_Price> price <END>  of the slice. Uh, the slice was $3 and, as you probably guessed, I never received the check. In addition to the gross  <START:Food> food <END> , I made the mistake of entering the  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END>  and the stench of urine and fllth almost knocked me unconscious! Avoid this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  under all circumstances!!

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END> ! I was here for a  <START:Food> lunch <END>  meeting and was  <START:Service> treated <END>  but I believe for the 3 of us the bill came out to $40 if you're trying to estimate cost. Note we were here on a Monday and they close at 4:00  <START:S_OpenHours> pm <END>  on Monday's.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was ample  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  inside, but I can see it hard to grab a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  during the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  rush. They have your standard mexican  <START:Food> dishes <END> . I was craving some  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Al Pastor Taco combo with  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . I was hardly able to finish but it was too good to leave left overs. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  too. Interestingly enough they were lacking  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  options and brought out a small condiment cup of Tapatio when I asked for some. Everyone else seemed to tear up their  <START:Food> food <END>  as well and seemed satisfied. Reason for the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END>  then? It's not the best mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  I've had, so I have to  <START:Offers> save <END>  the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5 stars <END>  for my favorite places, but for a lot of people this is a 5 star  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is awesome! I never have been a fan of chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , other than Panda Express, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great. I'd recommend the sweet n sour  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  :) And the best part is, they  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> !

I noticed a bunch of Pho places on Spring during my trip to Vegas this past weekend.Having partied hardy the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  before, our group decided Pho was definitely in  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .Maybe I'm spoiled a bit because I've had the best Pho in San Jose and Westminster... and so my Pho standards are pretty high.I felt it was an okay  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  at first glance:  <START:F_FI_Quality> clean <END> , lots of Vietnamese locals, and spacious.The pho was really average. The  <START:Food> broth <END>  lacked body and substance, and could have possibly been adulterated with some Swanson's  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> broth <END> . I hate that. The  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  were okay, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was TOTALLY skimpy in the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  in Pho Dac Biet, I got no such  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in my bowl and no tripe either =(I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some Vietnamese  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Sua Da) and it wasn't strong enough. They skimped on the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  grounds. I like places that prepare the french press in front of you instead of going to the back and giving you pre-stirred  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , but they shafted me on the strength. It  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down.I'd probably never come back unless it were like the AM and I was desperately wasted.The  <START:Service> service <END>  kind of sucked too. We were all hungover and needed  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . We had to ask 100x  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for refills!This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  kind of reminds of the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and even appearance of Lee's Noodle House in San Jose off of Tully Rd.... If you're from San Jose, you know what I'm talking about - this is Lee's Noodle House twin brother in Vegas.

Second  <START:Food> buffet <END>  stop in my 5  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  stay.The highlight of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  had to be the fire alarm that rang out in the middle of our  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Heh, dunno what happened  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .All that aside, the  <START:Food> food <END>  itself was below average to average. Probably the only thing I liked was the Har Gow. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was loathful; leaving it out in the open for what seemed like for hours (the colours look way off). I didn't bother touching it, as who knows what kind of  <START:F_FI_Healthy> bacteria <END>  has grown in those things...

One of my favorite Tempe spots, Forefathers really instilled in me a love for the Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . When visiting, I always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the 2nd  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>  option with white American  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , and either a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> french   fries   <END>  or their equally excellent  <START:F_Appetizer> sweet   potato   fries <END>  . For those wanting to manage their  <START:A_Places> portions <END> , their  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  also come in smaller sizes. After placing your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , be sure to go to the small  <START:A_Furniture> refrigerator <END>  across from the  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  machine and get a side of their sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  to accompany your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has great  <START:Food> food <END> , and along with it a comfortable, casual dining  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . It also has  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  ownership and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . It's been a while since I lived in Phoenix, but whenever I return and come to Forefathers,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are people working here who remember me and  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  me back. If you check out Forefathers, I am sure you'll want to come back again.

Interesting reading other reviews complaining about the  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>   <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  too. It is the hibernate reason I will never put my foot in Cafepino again, apart from the fact that it is  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END> . I much prefer to go to AMC  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  Ridge and have  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  half  <START:W_Price> price <END>  during  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  at the Yard House, where the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  is  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END>  and cares about his customers.Eight of us went to movies and had  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at Cafepino last month. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was okay but I had to cancel  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  because it took so long to arrive and our movie was starting in a few minutes. We were  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  long before the movie started to have enough  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to eat. When we wanted to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  separately because everyone didn't have cash, the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  scoffed at us and basically said he couldn't accommodate us, only one person had to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> . We were all shocked at how  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>  he was and decided to move our once-a-month movie  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  to a different location. Good job in loosing eight customers in one fell swoop. Bon chance!

Ever since I came here the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went to Vegas, I've been DYING to come back.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is so good!  I thought we just got lucky the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  thus far is DELICIOUS. <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is classy and cool.  It's a nice location within the Palazzo hotel with lots of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was also good, as my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  glass was always full despite being very  <START:S_Del_Time> busy. <END> on a Friday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  at midnight.We got:MOQUECA MISTA -  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> squid <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> roasted cashew <END> , dende oil, chimichurri  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA#T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uAThis thing is the BEST EVER.   <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  Thai-style  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  (hence  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ) with the delicate  <START:Food> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the  <START:Food> dish <END>  great  <START:Food> texture <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was served within the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  mixture as shown; the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> soaked <END>  up all the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , making every  <START:F_FoodItem> morsel <END>  DIVINE.  I thought after a while the  <START:Food> dish <END>  would get too rich-tasting, but somehow I kept gobbling and gobbling until the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END> was empty!EL TOPO  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  - salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf,  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  melted mozzerella,  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the moqueca mista)Very unique   roll   with interesting  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and textures = Delicious! <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  TERIYAKI - Samba Style organic  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , aji amarillo, purple potato mash,  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)When I saw the huge   price   tag I thought "WTF?!", especially for a seemingly simple  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END> as  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  teriyaki (my friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  this one so I had no control).  BUTTT I'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  I've ever had in my life!  Super juicy fillets of teriyaki  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  (I think) to a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> .  The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the  <START:Food> dish <END> .As with all finer dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , especially on the Las Vegas Strip, I did think the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a little inflated.  Hence the lack of that final star.  However, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in Vegas.  I'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  They have a good  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  too (both early  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  and late  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> ), so I'll have to take advantage of that next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ! :)

Just tried Create  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END>  on a date with the hubby.  Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to build your own  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  sundaes!  Too many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  for me, so I opted for the pre-designed option:  The Abstract  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END> ) made Renaisance-style (provolone,  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , terriyaki  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) on a Hawaiian  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> sweet   potato   fries <END>  .  Yum!  Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'd like to try the Portobello  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ...and opt for a wheat  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  and maybe get a little more  <START:Food> creative <END>  with toppings, but the combinations are endless...The options for the  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  is just as abundant!  Candy, nuts,  <START:F_FoodItem> berries <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> ...and of course the pre-set combos.  I tried the Berriesoho  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END>  in a  <START:F_Dessert> cone <END>  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END> , blueberries, blackberries, whipped  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> , and  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>   <START:F_Dessert> custard <END> .  I think it was the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  someone asked for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END>  in a  <START:F_Dessert> cone <END> , but it worked.  The only problem was that it was melting faster than I could eat it, but still very yum!Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for ppl who like  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  and want to be  <START:Food> creative <END> .  The people who work  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:A_Places> kept   clean   <END> .  It's a little too pricey for me to be a " <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END> "  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat, but I will definitely go back again.

I cannot explain how much I love the  <START:Food> food <END>  here, especially the Fungi  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . to.die.for. They have a great  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  from 3-6 and all  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  Sunday, which I appreciate.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is hit and miss.  If only they could be more consistent with the  <START:Service> service <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  would knock it out of the  <START:A_Places> park <END> .

Very slow and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> unresponsive <END>   <START:Service> service <END> , at one point the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  didn't stop by for 20 minutes.   The  <START:Food> food <END>  took over 45 minutes and was cold when it was served.  $300  <START:Food> meal <END>  for 4 people, better to spend your money elsewhere.  Only good point was the key  <START:F_FoodItem> lime pie <END> .

My partner and I went to Eddie's House prior to her  <START:A_Decor> art <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  opening at a nearby gallery.  We planned on Eddie's as a start to a very special  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END> .  We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  and it took our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  7 minutes to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us and ask us if we would like  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  another 10 minutes for them to arrive.  When he brought them he made no mention of the long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  to share and then a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  platter to share as our  <START:Food> hibernate course <END> .  He brought everything out at once which was not what we asked for.  We ate our  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and asked for the bill upon completion as we were leaving to get to the  <START:A_Decor> art <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> .  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> ...and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> .  I went inside to try to find him with no luck.  20 minutes later he brought the bill out.   The  <START:Food> food <END>  was average and over  <START:W_Price> priced <END> .  We were charged for a small  <START:Food> dish <END>  of extra pita  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to supplement the original small serving that arrived with the hummus.  All in all it was a disappointing experience due primarily to the dismissive behavior by our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> .  I called Eddie's House the next  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  to share my feedback and got Eddie on the phone.   I started telling him about my experience and he he  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> acted <END>  like I was interrupting him.    He asked if he could call me right back and confirmed my phone number with me.  He never called back.  I will never return to Eddie's House after this poor example of customer  <START:Service> service <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are too many other  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Scottsdale to dine in who  <START:Service> treat <END>  customers like they are  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  the effort to be courteous.

Went with  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and thought  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  a bit like  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . Overall, my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  loved it. I was just not too "Krazy" about it.

To be hnonest, I have only eaten here a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , but I ALWAYS use them for  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> catering <END> . Today was no different. Perfect in every way. Thank you Mitch( <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) for all of your hard work.  Great  <START:Service> service <END> , thank you!

What a great  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  find! I live just around the corner and was so exited to find a new  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go out to eat! The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a great  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  with an  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  Chevy Right in the center. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  could not be any more  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  either! When it comes to the  <START:Food> food <END> , you can't go wrong! The  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is to die for, and I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to come for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry <END>  granola pancakes. I give it an A++!

the quick and dirty - on a great placeAtmosphere:  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Vasco Da Gama (henceforth referred to as CVDG) has been around for a while.  A  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  that serves  <START:Food> food <END> , it's offend crowded with couples and  <START:S_Del_Time> busy. <END> working professionals - its a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to see and be seen and ironically one can even hide away here! (go to the back!) <START:Food> food <END> : Tunal  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ?! Yes please - a specialty of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , CVDG surges paninis,  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  that are both temptingly good and filling.  Never had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>  here. <START:Service> service <END> : since the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  can be quite crowded, be prepared to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  a little bit to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .   <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  are made in person at the counter, and  <START:Food> food <END>  is delivered to you once its ready.  Minimal  <START:Service> service <END> , but always pleasant and courteous.Pop in for a bit during the work  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  but my favourite  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to visit is during the early hours of Sat / Sun - people are a lot more relaxed and  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a general sense of easy about the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  as people are inclined to be a lot more mellow.  Summer  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  even bring a few  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  for some open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  render-vousYou should go :)

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is horrible, I wouldn't feed this to my dog. It is however tasty and greasy if you haven't a  palate.

This is such a cozy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! I had no idea it was right around the corner for me. 4 weeks into going Vegan and I was starting to feel like my only option at any  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  or  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . Not so at Sunrise  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ! I'm finding lots of other places offer items as well, but  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  need to be asked for.The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was delicious, and just as beautiful to boot! The  <START:Food> food <END>  was great. I had the Alien  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , and my boyfriend had the nomnom  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . Both made vegan. No complaints from either of us!  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are fair. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is adorable and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> ! Support local, and keep this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  alive!!

Mmmm I love Buffalo Grill!! If ever I am feeling in a serious need for some  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , this is always my first and last port of call as it always does the trick. Situated just around the corner from the hibernate University campus, George Square, Buffalo Grill is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for students to go for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  or  <START:Food> dinner <END> . I completely and utterly adore Buffalo Grill's  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  always ask you how well you want your  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , as it always comes out exactly how you have asked it to be done. I tend to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  their Diablo  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , which comes with sour  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and jalapenos  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  so it is pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  but amazing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  come in two different sizes, and I always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the smaller version as that fills me up and  <START:W_Price> cost. <END>  about £5 and the bigger size  <START:W_Price> cost. <END>  about £7. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  come with  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and, my favourite,  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END> ! Buffalo Grill also serves a huge  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of different Scottish  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  which  <START:W_Price> cost. <END> no more than £10 - what a bargain! But the Buffalo Grill is not just a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  eaters, as they have a hibernate  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  which offers a good selection of  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  too such as  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> 's and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict. A  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  are also available including  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pecan <END>  pie which is amazing. Buffalo Grill also allow you to bring your own booze which is a much  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>  option than buying  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . I completely adore this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and cannot recommend it more highly - GO!!

Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  in the UK has been grievously disappointing, both in  <START:W_Price> price <END>  and representation.  Gone are the days when $4 can score me a half-pounder cabaza/lengua  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .Tex Mex was the last I expected this far up north.  Scotland rocks.Let's do this bullet-point style:Margaritas - decent tequila content and thoroughly slushed.  Nothing more annoying that semi-icy concoctions that don't travel up straws well.Much respect for carrying Dos Equis, Corona, Sol, Modelo and that obscure little label Pacifico.Tequila - they carry the good stuff; these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  have done their homework.  Gun for the Anejos.  Don Julio Gold Anejo was my pick.Floutas - more like giant taquitos, the corn tostada-wrapped  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is deep  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  to crunchy perfection.  Topped off with  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , sour  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and guac it's what I'd expect to see in higher-end Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in LA or San Diego.Carnitas - the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was served in cubes and was much too salty, unfortunately. <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  - covered in a healthy layer of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  to be called such, it's an accurate enough representation of what my Mexican friends' moms would make at home. Approved.

I really wish that I lived closer to one of the Crackers  <START:A_LocatedArea> locations <END> , because their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  rocks! After a field trip to IKEA with my mom and sister we decided to grab a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat, I knew that Crackers had recently opened nearby, so we stopped by. The inside is very cute, feels like you are in someones country home. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has a huge  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> . On weekends, they serve  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  all  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> ! I got the Carnitas  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  skillet, and let me just say, they seriously have some of the best carnitas in town, no joke! The  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> ; covered with jack  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on a bed of  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , heaven! My sister got the BLT, and they were not skimpy on the  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> ! I have had some of their  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  before, and let's just say, the  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  & Artichoke is like heaven in a bowl! So rich, and  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END> , it is like eating dip without the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> ! They are only open until 2:00, but it is great spot to grab a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  or  <START:Food> lunch <END> !

One of the better  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  places on this side of town, good selection, nice  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , not too busy

I do enjoy the  <START:Food> food <END>  here . Finding good island  <START:Food> food <END>  like how you would get in Hawaii is state find in Las Vegas. My favorites are the Kalbi,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and the weekly specials. My wife insists we come every Tuesday for the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . All  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are ample  <START:A_Places> portions <END> . Most like you will have  <START:Food> leftovers <END>  for the  <START:A_Furniture> fridge <END>  tomorrow. The Chantilly vale is to for. The live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the selected weekend is a  <START:Service> treat <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  here is always on point. Keep up the great work it's like you on an island in the middle of the  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> .

Eh, but better airport  <START:Food> food <END>  then usual

If I HAD to eat one  <START:Food> buffet <END>  every  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  this would be the one I would pick..The long lines are a minus,but that shows others  [mostly locals] also feel as I do.

 <START:Service> service <END>  was slow and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was horrible!!!! With 4 exclamation points. We went through the drive-thru and the handwritten sign says pull forward to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , so we did. The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  didn't come to the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  for 7 minutes. Then he asks us to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  another couple of minutes to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . At that point we should have left. But I was curious as to see what the rave was all about on the Travel Channel. When we finally get our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  taken. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a Pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Not only was the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  long the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to get our  <START:Food> food <END>  was even longer. Total  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  25 minutes, no I'm not joking.As any fast  <START:Food> food <END>  eating American would do we pulled out the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and took a few out while we were driving away. Yes they were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  as expected. But they were so salty and hardly any  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . We were expecting minced  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and to our surprise it was only  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  salt with more salt - YUCK.The pastrami was very thinly sliced but was very fatty. Not typical of "LA Style Pastrami" as advertised. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was hard and not  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . Could it get any worse - YES, the pickle was not put in a separate wrapper as I asked, so the pickle  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END>  made the inside  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  soggy. I do not like  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  on my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> . The portion of pastrami was very skimpy. IMO - This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>  of any publicity on national TV. It is expensive and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is CRAP. If you are in Los Angeles got to the Hat, you will not be disappointed!

If you go to Happys , you become part of the Happy's  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> ! Great  <START:S_Menu> variety <END> , simple good  <START:Food> food <END>  with generous  <START:A_Places> portions <END> ! We love Leo, Donna and the entire crew. Try it you will love it!

Pros: Great  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , especially for AYCE!!  Whoever posted that their  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , are completely Wrong!  In comparison to other AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  places, they have  <START:F_FI_Size> very little <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> .  Great big  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , etc.  Maybe at one point they did mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , but not since Nov 2011.  Nice  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> .  <START:Food> lunch <END>  AYCE was approx. $20/person Cons: It was super super  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I had to go  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  a couple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to cool down.  They must have had the  <START:A_Furniture> heater <END>  cranked up. Finally told them about the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  temp and they were kind and turned it down (still a little  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END> ).  Also, the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were taking FOREVER to come out.  That was the longest  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for.  They were good and fancy (seemed to be made w/extra love), but if you are in a hurry, I would sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !  Not a very  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Not really good for big groups. Ok  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> -nothing fancy.  Overall, good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and would recommend it and would go back...prob sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ! :P

Thank goodness for good company! Though the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great... the rest was.. not so much. First strike: the filthiest  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  glass I have ever seen. And I normally don't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  attention to such things.. good thing I did!! Secondly, the  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dressing <END>  was quite odd. Not what Im used to, and very 'mayonaise-y' ( <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END> ).  And while the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were quite good, nothing stood out as fantastic about them. The  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  flakes on one of our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were definitely stale.  (unless chewy  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  flakes are the new thing...?) next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm in the Queen City, I will skip Room 112. Sorry (as for the filthy  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  glass, it was replaced even after the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  was poured in... the bottle was replaced as well).

The  <START:Food> food <END>  is just amazing! A  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is about $6 then you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  around $1 for whatever you want to add to the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , pickle..). $3 for  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and you have an option of  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END> ! (I recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  one).$6 for poutines! (which are really good!) <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are $2-$3. I usually take a  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END>  and for $1 more, I get a  <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>  icecream added to it! (just amazing)!

I have been to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for 3  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  now... Their  <START:Service> service <END>  sucks...  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  is worst... I had  <START:F_Ingredients> papaya <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and I had  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END>  and I threw up on my way back to work.... I am not going back again

Great hidden gem in  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  Town Scottsdale!  We had an Amazon deal to use and decided to stop in for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with our furry friend this weekend.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was so nice and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END>  to us and our dog on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> .  We tried a pretzel with mustard,  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  and mozzarella  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and a homemade prickly pear  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> .  Everything was  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and delicious and a perfect  <START:Food> lunch <END> !   <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END> !

Cherries has the potential to be a decent  <START:Food> diner <END>  in Market Square, but they don't quite  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> . I stopped here for a late  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and grabbed a  <START:A_Furniture> stool <END>  at the counter. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed, which isn't saying much when the max capacity is like 30.Anyway, it took awhile to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , even just to get a cup of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . It seemed like they had enough  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , but what they were all doing, I'm not sure. So I finally got my over-easy  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> yolks <END>  already broken),  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  (crunch, crunch) and  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  (eh). Oh, the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  was good. I was so hungry, I didn't even care at that point.So, I finished the  <START:Food> meal <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> ,  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> ,  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for my check. Thankfully, it was fairly inexpensive. I was happy to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  and leave quickly to find a real cup of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  somewhere else.

One star for the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  besides that the  <START:Food> food <END>  was really bad I got the grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sliders and they were just plain gross. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was nasty and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like it was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  in  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> . Harsh I know.

Very good Mexican  <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> , the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are a little on the high side but  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  it when you get  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  in all the  <START:Food> food <END> !

I've been to Mundo twice now, and  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  it.  It is a  <START:F_FI_Price> bit pricey <END> , but well  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  it.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was not great, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was fantastic.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END> , which was amazing.  It came with  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  and was quite  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> , which I like.  When it arrived it was still wrapped in the paper pouch in which it was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , so that was a bit of a mess.  I get it...  It keeps it  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  when you open it yourself.  But then I had this big  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of soggy parchment on my plate.  I had to ask a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  to take it away.  Otherwise, the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and  <START:Food> texture <END>  were superb.  Despite the  <START:A_Env_Type> messiness <END> , it's a  <START:Food> dish <END>  well  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> .

What a GREAT experience!   <START:Food> dinner <END>  was excellence and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were strong.  The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  is loud but you shouldn't be going here for a quite  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great for the beginning to your  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  out.  I recommend any of the  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  and the  <START:Food> seafood <END>  platter.

SOOOOOO much fun!!!! We had a couch under the awning across from the Dj Booth and right next to the  <START:A_Entertainment> gambling <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> !!! Perfect since we were  <START:A_Entertainment> gambling <END>  and Will I am was Dj'ing. We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  next to two  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  of peeps in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  30's-40's and we all had a blast!!! This is not Rehab!!  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was serious parting going on, including some slipping and sliding. The  <START:A_Decor> poles <END>  in the center of the pool brought out the inner  <START:S_Staff> stripper <END>  in a lot of girls who some how managed to have heels on up  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ??? The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were awesome and our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> 's Valerie and Will were so  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> !!  We did not meet the  minimum for our bed and she was able to quickly calculate the amount of shots required to meet our quota. again SO MUCH FUN!! I will definitely go back, you should too...unless your under 25 : )

Came on a monday afternoon for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . and it was delicious! I've only had tapas twice and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was not a thing we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  that was not full of  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and savored each and every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . We oredered:Tuna  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> : Sweet with a little kick. loved the different  <START:Food> testures <END>  of this dishceviche of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> : i didnt eat it, cause im not a fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> . but my friends loved itstuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> dates <END> : Hands down my fave  <START:Food> dish <END>  of the afternoon. it was sweet and savory and tongasmic.  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> dates <END>  and a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> nut <END>  in the center. How can you not love?? <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Empanadas: the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  one was great and didnt feel like you were eating  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  wrapped in  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  dough. it was smooth and great  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was good but the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  was my faveCamarones a la diabla: i didnt eat  the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  cause im not a fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , but the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that came with  it was  superb! we requested more  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and i lathered it up with the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and inhaled it! Albondigas: i love  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  but i had better. the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was a bit tough and not as succulant as  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  should be. but it had delicious  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . just the  <START:Food> texture <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  turned me offLamb skewers:   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was a bit dry but non the less delicious! must eat with the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END> , the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>   all together!Filet mignon sliders: yum yum yum!def will come back when im back in vegas!

My wife and I both lived in Thailand for many years and so we enjoy trying out Thai places in the Valley. We were not disappointed with Thai  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> . Pleasant  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  (just about the only Thai  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been to with tablecloths. This could be a mistake since the usual way to eat Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  -- passing around and sharing several  <START:Food> dishes <END>  -- can get messy). We shared larb gai ( <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  minced  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>  and other things) and green  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> . We can recommend both, and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was enough so we could bring some home. We had both  <START:Food> dishes <END>  at " <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>  10," and it was quite  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END> , the way we like it. If you prefer it milder just get a lower number.

well this one beats the other one in Chandler they have a few more trays and a nicer  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Everything I ate was real good from the  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  clam chowder to the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .This is my new favorite Chinese  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Arizona.A couple of things wrong were,my cake was still  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END>  and all the trays were not out at opening. They are new with new  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  so I hope they iron out these problems quickly other than that it was a great  <START:Food> buffet <END>  experience and I am going to put them on my top ten list for  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> .

Twist continues to impress.  Contemporary dining  <START:A_Places> space <END>  with illuminated glass globes suspended throughout, outstanding  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the Strip,  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  and efficient  <START:Service> service <END> , and incredible  <START:Food> food <END> .  What more can you ask for?Straight to the  <START:Food> food <END> .  The Hudson Valley foie. Presented two ways.  Poached (sous-vide) served with a horseradish emulsion, tart sauerkraut and smoky Morteau  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> .  A great savory balance between earthy, tart, smoky  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  all cutting the richness of the foie.  Second, "nuggets" of a foie terrine "glazed" with Glenmorangie dusted with sweet and  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  gingerbread power and hazelnuts.  The smoky undertones of the single malt accentuates the mineral, livery  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the foie.  Delish.  Apple  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  on the side; perfect.The Dover sole &  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  is hard to top.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  scented  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  ("glazed" with  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  cider) is brought to life by an earthy morel  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and vegetal  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of turnips,  <START:F_FoodItem> coriander <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> .  The addition of  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  adds sweetness and a nice oceanic  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> .  Complex yet refreshing  <START:Food> dish <END> .The list of great  <START:Food> dishes <END>  goes on and on.  The degustation  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  are the best way to sample Twist.   <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are scaled down so no risk of over eating (unless you have the six course grand  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> ).  Beautiful and delicious; just remember, you've been warned.  Note for  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  lovers:  Twist offers the best  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  Japanese A5 Wagyu  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Vegas.  Offered as a New York  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ;  10 ounces, $198.   Of course, eating this would be BORING.Multiple revisits, always a twist!

I love the  <START:Food> food <END>  here, is it better than In n Out?  Not so sure.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are definitely  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and delish.  I got a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and holy moly was it alot of  <START:Food> food <END> !  I think the little  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  would have been fine and I could have easily split one  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  with my two boys.  They fill up the cup of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , which is a good size and then dump more into the bag!  I took off one half of a star because of the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , I thought it was pretty pricey for fast  <START:Food> food <END> .  I also took off one quarter of a star for the loudness, I couldn't even hear myself think in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  because the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was so loud.  They lose another quarter of a star because they do not offer kids  <START:Food> meals <END> .  Now that I know portion size though, I can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  more appropriately because we had a bunch of  <START:Food> food <END>  leftover on our first visit here.  All of the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  are super nice and quick so all around I really like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and would return.

After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to try MM. However,  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END>  was my friends birthday so we all met here for  <START:Food> dinner <END> ...The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is very "chain like", not really what I was expecting(yes, I do know it's a chain).Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Ashley, was very nice, and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> . She didn't let any of our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  go with out refills, and she split our  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> 's check for us with out us even having to ask!The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good. We had the drunken fun  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> (?)  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Both were good, not amazing, but good. Everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  a little 'processed' or maybe just not very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . The  <START:Food> crust <END>  was good and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> , but had an almost  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwaved <END>   <START:Food> texture <END>  to it, like it was  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> ...I might give them another try, I just don't know if it's really the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for me...

This is a good Hawaiian grill! The macaroni  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is the best around. Support your local businesses people! This is the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been to in this area.

I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  until I had a few visits to review Cartel.Firs and foremost, great  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . I have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  lattes, chai, dirty chai, and the cold brew (toddy). All have been delicious. The ratio with the chai/ <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>  is pretty spot on and the cold brew is fantastic. I would say the cold brew is probably my go to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  from now on, though the dirty chai is delicious. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  has always been very nice and helpful.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  seem to be a tinsy bit high but the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is tasty so I keep going back. The shop is a littttle pretentious but not enough to deter me.Give it a shot, you'll love the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .

Nami is hands down my absolute favorite  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  establishment in all of PhoenixHere are a couple of words to describe Nami's tsoynami...YummyDeliciousWonderfulHeaven in a cupThe perfect dessertThe tsoynami's are  <START:F_FI_Quality> home made <END>  vegan soy  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  which you can choose several different topping options with... <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are several  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  as well as their own creations... They are all extremely delicious but I think my top 3 are as follows...1- Dough Boychocolate  <START:F_FoodItem> chip <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cookie <END>  dough and organic chocolate2-NO's 'n' Mintnewman's  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  O's,  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , organic chocolate3- Clunky Monkey (GF) <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> banana <END> , organic  <START:F_FoodItem> pecans <END> , organic chocolateThe customer  <START:Service> service <END>  at Nami is wonderful as each  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  is very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and knowledgable of the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  but they also provide very helpful tips Also, the cookies are fabulous, the cakes are scrumptious, and the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is perfect...

One of my favorite Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  places in Vegas!

Because I've changed my eating habits and have successfully lost quite a bit of weight, I try to eat  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  for my mid- <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . Today was an exception as  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  Craig wanted us to try out two special  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ...the Hawaiian  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and the Brie  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . My husband was able to try the Hawaiian last week, but this was my big chance and it did not disappoint. The Hawaiian is 100% angus  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  (I get the 1/3lb  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ) topped with delicious ham, melted swiss,  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , mayo and crushed  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> . I'm going to coin a 90's phrase that I feel is appropriate to describe this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ....orgasmic. Honestly. I felt the earth move when I bit into this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>   <START:Food> texture <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  paired so nicely with the sweetness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Taste> saltiness <END>  of the ham was just right. It was sheer perfection between a sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> ! The Brie  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is also 100% angus  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  topped with  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , sauteed  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and a slice of brie  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . It is also amazing as well. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  yet tart  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the brie really lent itself nicely to the angus  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and even though my son likes his  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  grilled well done, it was still juicy and flavorful. I can't speak highly enough about NY  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back later this week to try something new!

Went here for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  with two friends. As others pointed out, the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is beautiful, rustic yet classy however the  <START:Service> service <END>  was below average and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was ok.  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  forgot our  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , had to come back to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  twice to ask us what we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  took an incredibly long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to come out and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was only two or three additional  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  filled. We asked to have the bill split three ways, it took the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  three tries to get it correct. Overall, it's probably a nice  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to enjoy a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  but I would not recommend it for a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END>  out.

We stopped here for a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  because my fiancé is a HUGE Ramsay fan.  We got the American Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  sliders (wtf is that really?) which were about $18 for 2, but well  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  it (especially when our entire tab was comped by Trent's casino host).  The presentation was whatever and the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  was high, but let me just say that those things melted in your mouth. It was like eating a filet mignon mini- <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .  Fantabulous!  I wish we would have know that someone else was  <START:O_Payment> paying <END> , because we definitely would have sprung for the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Wellington for 2.  Oh well, live and learn.

Given the typical airport  <START:Food> food <END>  joints, Beaudevin is a breath of  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  in the midst of CLT's chaos. Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to spend some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in between flights.  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list is pretty good and the small  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END>  are perfect pairings.

HAPPIEST HOUR! We went to the Fleetwood Mac concert at US airways last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and one of our group had heard that they have an amazing  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> . They couldn't have been more right...They have a nice selection of draft  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  (not super extensive) but either 2 or 3 bucks at  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> , and some killer selections of  <START:Food> food <END>  for the 3-5 dollar range. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the vibe was great for pre  <START:A_Entertainment> gaming <END>  before a  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> . This is my new stop before any concert or event downtown.

My wife called to ask if they had a  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  that answered said yes, please see it online. My wife looked and when we got here (I'm here now lol), they said "oh yea our website is  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> . Strike one. Seaweed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  small. Edamame small. Strike 2 was when i asked for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  away from the front door and was told they were "reserved".  At 530pm!? ok !The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was average. Very  <START:F_FI_Size> small pieces <END> . Very loud due to teppan right next to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . All in an  <START:A_Environment> open area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are no  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  or anything. Strike 3 was when they brought out my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  with only half of the nigiri. Weird, if you write "1" for nigiri it's literal, not in pairs as about every other  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I've been to for 20 years all over the globe, does!Well I asked for the rest of the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and I was told if have to be out at the back of the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> . Meaning I'd be waiting much too long. Ridiculous. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was average. Very  <START:F_FI_Size> small pieces <END> . Very loud due to teppan right next to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . All in an  <START:A_Environment> open area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are no  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  or anything. Sakana and Mido are better in all ways. I'd be surprised to see them make it to 2014.

Fantastic! I've watched shows where the host goes to a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , tries their  <START:Food> foods <END>  and explains the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> , textures, and so forth. I never really understood until I came to this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .So I'm going to keep it simple: this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> clean <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . You can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  every single  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END> , layer by layer. A must go-back-to.

If you like trendy joints check it out. The one  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  had good customer  <START:Service> service <END>  since he switched an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to something else nicely. The  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  not that good. Their specialty are the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> !! You cant go wrong. The  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are freakin amazing! I requested for sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  ( <START:F_Appetizer> sweet   potato   fries <END> ). The  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>  with 3 strips of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was def not  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  the money. Coulda made that myself.

Amazing foooood!!!!That calamari is to die for, it has  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  jalapeno and freshly made tartar  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that has a kick of  <START:F_FoodItem> lemon <END> . The 4  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  is superb! It  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like a  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> .  calzone and when paired with the homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  it is magical. lolThis is not your traditional  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  it's  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  it's gormet and FULL of  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> !! The  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  put some high dollar restuarants to shame.LOve Love Love

Loved this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! Sat out of the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  today for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to watch some of the opening  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  Red Sox  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing.  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Ipswich  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  clams which were relish and straight out of a Cape Cod  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Husband had the Italian, which was enormous and enough to bring home half for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection - more than  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END> . I had the Lobster  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  special and was everything I expected it to be. Thanks for the Cracker Jacks Tim! This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great, be back very soon

I am saddened by the demise of this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  We walked in and had to "yoo hoo" to get  <START:S_Staff> server <END> / <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  attention. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was pitifully empty on a Saturday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  at 7:30. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our usual  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  satay  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  which was not "as good as usual",  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was on the dry side and the peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was lumpy. As wew  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for our  <START:Food> food <END> , I saw a bug on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  which i had to deal with under the weight of my flip flop. It was then that i noticed how utterly filthy the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  was.  My husband agreed, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had undeniably succumbed to a fate several ethnic  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  at this very location have suffered.  We pondered what else could be unwashed beside the floors and what else could possibly be creepy crawlin around the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> . I left with the heebie jeebies and we both agreed we would not venture back. So very sad :(

Whenever I am in this (LAME) part of town, I try to go to this little  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Today I had their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  with mole. Always amazing! Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and wish they would be closer to the west side!

We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 10"  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with gluten-free  <START:Food> crust <END> ... with feta  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . They said delivery would take about an hour, and they were right. We're literally a mile from them so that was kind of crazy but they told us ahead of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  so not a huge deal.I can't comment on what the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  looks like on the inside because I've never been. We'll  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  again but the lack of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  will ensure that this isn't our  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  spot. Even with us getting *extra*  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  still wasn't a lot. I'm a total cheeseaholic, so that was disappointing. <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were great, delivery  <START:S_Staff> driver <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . Can't really complain. :)

I REALLY ENJOYED THE  <START:Food> food <END> !  Very  <START:Food> creative <END>  Hispanic  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  as well. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is quite nice as well. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is brand new and has the formula down pat.  GO NOW GRASS HOPPER!

I'm just an avid  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  lover in a town filled with Japanese-influenced  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , but it isn't as easy to find a great  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for such a raw delicacy as you might think. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that has delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END> , scrumptious  <START:Food> food <END> , great and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , AND a vivacious  <START:Ambience> ambience <END> . Do i need to say anymore? Come see why Kanji has such a high rating for yourself.

I had  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  yesterday before the Pirates  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  with a few friends.  I have also been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few times upstairs.  I really liked the fact that we had no problem getting a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  or a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  I usually go to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  on the North Shore prior to Pirates  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> , but this was a lot less  <START:Ambience> crowded <END>  and good for the group I was with.  In fact, truth be told the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was only about 1/2 full (on Bucs opening day!?).  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was okay.  I tried these  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  which were good and interesting because it had a decent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  as the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and not just ground  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  I also really liked the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem>   potato     fries   <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and you usually can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  get these at too many places.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .  It was a ton of  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> , however some of the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  was a little  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END>  and it was  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold.  I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END> , but  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold really wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  that good when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  on it.  I also tried the  <START:F_Appetizer> tortilla   soup   <END> , which was really rich and had a good  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The only thing missing in the  <START:F_Appetizer> tortilla   soup   <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> tortilla   chips   <END> .  A minor oversight I imagine.  Overall, a pretty decent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when you are looking to just have a few  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  with friends.  I've also tried the upstairs  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  which is the more upscale section.  The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  including  <START:A_Furniture> leather couches <END> .  The  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 PM.  Overall a decent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for quiet  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  without the crowds and a little better than average  <START:Food> food <END> .

We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and only ate  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , but all-in-all it was an excellent  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> !  Craig and the other  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  (sorry i forgot her name... <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was very sweet) were on top of it, and  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent. The  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were good too.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  made our Charlotte  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  better. Thanks!

I just had  <START:Food> lunch <END>  at the Phoenix City Grille. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good, but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was not the best.  I got the Green Chile  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , and it was pretty good. We were  <START:Service> served <END>  quickly, but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  come check on us for several minutes. I needed  <START:F_Ingredients> mayonnaise <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , but I had to wait at least  <START:S_Del_Time> 10 minutes <END>  for the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to return to ask for it. I also had a  <START:F_Drinks> mimosa <END> . It was good, but the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  never asked if I  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> cared <END>  for another. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  only asked me if I wanted more  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  when it was  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to leave the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  It also seemed to take awhile to get the check and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for the  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was only moderately busy, and it seems like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  only had a few  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  working. I really don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  fault the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> . It just seems like  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was waiting on too many people.

Very nice  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  and a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to see live bands

************The  <START:Food> dinner <END>  plates are .......  a Good Value**************          The  <START:Food> dinner <END>  Plates come with a Nice Size Greek  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with Feta  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .          Plus a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  or French  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and Pita  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .      We've eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  three times ...... the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was disappointing.The last two times .......... HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING.The  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  are very generous .....and the seasoning RIGHT ON.                             My Wife enjoyed her Kabob ......                     My Gyros ...... the best I've had in Arizona

Of course if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  claim to have the best  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> -I had to try them. I liked the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , nice  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  pieces, deep  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END> , not too heavy on the  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END> . Although I found the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  a bit dry, and I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think their  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was  <START:Food> anything <END>  special-but at least  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ! I asked for just the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  charged me and gave me the entire  <START:Food> meal <END> , therefore only three stars...and my search for  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  continues.

We went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for our anniversary tonight . I havent ate a red  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  for 10 years because of how gross it was! But we decided it was  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  again after reentering the real world ( we justed moved back from the bush alaska) . And to tell you it wasnt bad at all. I really enjoyed my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> ! And my  <START:F_Drinks> alcoholic   drink   <END>  actually had alcohol in it

Ok, so I've never been a fan of Domino's in the past and I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  say much has changed since  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had redone their recipe for a "better"  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  is just too overly seasoned. That really turns me off. It  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put way too much  <START:F_Ingredients>   garlic   powder <END>  combined with Mrs. Dash on it, ew.The texture is ok, but it's really not doing it for me. I prefer  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  Hut or Papa John's still if I'm going for a  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  on the quick.

If I ever leave Las Vegas Capriotti's will be the only thing I miss.  This is the only Capriotti's I went to that had an actual dine in  <START:Ambience> sit down area <END> .  All the other Capriotti's I've gone to had 2 or 3  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  for their  <START:Ambience> sit down area <END>  and that was it.  I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>  on all of their  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  so I always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  w/no  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END>  since I'm not a fan of it.  My favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is the  <START:F_FoodItem> capastrami <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sla-be-joe <END>  was ok and the  <START:F_FoodItem> bobby <END>  is always a good choice.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have plenty of other  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  to choose from but I haven' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  tried any others because I always get the  <START:F_FoodItem> capastrami <END> .  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are a little more than what you'd expect from a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but I feel like it's definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it and it's still very reasonable.  A small  <START:F_FoodItem> 9 inch sub <END>  is around $7, a  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  12 inch is $9 and a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  20 inch is $13.  Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  you eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  give you a $3 off coupon for your next visit.  You have to go online and fill out a short questionnaire but it's  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it to get some money off for your next visit.  Other than the  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>  overload the only thing I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  close at 8 but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are still deserving of 5 stars despite of that.

After nearly 4 years I've finally ventured out to Chaya.  What took me so long?  I'm always mildly hesitant about  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  when I'm in a city not by the coast, but a man does what he's gotta do when he's got a craving.Three of us  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combination platter to split as well as our own  <START:Food> food <END> .  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail cheeks <END> , my friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  eel, and my last friend is boring.First came the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  It was pretty standard, but any sign of  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetation <END>  is a good thing for the college male.Next up was their  <START:F_FoodItem> karaage <END> .  Ohmygoodness it was the best  <START:F_FoodItem> karaage <END>  I have ever had.  Now I've never had  <START:F_FoodItem> karaage <END>  in Japan, but lots of people hyped it up for me and I was scared it would be a letdown.  The flesh was so flavorful and juicy it completely blew my mind away and left me craving more as soon as it was over.  Drool. <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was also pretty standard.The  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combination was a disappointment.  Yes, we had it coming for  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  a platter of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , but it was only b/c the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  platters would have either been too  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  (the 70 dollar boats) or too small (the 10 piece combo's).  In retrospect we should have just  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a la carte Nigiri...  I noticed halfway through the  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had Anago available that night too...My  <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail cheeks <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  Personally I love  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  cheeks (as well as the part of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  right by the tail when I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  whole).  It's super  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and rich and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  so delicate.My end of the bill came out to be around 30, which was perfectly.  I would've been perfectly happy if we had dropped the  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combination and I had picked up a piece of Toro and a piece of Anago instead. <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent and the their timing was impeccable;  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have it all down to an  <START:A_Decor> art <END> .  The next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm back I completely want to try their Omakase.  In Japanese it means "It's up to you" with "you" being the  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> I was slightly  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END>  when I saw my companions throw their wasabi into soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and completely mix it up.  That is not how  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  should be eaten.....

Cabo is my favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . As a  <START:Ambience> huge <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  lover I am always in heaven when I visit. No matter what you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  everything is always  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  items aren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  overly complicated and the featured specials are always a hit. Two thumbs up!

 <START:W_Price> worth <END>  every damn  <START:W_Price> penny <END> .

Who wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ?? The weather is  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  so we  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  Jimmy Johns.  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  it at 1:39...he rings my bell at 1:50. Needless to say the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great. From  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  to receiving its an all around good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .

very  <START:A_Decor> trendy <END>  mexican  <START:Restaurant> resturant <END>  that has horrible  <START:Service> service <END>  from old ladies who can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  hear or move fast enough to keep your  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  filled.  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  smells very bad.  i suggest a little remodeling along with some spring cleaning.

Since my last review I have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  many times and I must say  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  has improved a lot!  I really do love their  <START:Food> food <END> ... as of late I am stuck on their Artesian  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  Melt... YUM!  So  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get another star:)

Went to grab a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  yesterday with a colleague and we decided to go to Pita House.   <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  Mistake.We called in our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> gal <END>  on the phone seemed like it we were putting her out.  I guess the computer in the non  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  section (where we'd be picking up our  <START:Food> food <END> ) was down.  We weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  told how long it would be or how much our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was going to cost.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem>   gyro   pita <END>  with the house  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . We head over,  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  and get out  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  (the  <START:S_Staff> gal <END>  seemed irritated to have to walk over to the other side to run the card), and head back to work.  I dive into my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and something is off.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END> , like wilted  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END> .  Who wants to eat  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  floppy  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ?  Anyone...Anyone...Bueller?    My  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  was drowning in tzatziki.  I ended up throwing most of my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  away -   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no salvaging any of it.  Not sure if  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's new  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> management <END> ...but the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END>  has definitely gone downhill.  If I return, it wont be for a while.

Ive been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  like 5 times now and the only thing I get is the Danny's special. That's the only reason I give it a 5 star lol Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  speak for  <START:Food> anything <END>  else!Anyway, the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are AMAZING. I hate when  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are soggy on the outside,  but these are perrrfect,  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  on the outside but still smothered in  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I get the  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END>  and my boyfriend usually gets the  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are both delish. AND it comes with  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> !  10  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  & seasoned  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  for like 8 bucks, always hits the spot and fills me up

the outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  is great with the  <START:A_OutsideView> waterfall <END>  in the  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was mediocre, while the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  great, i would  <START:O_Experience> not go back <END>  secondary to the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END> . to note:  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve until 2 am!

Never had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Good  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is always  <START:Ambience> crowded <END> . Great for people watching.

I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> ! The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went it was very packed for the USA World Cup  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . I split the pretzel  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , which came with  <START:F_FoodItem> phenomenal   mustard   <END> . The pretzels were  <START:F_FI_Size> massive <END>  and really  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END> , soft, and great. I shared the Tap Room Tenderloin and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  it with Chipotle  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . It was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly and the chipotle really enhanced the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> . Would definitely recommend. Shared a pitcher of Sunbru which was really great and refreshing on a hot summer day. The second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went with  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  from New Jersey who are quite picky folks.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had just gotten in from a long flight and were starved.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were SUPER  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , both of my parents  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  flights and loved all. As for  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> - we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , which to our  <START:A_Environment> pleasant <END>  surprise were way  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicier <END>  than expected, the  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> artichoke dip <END> , which was filled with way more  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  than I had ever had, the Thai Hummus, which was superb, and a  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bruchetta <END> . Every single  <START:Food> item <END>  that touched my Sunbru cleansed palette was amazing. Not one thing was bland,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all kicked with amazing  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and combinations I could never replicate. Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to keep trying the great things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> !

For the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  and the amount of  <START:Food> food <END>  you get, I think it's only ok.  I'm a small little girl with a  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  stomach. I went to earls afterwards and put down a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , a  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and half a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great tho.  It's just a little too quiet in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for me. I almost fell asleep.

DEL INFERNO, MI CORAZONThis DT caught my eye one night while we were driving back to our room. Had I been driving, we surely would have been rear-ended because I have a tendency to slam on my brakes when I see their happy signs.Note: I only  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> . Whether I'm at Del  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  Bell, I do not stray from my simple  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> : between 3 and 8 crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> . I usually prefer them with  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and extra  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have to have 3 packets of hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  (I like to use one  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END> , one  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> , and one hot) and a half-packet of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> . So  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  we are in Vegas and I see DT, so of course (!) I made my husband park even though we'd been on our feet all day and were exhausted. We found a  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  spot several blocks away and walked through a detour for construction and around some dark corners until we were finally back on the strip and headed up to the  <START:Food> food <END>  court. A polite  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  gave me my  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  ($1.59 each) and the night was complete. Del  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  - please come to Walnut Creek, CA :)  xoxo

Stoped by with the  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  for my little sister's birthday,  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a cheeseburger and Mozzerella Sticks. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sticks were  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , also very  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The have these amazing super  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  shoestring  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>  seasoning. First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I've been to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , usually frequent Town Square but is very comparable.  <START:Service> service <END>  is very  <START:Service> consistent <END>  between the two.  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END> , good  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> , and plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> . A little bit  <START:W_Price> pricey <END>  depending what you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , but overall a nice dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .

Probably the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in town. Wood fired oven (used for  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , of course) also bakes their own  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , and wonderfully  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasts <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  for their vege,  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a nice short list of house  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> , or build your own to suit. Obscure  <START:S_Menu>   wine   list <END>  is fine, no harm trying a selection you haven' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  heard of before. Deserts are all homemade as well.

Best  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  I have ever had...the French Kiss  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  with Bailey's and Kahlua...and this is coming from someone who worked at Baskin Robbins through high school.  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  were  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> . My boyfriend and I chose the angus build-a- <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly and we really liked the ciabatta  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> . The jalapeno  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> . The  <START:Food> chipotle aioli <END>  was really  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END>  and good for dipping the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem>   potato     fries   <END> .  We will definitely return!

 <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> Colicchio, the naming of a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  cannot be more apt. And forgive little ole me for claiming that you, sir, got the craft of  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , down to a science. In my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , while other  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  excel on  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  typically fall apart when it comes to a collective  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  with the inclusion of the sides. Our selections of  the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  risotto,  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  gratinand Brentwood sweet corn had our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  clamoring for more.Oh, how I wish to revisit the evening soon.

I have been to the Great Dane for dinning and for just drinking on several occasions. I love the  <START:A_Decor> layout <END>  of the  <START:Ambience> building <END>  and the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . The Dane  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is great. I also enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END> . If you just want  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  I recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soft pretzels <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> artichoke dip <END> ! Of course you can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  forget the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sampler!

Maybe i am just a sucker for  <START:Food> buffet <END> , but i like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . It isnt the best i've had.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  dont have a  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  section, just some  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , and clams and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  ( <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> ), which are good nuff for me, considering the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . It is $18.95 sat-thru  <START:Food> dinner <END> , which is more reasonable than other hotel  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  in vegas. Friday night is  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  night, but i've never been. my Fave items  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are: Prime Rib (fill up on these),  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> cream <END>  sprinkled on top,  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> cream <END>  rotellini. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is decent ( <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  being the best) and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a "make your own  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> " Station, for the picky eaters, about 40 different  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  ( <START:F_Dessert> chocolate mousse cake <END>  is best). and the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , while  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , has a little funk on the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . It's borderline Chinese BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> -ish.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  should stick to one. A cross between  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  Kansas city BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and hoisin based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  isnt that great on the palate.Nothing much to complain about. Not too many people know about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , so it is never  <START:Ambience> crowded <END>  the 3 times I've gone (i go to vegas quite a bit my friends).  <START:Service> service <END>  is ok. And  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:Ambience> huge <END> , so you will be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  :)

I'm a little late on writing this since I was in Vegas over Super Bowl weekend, but it's still  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  writing about.This WOULD HAVE been the best  <START:Restaurant> steakhouse <END>  I've ever been to, but it sadly wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END> .  This evening, I wanted to  <START:Service> treat <END>  my gf out to a great  <START:Food> dinner <END>  before hitting up Zumanity.  As usual, we ran a few minutes late, but  <START:S_Del_Time> 10 minutes <END>  isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>   <START:Food> anything <END>  to fuss over at 99.9% of  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .  However, it took them over THIRTY minutes to  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us.  Umm...with a show we don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  want to be late for, that's some crumby  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  of  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .For the most part, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was top notch and the  <START:S_Staff> sommelier <END>  was great.  For  <START:Food> dinner <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the chateaubriand, the foir gras torchon, an iceberg  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  sides, and a great Bordeaux  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  was, for the most part, SUPERB.  Even the sides were as decadent as the hibernate entrée.  I just wish we had had more  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in the chateaubriand was juicy,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , and everything one could hope for as far as red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  goes.  The  <START:F_FoodItem>   foie gras   torchon <END>  was excellent, just a little rich for my palate.  I've had  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END>  every way you could have it and honestly, I prefer pan seared.In the end, we had a rushed  <START:Food> dinner <END>  because of being  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  late, getting the check took forever because of some "system problem", and we ended up being late to Zumanity!  GRRRR!It ended up being okay though, because when we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , one of the "actors" gave us shit about being late, but after we explained what happened, he hooked us up with front row/couch  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> !  Thanks, SW for the Cirque upgrade, I guess...

Spoiler alert: the bill is average $120 per person.With that being said, if you want to be a foodie...or at least  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> act <END>  the part...or just be  <START:Service> treated <END>  like you own the Bellagio for a night, come right on down.  It's located down the escalators and it will be one of the most decadent  <START:Food> meals <END>  of your life.I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  claim to know  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  or  <START:F_Drinks> liqueurs <END>  but I know  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  must be seriously good for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is great about suggesting pairings with your  <START:Food> meal <END> .  What I do claim to know is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do deliver.You can pick from 2  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> : the Degustation  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (5 course) or the Prix Fixe (4 course).  With only a $10 difference, I opted for the 5 course.  I will summarize because many have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  the gloriousness that I have and have lived to write about it as well.Maine  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> :  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  as in  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , etc.  Cool, refined, and accentuates the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> .  Not overly drowned in superfluous additives like mayo.Pan-seared Scallop:  I have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> ... but this was  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> -perfect, cut-with a fork, sophisticatedly simple. <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END> : probably my least favorite but only by personal  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Nice blacked  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  with a tangy center.  Basically blackened  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END> .Kobe Filet Mignon: yes ladies and gentlemen, I chose to add $160 to my  <START:Food> meal <END>  and try this heavenly cut of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  Perfectly marbled and juicy (recommended  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> -rare).  While I may not agree that it should cost an additional $160, I cannot deny that it was the highlight of my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and probably the best cut of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  I have ever  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .  Also accompanied by a the best ring of mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  but still no contest.  You can get kobe cuts across the street at Gordon Ramsay  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Paris and frankly better than  <START:Food> anything <END>  I've eaten in my life (until I ate at Picasso). <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> :  by now you will be full and probably not appreciate the choice as much as you should.  Tough choices... but if you make it this far, congratulations and  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's to hoping payday comes soon after this  <START:Food> meal <END> .Great  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ... <START:S_Staff> they <END>  know that for a lot of us, this  <START:Food> meal <END>  hurts the pockets, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> guide <END>  you through it and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  talk like all those fancy  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  in the movies too

Not the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was giving outstanding  <START:Service> service <END> .

Why on EARTH would  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> Aaron Sanchez put his name on any of the  <START:Food> food <END>  at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ?! Horrible! Tasteless! Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  waste your  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Perhaps as a  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  venue it is OK, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was disgusting. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Sure the crunch was spot on but it was under  <START:F_Ingredients> salted <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> spiced <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  itself  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like worn out shoe leather. I followed this by one of  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> Sanchez's signature  <START:Food> dishes <END>  - a half rack of  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> . One  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  into it and I was sorely  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  must have been steamed or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiled <END> . It too was  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorless <END> . To cover this up, it was slathered with a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  with hints of cayenne. This is not at all what I expected from an Adobo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . It was just straight up YUCK! I had it all packaged up to take back to my hotel and was SO angry I tossed it in the garbage as I walked back to my room. Shame on you Aaron Sanchez. Either take your good name off such horse-menure  <START:Food> food <END>  or fire your executive  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> and get someone who knows how to make it the way you intended it.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is adorable, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  give great  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . What's not to love!?

3.5 starsOur  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was incredibly nice and the Calamari  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Linguini al Mare and the description made it sound like  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  with marinara  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> . It was actually like a  <START:F_FoodItem> cioppino <END> , which is not my favorite thing and having the linguini sitting in  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  great. If you like  <START:F_FoodItem> cioppino <END>  though,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are very generous with the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> .My bf got the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  Orzo and he said it was way too  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END> . Still pretty good, but it needed more  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  or something to balance out the  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END> We were kind of  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> , which is sad because we LOVE this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , especially the one in LA.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is amazing! I had the best BBQ ever....the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  were do  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> melted <END>  in my mouth and the Mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was so good too! Highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and Donny,  <START:S_Staff> the manager <END> ,  really  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> cared <END>  that we were happy.

As visitors to Phoenix this past weekend, our group decided we wanted some  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> cuisine <END> . We found a review for this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  online and drove about 20 minutes (to what seemed like BFE) and finally arrived with hungry bellies. We were  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  by all 5 of the ladies standing near the entrance who  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  us quickly. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  arrived at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  quickly for our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  and was quite helpful. My only complaint about the  <START:Service> service <END>  is that my friend's father wanted to try their $4 Rita-tini (?) that was advertised on the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  that was made with 3 Amigos Tequila. When he asked for the $4 special, we were told it was strictly for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> . The sign itself said absolutely nothing about  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  - and the only reason I mention this is because every other sign in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  that offered a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  special -only for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> - designated that clearly on the sign. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  amused when he jokingly asked if  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  could make an exception. Our  <START:Food> meals <END>  were simply  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . The carne asada was easily the best carne asada I've ever had, and being from Southern California I would like to think we have quite the selection. I personally  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 2  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  plate, which included  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  differently from any other  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I have ever been to, it was incredibly juicy and surprisingly flavorful. I couldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  pin point exactly what the other people at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , but we were all settling into  <START:Food> food <END>  comas shortly after commencing our delightful  <START:Food> lunch <END>  (which wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  the best thing considering we all had a 5 hour drive to make back to California).If I ever find myself in Phoenix again, or even somewhere remotely close by- I would definitely stop in for another  <START:Food> meal <END> .

We went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at 5 pm for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with my adult kids to celebrate my wife's birthday.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great. Everyone seemed  <START:S_Stf_Appearance> professional <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .My kids love the Chilean Sea bass that was suggested by the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , we even  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the second one.My wife was happy getting an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from my kids a Giant Fortune Cookie with a "Happy Birthday" written on the plate.We went home with a good memory and would like to come back when we are in Vegas next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .

We found this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  via Opentable.com for our 10th wedding anniversary. The  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  bad. The Palms Hotel is not on the strip. You would have to take a cab to get  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . The average fare for a single trip: $10My husband  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  spaghetti. I forgot the name of  <START:Food> dish <END> . Out of world! Good  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> bone-in ribeye <END> . My gosh, the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was so juicy and I decided to keep some for home so I could enjoy chewing the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a trip!

This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is definitely just ok.  For $200 plus for three people I expect more.   <START:Food> food <END>  ok, nothing special.  You can get better at Wendy's Asian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on Spring Mountain and Jones!  And definitely better  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  at Raku.  Japanaise is a lovely looking  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with very cool  <START:Ambience> ceilings <END>  but it ends  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like having a paper overlay on my tablecloth or the fact that the busboy took my fork off my used  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  plate and placed it back on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  for me to use on entrée.  Also, one of the three  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  arrived ten minutes after the other two were  <START:Service> served <END> .  Wanted to be polite, so I waited, and then my  <START:Food> dish <END>  was cold when I got to eat it.  What is the delay in getting a Hamachi  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ?  I truly throught  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot my daughter's  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  it took so long.  I also said it was a birthday  <START:Food> dinner <END>  when I made  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and was told  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  acknowledge it.  Also whispered it to  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> .  Nothing!  I am local and think I expect more  <START:Service> service <END> .  I won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  be coming back for sure.

Goodness gracious alive, do I ever love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .I head out to U.S.  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  a couple of Sundays a month with my roomie and her pops.  We are  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>   <START:W_Waiting> speedily <END> , and any number of leggy beauties are at our beck and call for the entirety of our stay.  The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  is gracious, and the  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  are perpetually smiling.  The vibe is  <START:A_Decor> light <END> .The clientele runs from old folks to hipsters to the hangover crowd.  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has quite a bit to choose from, but I always have the  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  florentine (try it; i promise you won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  regret it).   I've heard tell that the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  benedict and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  over easy are remarkable, as well.   <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  leave a pitcher of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  with us as we eat-- <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  pester us or rush us or hint that we need to leave, even when our conversations run long.  I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think of a better  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .

The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is good. I looove the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> . It is young and fun. Yes,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is amigos... but a wise man would know that  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is not about that, but the dedication and love of the  <START:Food> food <END> . I eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  once a week. I do have to agree though that the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  or  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  are not included. But its good and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Service> treat <END>  you well.

I used to go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a lot for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  when I worked in Old Town, if the line wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  super long. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END> , all the while keeping it really  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . Everything I have tried has not  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END>  and the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is so good. Turkey club was my usual  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .

Sardella's does a pretty decent  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and with the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  it's convenient to stop in an pick one up on the way home. That's about as good as it gets. It's like  <START:F_FoodItem> rolling <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Size> dice <END>  when you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . You ask for blue  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  you get ranch. You  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  without an  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  you are allergic to, you might get the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  anyway. And honestly, how hard is it to cut a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think I've ever been to a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that has cut a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in a way that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were little triangle pieces in the middle. Not just once, but 3 times. Today was the last straw, I truly saw what was behind this locations issues. I spoke to a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  behind the counter that appeared to be running the store about my last  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  that was supposed to be half works, but ended up less than a third covered with  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> . His feed back was "yeah?', 'Have you ever tried to make a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ?'. Are you kidding me? I told him I was only trying to bring it to his attention and he continued on with 'Listen, I have to feed 100 people/hour'. That's a great attitude and clearly shows that  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Assurance is NOT Sardella's primary objective. Take it for what it is, I've been coming to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on just about a weekly basis but I can confidently say that I can only put up with so much.

LOVE THIS  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  i could eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  i always go for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with friends or for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> .  great for kids.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is grass for the kids to run around on.  it is like going on a picnic at the park but with great  <START:Food> food <END> .  we go about once a month! well maybe more!

 <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ..  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was helpful. Just made a quick stop before a concert with my lady. I will definantley try to go back next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i'm in the area..!!

I had the worst  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  skin  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ) in my life  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! It was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burnt <END> .... other  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  are medocre at best. Mido and kabuki are way better than this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

Pho-gettaboudit... not  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> , the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were over- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in the pho was no bueno.  The others at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  seemed to enjoy their  <START:Food> meal <END> , but I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're just used to being let down.Also, let me stand on my soap box and announce something to all small business  <START:S_Staff> owners <END> .  You don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like it when people  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  with credit or debit cards?  You don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  that 3-4.5% fee for electronic  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  customers?  Huh.  Well guess what... you should build that into your  <START:W_Price> pricing <END> !  'Cause guess what?  NO ONE likes to see a sign that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will be  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  50 cents or whatever extra just because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have cash.  It rubs me the wrong way almost every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  - and I know I'm not the only one.  So - in the best interest of your getting people to RETURN and RECOMMEND your  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of business to others?  Get with the 21st century and suck it up - debit / credit cards aren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  going anywhere.

My parents owned a Korean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  so I know good Korean  <START:Food> food <END> ! I enjoyed their Kalbi (short  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ) kalbi tang (short rib  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ) bulgogi ( <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  marinated  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ) tofu  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> mackerel combo <END>  and their  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  has been times where the side  <START:Food> dishes <END>  weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  as good. For instance the  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  kimchi was soggy and  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts were bland but the hibernate  <START:Food> dishes <END>  made up for it.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do get busy so the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  button that's on every  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  comes in handy when you need something.

The iceberg  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with what was kindly called " <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk ranch <END> ", actually just "buttermilk" i'm pretty sure....was sub-optimal.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  were good, and the special I got the night I went was freaking amazing.  Overall, it was a semi-quiet  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to sit and have a  <START:Food> meal <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were very polite and excellent, I was never wanting for a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , and everything ran very smoothly.

Chocolate  <START:F_FoodItem> cupcake <END>  - real good.

Sweet, sweet gluttonous Maizie's. I always emerge from the dimly  <START:A_Decor> lit <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  riddled with guilt at my lack of self control, but I keep coming back for more!  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is hectic and the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  remains consistently busy, but neither are such an issue that I would feel hesitant to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .The inside has urban swank and remains unpretentious. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> personable <END>  but not  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> overbearing <END> . And the  <START:Food> food <END> ...oh God, the  <START:Food> food <END> ! The buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip is cheesy, high calorie, ooey gooey  <START:F_FI_Taste> deliciousness <END> .  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  chunks of partially  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> melted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  swim in the dip, making it incredibly filling. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  pesto  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is way too good as well...thick cuts of  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , dripping  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , generously spread pesto and perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is amazing! What a unique idea. I love the quirky, well balanced  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is something to fit most moods and cravings. I need to come in for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and brunch to see what the day  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  is like, but I'm sure I won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  be  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> .

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is in the popular section of Old Montreal.  We had our first Monsieur Croquette - who knew a  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  could be so  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  We also had the  <START:F_FoodItem>   smoked     salmon   <END>  which was  <START:O_Experience> very satisfying <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> .  The best part is the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  from the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  for people watching.

We love this  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the best  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  in town and great  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  and selection. Try the Las Vegas  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> -- so good!

Absolutely amazing!!! We were 3 guys. I went with 2 other guys and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are both real foodies. We all said that it might have been top 3  <START:Food> meal <END>  of all  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . No one had  <START:Food> anything <END>  slightly bad to say. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  like champions. We shared 4  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , 2  <START:F_FoodItem> mains <END> , and 2  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> . The Duck  <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END>  was IMPECCABLE! Duck in a can was an  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and it was well  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. It is really a  <START:Service> treat <END>  to dine at a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  like PDC.

Very impressive.We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  overlooking the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  prepare every  <START:Food> dish <END> .  It was a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  being in the thick of it and seeing them work so cohesively - when it came to our  <START:Food> food <END>  we appreciated it even more!The  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END>  poutine was excellent.  My only complaint would have been to have had more  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> , but I guess this isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  necessarily a bad thing! We had considered getting a  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  (given the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  name involves a pig) but decided to go for Duck in a can.  Its unique and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .Would recommend going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you are in Montreal, but make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> !

Farmer Boys is OK for a change. Nothing spectacular  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , just good  <START:Food> food <END> , good  <START:W_Price> price <END> .I do find that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  slop too much  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  Not one of the top  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  places in Vegas.

I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  know why I was so reluctant to dine at the Nordstrom Cafe at first;  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  after  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  proves to be  <START:F_FI_Quality> superior <END>  to other local offerings, regardless of the particular Nordstrom  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . In this case, we were at the Fashion Show  <START:F_FI_Size> mall <END> , and I opted for the cranberry  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on the advice of the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> . My wife got the blackened  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  on a Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Both were excellent, and the  <START:Service> service <END>  as always was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> .The only thing I would point out is that the room temperature always seems to lean a bit towards the polar  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  caps side of the thermometer. For me, this is a plus, but be warned if you are one of those people who likes a  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  room.

 <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's not much else to say that hasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  already been said. Behold, the £2.00 sub!Serving up a lovely variety of scrummy fillings, All Good lives up to its good name by delivering excellent  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , soft filled  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and the £2 sub deal that has successfully bowled me over.Even during  <START:Food> lunch <END>  hour you will  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  speedy  <START:Service> service <END>  from  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , and plenty to choose from off their up-to-date  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Their website is pretty straightforward to navigate - fun and modern while also giving you some insight into the lunchtime  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Great if you're nipping in on your  <START:Food> lunch <END>  hour or have a busy day of shopping ahead of you, All Good is really good at spoiling us!

Everything is bad but the $2 Miller lites

Black Dog has THE best BBQ in the Champaign/Urbana area hands down.  Now all  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need is a larger  <START:A_Places> space <END>  to serve it in, i love the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  setting, but not one that has outgrown its  <START:A_Places> space <END>  because of how good their product is.  Waits are common of up to 30 mins anytime you go.As for the  <START:Food> food <END> , lets start with the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and the kick of the Carolina BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  puts them over the top.  My wife can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  stop talking about how good the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burnt <END>  ends are, and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  must not be the only one because the sell out frequently.   Loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , just wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had some baby backs to choose from.All in all you will not beat this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for BBQ anywhere within a hundred miles!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and a good value. Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  let the name fool you, not everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is greasy. Wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a little more indoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  so one could avoid the flies and the heat, but I guess that is part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's character.

 <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>  pho  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  I usually get the #7 ( <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chickens <END> .)  Although the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Pho is pretty good too.  Honestly, I have not been  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END>  an  <START:Food> anything <END>  I've had from  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  The Thai  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> iced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  is really good, too.  When you first walk in to the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , you may think twice - it is an old  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  bell converted to vietnamese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  But don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  let that stop you - the  <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent.  I've gotten a lot of people hooked on the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  - even people who are picky eaters and won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  try  <START:Food> anything <END>  "non-american."

My wife brought me  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  on a Sunday.  The Pastrami was  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> .  I believe this is one a a few different locations for Archies.  I'll be back......and I'll probably have the Pastrami again (that's how I  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ).

 <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  flies when you're having fun...It's been almost a full year since my initial review of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , and I've been back probably ten times or more.I've seen a lot of transition with the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  but I can say that their  <START:Service> service <END>  has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is right up my alley for a weekend  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , and my yogi  <START:F_FoodItem> omelette <END>  / protein  <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  have stayed  <START:Service> consistent <END>  too.  I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  earlier today and while the  <START:Service> service <END>  was spot-on, I did find a piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END>  in my otherwise  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelette <END>  - but I overlooked it and enjoyed my  <START:Food> meal <END>  nonetheless...My husband has been to  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled what's to come on their new  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (think pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ).  So, go for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , go for  <START:Food> lunch <END> , go for a Bloody Mary or a  <START:F_Drinks> mimosa <END> ... just kick back and enjoy your  <START:Food> meal <END> !

I love their  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! Even though  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve cold Dolma it is still pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I also like their  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with some artichokes. The  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is about $6.00 a pound but it is very filling and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END> . This is a perfect  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat for someone who is broke but would still like to have a nutritious  <START:Food> meal <END> .

This area is severely lacking in sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  choices, so this was nice to see a sit down  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  going into the old Nicks 24/7, especially because it seems to have taken them 1200 years to get this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  open...I had actually thought  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had pulled out it took so long.The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are yum.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  are nice.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have this italian  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  which is absolutely divine!  I just wish the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  had more side choices.  You get a bland  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> zucchini <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  at  <START:Food> dinner <END>  which are nice when  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , but if left too long before hitting the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are cold and floppy.  I have found the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  to be hit and miss.  Their tiramisu is totally delish!  And anyone that knows me knows, that if the tiramisu doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  impress I am hard pressed to come back.The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  sways between  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  or absent, guess its just the luck of the draw.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are right, and if you sign up for their monthly newsletter you get some pretty nice bargains.

After arriving in Vegas off of an early morning flight, we wanted to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to grab some quick  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and where we could enjoy the beautifully hot and sunny weather.  We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  fit the bill.  The second floor  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  provided nice  <START:A_OutsideView> views <END>  of the Bellagio  <START:A_OutsideView> lake, <END> and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!We started with some  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and queso which came with two  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  baskets of corn  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  was ok, the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was really runny, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were in  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  pieces which make dipping a challenge.For  <START:F_FoodItem> mains <END> , between us we had the Baja  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> , the jalapeno  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and the southwest cobb  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was a bit  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END>  and dry, but the overall  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavour <END>  was good and  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  featured  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  which was also a bit try, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  definitely weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  the best I'd ever had.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  looked great, and was a  <START:Ambience> huge <END>   <START:A_Places> portion <END> . <START:Restaurant> there <END>  definitely wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  any  <START:Food> food <END>  that would be  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  returning for.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a bit  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  for what we got, particularly the $15  <START:F_Dessert> banana <END>  mama  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  that was not that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way.I wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  return,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Vegas with equally decent  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patios <END>  that I would try first.

Really good  <START:F_FI_Size> spice <END>  level.   <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  plates.  Pretty mundane po'boys.  Overly charred  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  Incredible  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> .Cramped indoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  but still good eats.  Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you're vegetarian.

 <START:Food> meals <END>  were excellent!  Softshell po boy,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , all wonderful! <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were good - the  <START:F_FoodItem> bananas foster <END>  were great!Friday night  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  - it was loud but very  <START:A_Environment> pleasant <END> .

I'm very picky when it comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , but one thing I will say it's their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  delivery to my hotel room and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were right on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I had their  original  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were cut in squares no biggie, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  greasy their a little more  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  than  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  hut but it was all  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. You get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for.

Met a friend  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and we were both well  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and fast, so fast  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also cleared my chai before I was done drinking it! <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and well seasoned. Though you'd expect nothing less from this Italian 'chain'. I've been to La Favourita a few times, but this was my first visit to Vittoria and I wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  hesitate to return.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are reasonable for center of town and  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  too bad, tho it was definitely a 2 course  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Think I would have left slightly hungry if I hadn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  had  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .

Okay so I have been to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in Hawaii and was happy to know that on my visits  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Vegas I can now satisfy my tastebuds again with more of "Thelmas Special"(crunchy luau style  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in thelmas  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ). This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has something for everyone. It combines a great value on their  <START:Food> entrees <END>  and even better is  <START:Service> served <END>  up by some of the  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendliest <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  who really make you feel  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END> ! Give em' a try!!!

Went to the Auld Hoose with a group of Yelpers in search of  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> .  Well, it wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  much of a search, we had previously been informed that this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has the biggest  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  ever - seriously see the  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END> !!  So I came armed with a hunger to match.  3 of us shared a bowl of these Mega  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  that are suggested for 3-4.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came pretty quickly and looked amazing when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did.  Great ratio of  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> , as so often  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is just not enough.  Chilli  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END> , sour  <START:F_Ingredients> cream <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  throughout.  It took us a good 20 minutes or so to make a serious dent in the mound and start to get to the underneath layers, which were still hot.  After eating about a quarter of the bowl myself, I really should have stopped, but as I hate wasting  <START:Food> food <END>  and the other 2 had had enough, I just kept shovelling it in....literally.....using the  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  to shovel up the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> .   <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  mistake.  When I finally finished all the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> , apart from some jalapeños which are a little on the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  side for my  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END>  palate,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a only a handful of  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  left.  About 15 minutes later, when I got up to use the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> , I realised just how full I was - serious  <START:F_FoodItem> muffin <END>  top and struggled to do my pants back up.  Walking home was not at all comfortable, more of a waddle.  Then I seriously needed to lie down and stretch out.  I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  hesitate to say that these are the best  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  I've ever had.  I just wish we had a 4th person to help us eat the monstrosity.As for the pub; it is quite small, but with character.  Laid back  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , heavy  <START:A_Ent_Music> rock <END>  playing in the  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END> , not your usual pub  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> .  Would definitely go back for the  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  alone, but I might give it a while!

Great selection.  Lamb vindaloo is excellent.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. I used to visit the Paradise  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  until it closed due to salmonella. I figured this Westside  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  would be fine. My coworker and I went last night for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was absolutely terrible considering  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were about a quarter full, but we dealt with it.Soon after we got home we were both experiencing terrible abdominal pains, followed by throwing up every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  we ate. This went on for a few hours. Double  <START:Food> food <END>  poisoning? Disgusting. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need to revamp their entire business. Kitchen,  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END> . Firefly is headed down a bad road.

This is my favorite  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in vegas. I used to frequent the rio and m  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  for years, but ever since i tried this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , i'm never going back. Some of the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> served <END>  individually in small pots or  <START:Food> dishes <END>  which is nice since i have no  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  control. ALL of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  i tried that had starchy  <START:F_FoodItem> carbs <END>  were good. (i.e. the leek  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> !!!! this was ridiculous and the risotto) ONLY gripe was that the prime rib was over- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  by my standards. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was murder.... I think i ate like 40 chocolate covered  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END> . I swear  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sprinkled a little bit of crack into each one.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had oreo-covered marshmallows,  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Dessert> shortcake <END> , and a bunch of little things of which i had no idea their names or what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  consisted of. But most of it was pretty darn good. I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to go back in a couple weeks and GO TO TOWN on their  <START:Food> buffet <END> .

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was recommended by a friend when I moved to Las Vegas.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> consistent <END> , and everyone I have brought  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  LOVES it!

 <START:F_Drinks> yummy <END>  locally  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . loved the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> iced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  growler over the summer. just the basics, but  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .

very  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> -went in just minutes before closing  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ... was just getting a "quick" sub &  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  to go.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was 1 other customer in shop. i parked in handicap  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  spot right in front. made my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  filled my  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . had a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  to wait for my sub (*because of my handicap) "shift mgr. graham" had stepped out to give that other customer something that was accidentally left out of his  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  as graham came back in he says "just so you know,  we're closed" then gave me an awkward look... then walked away... & i know he knew that i was dumbfounded by his comment because he kept awkwardly looking over at me - i hadn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even received my  <START:Food> food <END> - how did he know if i was or wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  planning to eat in shop or leave.  or was that just his way of saying get out...???  well when i did receive my  <START:Food> food <END>  i had asked for his name so i could call back the next day to speak to  <START:S_Staff> management <END> .  graham had the  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  that who gave me his name, & he wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  aware that is good friend text my son to "apologize if he sounded disrespectful" not even 5 minutes after i left the shop... seems to me that graham was rethinking the way he was speaking to customers... ya think???

Fabulous  <START:Food> food <END> !!!!!  Great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> !!!  Fabulous customer  <START:Service> service <END> !!!!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was great will go again!!!  Have already told at least 10 other people to go try it out!!!  Fun little spot!!!!  Make sure to make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get very busy!!!  The people working  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  where so helpful & kind & all had a beautiful smile!!!  Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to go again!!!

Superb  <START:Service> service <END> , excellent Deer  <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and rich  <START:F_FoodItem> lamb shank <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly. Very satisfied  <START:Food> diner <END> .

I was going to be generous and give three stars but then I tried the peach cobbler. When I walked up to the podium to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  I asked if I could sample their BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The man said he would bring out the house BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and some type of sweet BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I did not like either  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and this should have been an inclination of what was to come. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the two  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  plate with pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and for my side I chose the baked  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  <START:S_Del_Time> 10 minutes <END>  later my  <START:Food> food <END>  was ready. First, I tried the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and both were less then impressive. I used some BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that I had at home to spruce up the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Next, I tried the baked  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were good, I liked the chunks of  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  and I think their house BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better when it is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  into something. Lastly, the peach cobbler was inedible. I took one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  and that was it, all I could  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was nutmeg. Still in search of good BBQ in Las Vegas and that includes the sides as well.

Super  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  Tuesdays and Thursdays. I had always preferred traditional  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  (Tuesday) over boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  (Thursday). Personally the boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  somehow do not feel like I'm having  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Despite being easier to eat, I would like my  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to be messy, but that is just me =)I have tried a  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  variety from the non  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  Sweet BBQ  to the extremely  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  Wild. Some favorites are Parmesan and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> , Honey BBQ, Asian Zing and Mango Habanero.The  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  Tuesdays is the only reason for showing up. It's a great way to get  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .

I've been wanting to try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but since the other ramen  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had overly  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END>  broth the last two times, I got turned off eating ramen all together.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a odd day of constant rain and cool temps in this blister which needed to be celebrated with some  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . Made for a perfect excuse to have something warming.I grabbed up a  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  ramen and the BF went for  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  ramen and on the recommendation of the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  for a "lighter" broth got shoyu base. The  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> savory <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END>  (has some oil floaties, but enough to be a deterrent) and not overtly  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END> . I really like that it comes with a soft  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiled <END>  soy  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> , the thicker rustic  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roast <END>  style cut of chashu was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and the ramen was rightfully chewy. This is a bit different from the traditional Sapporo  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  I'm used to as it normally has corn,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts,  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> . I suppose I could add those  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I took a  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the BFs shoyu  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  broth and it was fairly good. Still a bit porky, but much lighter since it isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  creamy like the  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  crept up to a  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burn <END> . We got a mini chashu bowl to share. It was much smokier than the chashu in the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  so it seems  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  throw it on the grill before serving and top with a drizzle of sweet soy so it's a different  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I like this preparation. I wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer some  <START:F_Ingredients> vinegar <END>  as a side condiment as the little bit of acid would be nice with the sweet. We came within the last hour of being open so I figured that's why  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick, but hope that it  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  comes out that fast regularly. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  make us feel rushed. I definitely prefer this over the other ramen  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Somehow my BF got it in his head he doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like ramen so even though I like it, it may be a trek I make again alone.

I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best  <START:Food> food <END>  overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> ). If this is your first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  trying Postino, you MUST try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> . It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are trying to copy Postino's  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , but it is never as good. Aside from the  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. Most importantly, the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> really nice <END>  also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have their special - any bottle of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  AND a tray of  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> ! It cannot be beat!!

Hands down, the best sisig we've  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  in the US.  <START:Service> service <END>  sucked though. Took a really long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for us to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  (although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a few empty  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ),  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  took an even longer  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to come back to get our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and we were already halfway done with our  <START:Food> meal <END>  when the sisig came out. The  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  beside us who came in later than us got their sisig way ahead of us so maybe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . Good thing the sisig was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the wait! Will definitely go back for that.

I'll keep it simple. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  sits right under Five Guys and In-N-Out on my list of favorite fast ( <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> )  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  joints... It's a great  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> ... but you don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have as many options and the  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even compare to Five Guys. I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  and swiss char... that's basically the extent of their  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  options... and I thoroughly enjoyed it! But the whole  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was thinking I wish this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  had  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  jalapenos on it!!Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but given the choice I'm going across the street...

Normally I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  give 2 star's but I am going to give this over hyped  <START:Food> buffet <END>  one for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  being that I'm a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  lover and have  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in tons of them to compare to.First off this is as I seen one if not the most  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> 's in town right now with myself  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  $48 to get in even with a player's card.2nd off I have no clue how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  got 500  <START:Food> dishes <END>  out of the mixture  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no way by far 500  <START:Food> dishes <END>  in this  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is the same amount of selection from stateion to station as any other typical  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Vegas maybe  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  trying to hype up the fact you can CUSTOMIZE a  <START:Food> dish <END>  up to 500 ways but either way I'm not buying it because I was expecting to see once again THE KING OF  <START:Food> buffet <END> 'S  <START:Restaurant> here <END> !Let's say the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  was very poor, the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  in some  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  in a bag, the Italian  <START:Food> food <END>  was very bland nothing interesting or unique especially the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  balls  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END>  freezer selection.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even serve  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  so I had to settle on  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  chops also that were very  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  in  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .. just the list goes on and on of just miss after miss of trying to hit the spot on  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and selection.The only positive thing I can say about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is that my greeter was very nice and gave me a quick tour of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was a very nice gentleman which I tipped him accordingly but other then that I'll never return.

Hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is very good.

 <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  my husband and I love it.  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is really  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great.

Absolutely love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!! So pleased that it arrived in the Surprise area! This  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  has great  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  and if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ever do make a mistake (which has happened only once in the 100+ times I've been  <START:Restaurant> there <END> )  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are very quick to make sure that you are  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and properly taken care of! Love me some Freddy's!

Had early Friday night pre-theater  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Once we got a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> 's attention the  <START:Service> service <END>  was very good.  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  with good suggestions but not intrusive. Casual open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>   <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , causal but lively ambience, perfect for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with friends. My wife & her friend enjoyed a "prickly pear  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END> " not too sweet very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> !  Excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  overall  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . Guac was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  & paired well with the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . We had 3  <START:Food> dishes <END>  perfect for sharing. Mexican street corn nicely  <START:F_Ingredients> spiced <END>  a bit messy but  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. Nice  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  updated take on classic fare. Will certainly go back!

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in town and Chu is hella cutie . Ron is great and all the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END>  are  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  . I try to come all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> 

We were excited to have a  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  joint in the area - but unfortunately we will not be  <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is extremely  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  - opening the door as we walked in and a  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  taking our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  immediately - but the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  cannot make up for the sub par  <START:Food> food <END> .  We had  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  that was over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  - followed by my husbands  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  that to me looked canned - and he said did not  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  much better - not to mention the double corn tortillas could not even stay together.  Move on to my  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>  mahi  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  that somehow was extreme greasy. I also had a side of plantains that were more like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burnt <END>  sautéed bananas than plantains - though my husbands  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were good.  So we may be back for a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  - but not  <START:Food> food <END> .Oh and one last note - the  <START:A_Decor> decorations <END>  are very beachish - but the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was not - it should have been old beach  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  - Beach Boys, Steel Drums, Bob Marley etc...

This is a review from a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  lover. Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a bday party and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  does not serve  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  /  <START:F_Drinks> liquor <END> , only a few  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> . Just writing this as an FYI to anyone expecting a variety of  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  choices. Not a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  person....? Go somewhere else.

Oh man, first of all I am soooo happy  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is finally a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like this in the east valley. Second, it's amazing! The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is super cute and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and helpful, and the  <START:Food> food <END> ... Holy  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> , yum! So far, the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  duo and the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  are both incredible. I'll definitely be back to try more since pretty much everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  sounds  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . Oh and if you like peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  & jelly  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have an  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cupcake <END> !

 <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  is where it's at! love these  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> . I've tried them all

3.5 stars for  <START:Food> food <END> . I really enjoyed the shawarma. It was very flavorful.  The dolmades was good too. It has the right acidity on it. The  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END> , however, was dry and lacking  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  feta  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  lacks  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like an old refried  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . If it's not then it was way over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> .  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 3 stars <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> : we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $26.10 for 2 combo  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  wrap with one side each. FYI their combo doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  come with  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . You would assume for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  it does.

I'm so rarely on the early end of a  <START:A_Decor> trendy <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that I feel pretty cool having visited The Summit Room just a month after  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  opened! It looks totally different than when it was Bruegger's - I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  speak to the Mayobird side, but I definitely felt like I was in a casual,  <START:A_Decor> trendy <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . A girlfriend and I went after work and got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  right at 5:00 when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  opened. We were only the second people in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , and we grabbed a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  itself is awfully pretty... glass bottles as far as the eye can see and silver  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Furniture> stools <END>  lend themselves to a very clean, modern feel without being sterile.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were maybe 12-14  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , a few  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  along the side, and a high, long  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at the front near the front door.  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's also a  <START:Ambience> huge <END> , inviting  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> , but it was a little sweltering the night we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I also love the  <START:Ambience> huge <END> , private  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot, which is a little rare on East Blvd.Our  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> , Scott, was so fun and gave us honest recommendations on what to get. I think he got a little overwhelmed later in the evening, but I'm guessing  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're just getting their footing. We opted to split the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flat  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flat  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  came in four pieces, which were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  if just a smidgen dry, and the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , too. It came over a corn  <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> , which  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  verrrry corny, so buyer beware. We were also given complimentary cheddar scones before  <START:Food> dinner <END> , which  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Red  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  cheddar bay biscuits, only in  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  scone form... mmmmm.We each got a signature  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> ;  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are 7, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're named after the tallest summit on each continent. The Mount Vinson was very smooth - cinnamon, ginger  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , vanilla - and The Kilimanjaro was refreshing and sweet for summer -  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END> , cranberry, gin.When we left, we noticed that the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  was packed! This is a great " <START:A_Environment> classy <END> " addition to a casual row of  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  on East Blvd. Do yourself a favor, and check out The Summit Room.

Nice new chain all u can eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Tokyo, <START:Service> service <END>  are fast and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , <START:Food> food <END>  are almost  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> ,especially the raw  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  which was sweet and  <START:F_Drinks> yummy <END> !One downside is the mussel  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we had last night were not so  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> .The  <START:A_Decor> decoration <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is cool, I like the fancy chandelier ,maybe that's the reason it's a little  <START:W_Price> pricey <END>  for a AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .One more thing,do avoid general Tao kinda of  <START:Food> dish <END>  ,that was just ridiculous

The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I have ever asked my  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to get me the  <START:S_Menu> recipe <END>  for a  <START:Food> dish <END> ! The Carolina coastal catch is hands down one of the best  <START:Food> dishes <END>  I've ever had. Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to celebrate our anniversary!
The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  helped me was very nice. However for $7 I expect  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  out of my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which wasn't  <START:Opinion> bad <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't great. Honestly I could get a better, less expensive  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  at  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  station two or Harris teeter.
I love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  Huge  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  All very tempting, but from the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we visited we tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict and have been hooked ever since!!The Hollandaise  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is the best I've had ever - anywhere!  And the  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  come with  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  are to die for!!  I don't know how  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are thin, crisp, potatoey and very onioney.  I love  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> !!   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only makes me sad  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I live in Durham and only get to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  about once a year.I did switch once and try the Dutch Baby, which was big and lovely and tasty with all the powdered  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> lemony <END> , but I really missed my  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  bennie and  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and have never looked back.  Oh, you must try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and btw, get the  <START:F_FoodItem>   sour     cream   <END>  and applesauce for the tater  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> .
Ever just want excellent Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  for your party, just like Mama used to make but without the  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  of preparation and cooking?  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  from Comedor's catering  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> :  green  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> flautas <END>  (substitution of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  for our Halloween party.  Surprisingly, Comedor also included a quart  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem>   sour     cream   <END>  and two big bags of tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> .   <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  were extremely reasonable and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing!  I'm not a big green  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  fan but I am now!  Chunks of fresh green  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  and boy, were the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  plump full of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> !  I've decided  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I'll never slave over a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  stove to prep for a party or get together.  El Comedor's catering  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  saved me tons of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and headache AND  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was extremely affordable.  I got to enjoy our party and everyone couldn't say enough great  <START:Food> things <END>  about the  <START:Food> food <END> !
The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are good and the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  are friendly.  I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are open until 7pm, while most of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> shops <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  much earlier.  The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are kind of steep for what the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are so I marked a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  down. I had the d.a.m.  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and the  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> .  are good.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  fresh!  My husband had the bangers  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Price> 9 bucks <END> .  I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have the  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  in individual baggies so the  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END>  crowd can just grab and go. Also,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  sell  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:Service> treats <END> .  So  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's good.
I work in central Phoenix and have heard good  <START:Food> things <END>  about the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Finally got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with a friend and we both found the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to have many  <START:Food> items <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we would love to try. I decided to have the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  open faced and seared which is perfect.  Was seasoned deliciously and accompanied by a fresh side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  We had a friendly  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Meggie who was polite enough to write down the name of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  we  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .  I will be back...soon.
I give Cooperstown a five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  - based on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  alone.  I ate  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with 2 kids and our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  was $30 with tip.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is nothing fancy - just  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and refreshing on a hot day.  The girls said  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  fingers and mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was good and I really enjoyed the Ty Cobb  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  Also, love the giant glasses of iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was attentive and quick for being so busy.  Neat  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go overall.
Great  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  at a very reasonable  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> !
I used to be scared...I used to be petrified.  I was never one to branch out with my  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , which meant  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I never had Indian  <START:Food> food <END>  before...until a couple of months ago when I was invited to a  <START:Food> dinner <END>  party. And at  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> .  of India...my Indian  <START:Food> food <END>  cherry was broken.I decided to review  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now...since I have experienced other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  since.  I tend to always come back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END> .  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  seems very clean, I love the Bollywood videos  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  play, and I love the  <START:Service> service <END> .  And I think  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have the best  <START:Food> buffet <END> !  Now, I am really  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  at names of the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  (which is why I end up at the  <START:Food> buffet <END> ...I may not know the names, but I know what I like looks like)See me  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  real soon :)
I have eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several times only because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  right around the corner from my house. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was good the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we ate  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and has been down hill ever since.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like the prepackaged  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  you find at the store and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are so small. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a philly  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and a california  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and all you can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was the  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END> . Totally disappointed.
mmmm New Mexico style mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  in Arizona! We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a number of  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and shared to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  a combo of  <START:Food> things <END> :  The Chile con (green) Carne & The Chile Relleno were my favorite!  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  and Chimichanga were just good. Our favorite was the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Dessert> sopapillas <END>  (w red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) and shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gorditas <END> . You can't find authentic  <START:F_FoodItem> gorditas <END>  anywhere but Texas and NM, so what a  <START:Service> treat <END> ! Si Senor is very generous in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  complimentary  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  w 4 different  <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END>  when you arrive then  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Dessert> sopapillas <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . ( <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  might charge for a 2nd  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  though -not sure, never had to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  -ask your  <START:S_Staff> server <END> ). Only negative I can express would be  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't have the soap filled in the men's  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END>  (per my husband ;)
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  little hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  packs some big  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . We came to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  family-owned  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to celebrate our friends' engagement.   they  are regulars and said we'd love the  <START:Food> food <END> ;  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were right.  We were greeted warmly and informed  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  would take a bit  <START:S_Del_Time> longer <END>  due to a large catering  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  was also cooking.  No matter since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't seem like much of a delay at all.  We enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ,  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and conversation before our  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> courses <END>   <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> marsala <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a generous helping of three pieces of moist  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with a very tasty  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and lots of  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ; I highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> !  Believe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  or not, I didn't have any  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , but my friend's  <START:F_FoodItem> spaghetti <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  looked  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  I love little hole-in-the- <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  places like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  over a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  any day. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is good.PS-our friends are having Buon Gusto cater  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  wedding reception, which means I get  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> marsala <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END> --grazie!
Thank god for newer reviews... I should have listened to  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> !!!Been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few times before back in like 2003-2004  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  frame. Remember the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to be much better back then. Was in town visiting and wanted to return to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  again. Yes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the same old  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty crappy.  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  HORRIBLE and these  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  working  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  lack major personality.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was constant confusion as to if we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  or not, what we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , and so forth. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was actually a bit rude I thought constantly rushing us and reaching across me constantly to take  <START:S_Cutlery> silverware <END>  and  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  from other side of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , and at 2  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  intervals???Will not return. Seriously if you are pissed to do  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  type of work then get a new job. If you run a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  you better be a little personable.
I haven't lived in Pittsburgh for 4 years, and even now after all  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , on a Thursday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  I wish I was still lived in Oakland so a few friends and I could hit up Fuel for some  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . Fuel is the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Oakland at  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> , particularly if your over 21.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a little  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  but the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  (100 different  <START:S_Menu> varieties <END> ) is the best virtually anywhere. The  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  starts at 11, so you can go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  get  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  with some friends and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a good  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is always excellent, and after 11 a good value. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is always good. I love the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but I could see how  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  could find  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  irritating.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's loud (particularly when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END> . However in my four years going to fuel  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  never once dissuaded me, because the  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is just too good and trying the new  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  is just too much fun.
Ahhhh the Melting Pot. Where do I begin... <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is a little slice of heaven. The Melting Pot is great for a girls get together and  <START:Food> anything <END>  in between. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:Food> fondues <END>  are my favorite.
I'm always on the lookout for your basic  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and 2/3  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  so when I saw La'Wan's in a strip shopping center on South Tryon, I thought I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a try. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was immediate and attentive.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  and a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  from which to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . I chose the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  because I wanted some  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetables <END> . Although the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fine, the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is very limited in  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> :  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> , fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and a couple of other  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would have been OK except  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  charged over $9.00 for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . If I go back, I should probably choose from the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
My girlfriend's family was visiting from Milwaukee.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  wanted to go out for a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  would be suitable for Grandpa and a celiac diet.  We decided on the Stable Grill.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the perfect choice.Before  <START:Food> dinner <END>  we all had a few of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  famous old fashioneds.  Korbel is  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  rail  <START:F_Drinks> brandy <END>  so you know  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are going to be good.   <START:S_Staff> her <END>  dad loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had a  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  raved about.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  which were solid.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came with these  <START:F_Ingredients> buttered <END>  red  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were simple but  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  My GF had the  <START:F_FoodItem> perch <END>  which  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  thought were some of the best  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 's had.The Stable's  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is quite remarkable.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is basically an old stable fitted with a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> dining   room   <END> .  Old wood  <START:A_Places> floor <END> , rock  <START:A_Decor> walls <END> , a huge barn  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END>  and rickety stairs leading to a second  <START:A_Places> floor <END> . A lot of trendy places aim for the kind of  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  the stable offers but you cant duplicate authenticity.All in all  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a supper club style dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in a cool old  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  setting.  If you are looking to try something off the beaten path and are tired of  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , trendy  <START:Food> aiolis <END> , beet  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  or whatever the latest foodie  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> is  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  week, the Stable Grill at Quiveys Grove is just right.
Sows of all ethnicities are  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  at China One!China One is a  <START:F_FI_Size> massive <END>  Mongolian-Chinese  <START:Food> buffet <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is never too full, in a great  <START:Restaurant> location <END> , features reasonable  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  and most of the offerings tempt repeatedly.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a couple of issues, though. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is pedestrian and too carefree; the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are space cadets and rarely present timely.  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  plenty of fluids ... then  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  ... the  <START:Food> food <END>  is liberally laced of  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  MSG. As expected, the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is old and a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> health <END>  risk with  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  swallow greatly increases.The review reads a little negative, but China One is a sensational guilty pleasure for its  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> . If you see me at the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , though ... step aside and give respects.
I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  about 5 times total, and I am completely unimpressed. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is overpriced and just not  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I have no problem  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for a good  <START:Food> meal <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  wasn't a good  <START:Food> meal <END> . I could have made what ended up on my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  from the contents of my refrigerator and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  better. The one caveat to my "My Florist has crappy  <START:Food> food <END> " attitude is the  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>  scones. These are absolute heaven. Too  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  I won't be back for  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> , as getting one means dealing with the rude  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Out of the five visits, only once was the  <START:Service> service <END>  decent, and I think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was only because my dining companion knew the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's  <START:Opinion> bad <END> . I never went in dressed like a bum or  <START:Service> treated <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  obnoxiously, but yet the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  had no problem  <START:Service> treating <END>  me like a second class citizen who didn't belong in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . I don't know what kind of qualifications you have to have to get decent  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but I obviously don't have  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> . I won't be back ever.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a shame, too, because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is within walking distance.
Va Dang is pretty darn  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I prefer Pho Thanh, but thats my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . I like the  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END>  better at Pho Thanh, however Va Dang has way better  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  available.
Funky strip mall like  <START:Restaurant> location <END>  but great  <START:Food> food <END> . Got some free  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , I was stoked. Great  <START:F_Appetizer> tapas <END>  to share, good for light eaters or to hold over a drunken hunger with out making you sick. Just say no to a  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  will not be pretty, stick with FireFly for great  <START:F_Appetizer> tapas <END> !
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in the valley!  Not only is  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  in my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> ; which makes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  great,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  around. Never too long of a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  and always  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . Competitive  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  and large  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Its nice to go back and get the same  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
We've been dying to visit  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for years! Why did we  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for so long??? On countless occasions, we've heard nightmare stories of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  for three  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  or  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .   <START:S_Staff> people <END>  seem to rave about the authentic and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>  style  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We had to have a two  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  break on a weekday.  We took a gamble to see if we would be able to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  within a reasonable amount of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and finally check  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  off our list. To our surprise we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  within 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and had our  <START:Food> food <END>  brought out within 15-20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . We had the ' <START:F_FoodItem> caprese <END> '  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and the biancoverde  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>  added and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was INCREDIBLE!!! The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was fresh and tasty and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  reminded us of great  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in Italy! BEST  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in the Phoenix metropolitan area! Note  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , but probably would not  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  3+  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a wonderful  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> --if you have a  <START:S_Del_Time> longer <END>  break!Note: The website states, " <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  accepted for parties of 6-10 when possible."
I don't go in enough for the morning  <START:S_Staff> barista <END>  to know my name, but  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  always phrases  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  as, "I'm sorry, I should know  <START:Restaurant> this <END> , what is your name again?" and I find  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> charming <END> .  The homemade whipped  <START:Food> cream <END>  is almost impossible to resist - and if you're going to do  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  then you might as well have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  be resting upon a large Velvet Mocha - one of the best  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  in Phoenix.  I feel like I should bring my Powerbook  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  - and I even find myself counting how many non-mac users dare to crack open  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  cases.  Still,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a fun little  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  with friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and fabulous hot  <START:F_Drinks> beverages <END> . Bring an out of town SF or NY hipster who refuses to believe  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is ANY culture in Phoenix.
Since we didn't hit Craftsteak on our last trip to Vegas, I made a point to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . No  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my husband and I have lost 120lbs together and are just eating differently. So, we were a tad  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  conservative, but still splurged and left with our bellies full. We split the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bisque <END>  to start, which was good, but cannot compare to Kokomo's (which is now  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  to make  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for Tom's Heritage  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  BOO). I didn't like the large pieces of  <START:Food> tarragon <END>  on top, which feels like chewing on pieces of grass, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was tolerable. The  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  was nice and tender.For  <START:Food> dinner <END>  we split the  <START:F_FoodItem> 10oz   filet   <END> , the  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> puree <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was still so much  <START:Food> food <END> ! The  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  was made with  <START:F_Ingredients> butternut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>  and was so rich and creamy and really wonderful. I know  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is what properly made  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like and how easy  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  can be to get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wrong.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> puree <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END>  were absolute heaven.For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> pumpkin <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  and I was pretty disappointed.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a small circle of mushy  <START:F_Ingredients> pumpkin <END>  with a vanilla  <START:Food> cream <END>  of some kind on top of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I hate to say  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , but  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory  <START:F_Dessert> cheescake <END>  was better than  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  stuff. Major bummer, thus the deletion of a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> . When you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  $15 for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  at a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END> , you want to shove your face  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  in and eat 15 of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> , not just pick at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and wish  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  like at a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  where you hate  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
Mediocre at best.. went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was in NY/NY and we were staying  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Hungry and in the mood for  <START:Food> italian <END>  we went in...  <START:Service> service <END>  was good, the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was awesome.. <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  dry, and without much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ...  The  <START:F_FoodItem> swordfish <END>  was pretty good but again not much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .. keep in mind we had just  <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  in Vegas and were hungry and tired and excited and didn't have any  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in our system... to me  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I would eat and enjoy just about  <START:Food> anything <END> !!...  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was still mediocre at best..  Wouldn't recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and definitely not going to eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again.
Nice  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  good  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  even have a little  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  i also like  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  too all around a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat!
Always  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and great  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ! We enjoyed another wonderful  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  just last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was sooo  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to getting 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . However, one thing changed my mind. I had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  in the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END> , and I was on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and on my  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  notes, I proposed a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't ready when I got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  so we had to take a timer and stand around.30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later we got the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was facing  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  which was a good  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the only reason  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't get 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . The  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  took way to long to get and even when I put  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  for in advance.The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was nice and quick, and explained the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  just right. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing! I love  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and decided to go with  <START:F_FoodItem> lasagna <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was hot and fresh  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't a loud  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and was very clean. I wil love to come back to try something else on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
 <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's taken me forever to get to Chelsea's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been wanting to try for years! I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  past weekend and was so happy to finally head to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  beautiful  <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  has a breezy island vibe with sprawling  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patios <END>  both at the front of the house and back. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's no wonder the spot was bustling when I went for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at 9 p.m. on a Friday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  -- the mixed crowd of all ages packed the house, which had cozy  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  and striking printed  <START:A_Decor> curtains <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  make guests feel right at home, no matter the crowd. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  contained a few  <START:A_Ent_Tv> televisions <END>  with  <START:A_Entertainment> sporting <END>  events on, so you could  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  in any type of  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  you wanted -- cozy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> dining   room   <END> , spacious  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  or at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .Our  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were professional and attentive, and the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was fantastic and hugely portioned -- I took  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>  of mine home. I loved the Lucy's "Spiked"  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  ($8)  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  I got, with  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  and fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was refreshing and strong and didn't have a gross  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  --  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was easy to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and tasty.We started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  ($10), which is pretty much a must-try since all the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , including the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , are all made in-house. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  had the perfect amount of spiciness (maybe a 7 out of 10), and the  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  would have been great to eat on its own.For my  <START:Food> meal <END> , I tried the Shangri-La Vegetarian  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ($12), which consisted of  <START:F_Ingredients> grains <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> nuts <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> seeds <END> . I usually don't get French  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , but I did  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had really great seasoning and the perfect amount of  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was tasty, but the consistency made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  difficult to hold together. Not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  matters --  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a great  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was really filling.Chelsea's biggest impression on me was the  <START:Service> service <END>  of the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , who made you feel  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  and valued from start to finish.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's no wonder  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  remain so loyal to the  <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  --  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems like a wonderful  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for anyone to have a great  <START:Food> meal <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review is just specific to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . I took my mom to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  after a busy morning of shopping at the mall. We were greeted right away and asked which we would prefer, a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  or a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . I love when  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  give you a choice if either are available. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> , friendly and knowledgeable about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Mom and I both had  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Cob was so yummy! I almost ate  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  all and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a good  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> ! The only downside to the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  charged me 3.25 for an unsweetened  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . What??! I should have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  house  <START:F_Ingredients> chardonnay <END>  for a few bucks  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END> .. Oh well.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  else was wonderful and I'll certainly return for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  again soon.
So I have been a customer at Ticoz from literally day one.  I have been through the change in ownership and I have to say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the current  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , Joe, is so terrific!   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  comes over and chats with us and is always so awesome and down to earth!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is even better lately (if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's possible) and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  always go the extra mile to make your dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  terrific.    I'm not someone who has been to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and is reviewing  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ......I am not a  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  spokesperson!  Just a very satisfied customer.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a hidden gem in Las Vegas. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is right in the middle of the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  at Palace Station. I was expecting an actual  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , not a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with 20  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to sit down so I figured  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was definitely  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . Luckily, I was with other  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  so I played Roulette while we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> . Once  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  take your  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  very calmly.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do not rush you considering  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  to eat. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in steam pots instead of a gas burner.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> oyster bloody mary shooters <END>  and the Pan roast at level 7 hot..  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is soo good I would recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to anyone...
Margherita Doc  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , some of the best I've had, and we had GREAT  <START:Service> service <END> !!! Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  Natalia was fantastic and very informative...great first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  :)
You get a lot of  <START:Food> food <END> . But  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is poor and  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are high.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is overrated and  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  too high!!!
My favorite Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in town. I think Taqueria Guadalajara has better  <START:Food> food <END>  in general, but I prefer El Pastor. The  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  are just as good and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is easier to get to and always easy to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> ; and the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  are fantastic! The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very welcoming, making  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  easy to come back regularly.If you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  one of the  <START:Food> meals <END> , get an extra  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  a la carte.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are too good to come in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and not have at least one.
Very Disappointing is an understatement! Good China boasts on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  website  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were the 2007 recipients of New York's Top 100 Chinese/Asian Fusion Award, and all I can say is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  may have been so in 2007. However, Good China fails to live up to  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  reputation, today, 7-years later. My family has recently moved back to the United States from living in Singapore for the last 4-years, and we are originally from New York. So, we have a little knowledge in authentic Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  and Americanized New York Chinese  <START:Food> food <END> --and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  eating  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  really fell short.Starting with the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , we had "Spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> ", and for those of you New Yorkers, most  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  have flavorful " <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  are stuffed with a combination of  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, and Asian  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> . What we received were  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  saturated "Spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> ". Because  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were so oily, each  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  oozed  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> , canceling out any  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> . from the  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetables <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> spices <END>  used. We could have literally squeezed out enough  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  to reuse. We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the " <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  Puffs", which many Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , including many in Singapore call " <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  Rangoon"--a type of dim sum.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was very little filling used inside the wrappers, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seemed  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  someone might have been heavy handed with  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> , because  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were incredibly  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  instead of savory. You could not even  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  any  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  (and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  may have used imitation  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  from the looks of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ), nor could you  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  the  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had been turned into a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:Food> cream <END>  due to the over use of something  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  as a flavoring.What can I say about the "War Wonton  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> "? The proper name for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is "Wor Wonton  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ", but what we had was "Slime  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ". The wontons had been so over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  melted off the filling, producing an off-putting slimy  <START:Food> texture <END> . However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END>  was okay--a bit on the salty side.Next, the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  we tried. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  "House Lo Mein". Obviously,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use Fettuccini  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  instead of authentic Chinese  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  too was on the salty side and the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> --not at all tender. We also had " <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Young" ( <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Yong), which were flat and  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> -like in  <START:Food> texture <END> --nothing like  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Young.  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Young is, simply put, an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> . Well,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is in Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in New York and Singapore. How can you mess up an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> ? Oh, you can make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  the consistency of  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ! The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use on top of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems to be the same brown salty  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  used on other  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we had like the " <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ". " <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ", in  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  we have ever eaten  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , is usually a light garlicky  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> --not a brown salty  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with no hint of  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .The "Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ", we are still not sure if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was actually  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  inside the heavily  <START:F_Ingredients> battered <END>  nuggets--the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was hard and over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  also  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like someone had poured a whole bottle of honey over the nuggets--no sesame  <START:F_Ingredients> seeds <END>  in sight. In addition, if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  could not get worse, when you looked in the container of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  supposed "Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ",  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  spooned in all the burnt residual  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sits within the  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  used for frying--meaning  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are not periodically cleaning and changing the  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  between  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> --gross!On the plus side, the "House Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> " was descent,  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was good, and the  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  looked clean. Overall, even though the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are average, you are overpaying for poor  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
A few years ago, I would have given  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END>  a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  review but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has gone downhill since then.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  used to give  <START:Offers> discounts <END>  if you only got a few  <START:Food> things <END>  in your  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have continually raised  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  while giving  <START:A_Env_Size> smaller <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END> . I'm pretty sure  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use  <START:A_Env_Size> smaller <END>  spoons. And I get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are a corporation and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the decisions aren't always up to  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no denying the value has gone down hill.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still good  <START:Food> food <END> , but not  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> 9  dollars <END>  a person.
Very nice! Cugino's is one of the few true  <START:Food> italian <END>  delis in town, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a good assortment of what  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  from back East are used finding.Yes,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are plenty of popular favorites  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we all know:  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> subs <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> parmigiana <END> , etc., and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are also some  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> foods <END>  you might not be familiar with.I have an "old world"  <START:Food> italian <END>  heritage thanks to my mom.  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  St. Joseph's day,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made  <START:F_FoodItem> arancini <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  Easter  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzagiana <END> . When I first found Cugino's I was floored!  <START:F_FoodItem> arancini <END>  readily available! Mortadella in the deli case! Checkerboard  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  by the dozen! Frozen  <START:F_FoodItem> sfogliatelli <END>  to take home and bake!If you've been looking for  <START:Food> food <END>  like Nonna used to make, or you're feeling a little adventurous, or you just want some good  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  by the slice, head to the University district and give Cugino's a try.
CHECK YOUR  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  BEFORE LEAVING!!! I'm not one to complain or even care much when my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  is messed up; as I work in the  <START:Food> food <END>  industry, and understand  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  shot happens.. But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's happened  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  than 3 times now, at around 12 am- (not a busy  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ) Just make sure you get what your  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not fun to get home and not have someone's  <START:Food> meal <END> .
A  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  has to earn my respect. First pass is a quick look-through of the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  in the display. I try to be unobtrusive about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so I don't look like a tourist, but if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's stacked up and already cut, or if I see a big vat-o'-spicy- <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> -with-mayo, or a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwave <END>  on the back counter, I'll just flee, or I'll  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  California  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .Second pass is to throw down the gauntlet to the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END> . A triple-whammy  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  and yellowtail  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END> . Typically  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  will  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  between $30 and $40, so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had better be the goddam best the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  has to offer. Kojisan did not dissapoint. Either later in my first visit or on my second when we had dropped the pretense,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  stuck out his chest and beat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with a quick head nod to say  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  took pride in vanquishing my challenge with ease.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was at least as good as the finest  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  I've ever had in the valley (cut and  <START:Service> served <END>  by  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  on Shea's KING of the Valley, "Fred"-san).Now, I have spent the last 10 years at Ayako, and over those years, I developed a scale of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is " <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  eating". At the lowest level  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is "good", then "very good", then "excellent". And at the very top is "life changing". Ayako was always very good, usually excellent, and sometimes if you're lucky, life changing. Hana is always excellent and very often is life changing.Now I realize  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  seems to be a lot of hoopla about a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , right? I mean, come on. But if you're a serious sushicon (connoisseur), you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know some supersnob sushicons won't look at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  unless if's alive just before you eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Yeah,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's pretty much a life-changing  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , but hey,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is PHOENIX, for god's sake.The third pass is the whole, deep-fried  <START:F_FoodItem> ama-ebi <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ).  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a test of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END> , knowledge of just the right  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , how to prepare  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  (which pieces of the shell to remove), and of the simplicity in preparation. The resulting presentation can seem scary to the unwashed. Two big eyes are staring up at you, tentacles sticking  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  which way, now crispy and yummy, and my final squeeze of  <START:F_Ingredients> lemon <END>  completes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The "brains" are the best part.The fourth pass is if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  know how to make a proper  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END>  (cold  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> , crepe-like thing).  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's fluffy like  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has seemingly thousands of layers upon layers, folded over and over like the finest katana. Once again, Kojisan presented some of the finest  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END>  I have ever  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .The fifth and final pass is the hardest to fulfill. Natto is fermented soybean, which when potent smells like the nastiest stinky socks you've ever experienced. Most American  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  bars won't  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just too offensive to nearby  <START:Food> diners <END> . Those  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  do  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  a toned-down mild version  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is like a strong  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Natto is best  <START:Service> served <END>  stirred with soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and topped with the  <START:F_FoodItem> yolks <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> quail <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , sprinkled with finely cut dried  <START:F_Ingredients> seaweed <END> . As you are ready to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , dump  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  over a piping hot bowl of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and devour. Wanna guess if Hana serves  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ?The  <START:Service> service <END>  at Hana is edgy.  <START:Service> service <END>  uniform is hip, and like most  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  bars, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  freely yell at one another across the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> dining   room   <END> . Although Kojisan keeps the A/C on in winter to flush out loiterers, and even though multiple busers swoop down after your last  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to clear your empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> , you'll have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  45 to 70  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  at prime- <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on prime  <START:S_OpenHours> nights <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  can be awkward in the small corner of the front part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  without glaring at other  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  customers, willing  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  to get the heck out of your  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  so you can sit down. Arrive before 6:40 or after 9:10 if you loathe the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .Please don't try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . And please don't tell other  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's just not enough  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for us all.  LOL. Enjoy.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a favorite of mine in Oakland. Great  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> seaweed <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> !  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of other  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  as well but I usually go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . If you work or go to school in Oakland,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a nice little  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to grab  <START:Food> lunch <END> . But  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is one caveat - if you arrive during the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  rush, you may have trouble finding a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  may be a bit long.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  can be problematic if you need to get back to work in a timely fashion. Otherwise  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a favorite of mine. Ah, my eel  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  has just  <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  and my spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  is on the way.  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to enjoy! I encourage you to do the same.
Requested the Mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  vegetarian and got a  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> .  Then not checked on for 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and then had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for a new  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  F  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  If given the choice of any other  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  You should choose another  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  almost an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  for some  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  I could have drove home and made some kraft in a box for how long  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  isht took.
When I first moved to Arizona, I wanted to try new establishments I couldn't find back east. My friend who lives in South Scottsdale brought me  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and I'm  <START:Food> italian <END> , so I was excited. For being named " <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> " its  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  wasn't too great. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> caesar <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> spaghetti <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was OK but nothing to rave about. I wouldn't recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , and I havent been back, but for  <START:Food> italian <END>  and good  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> , I would prob go somewhere else.
The  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  was good and the  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  large. Went with Number 92. Beautiful  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  and interesting Buddhist icons give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a touch of the exotic.   <START:Service> service <END>  a bit slow and  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  never smiled, but acceptable.  Lots of other options in the area - would try something else next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
We stopped by the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at Treasure for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  before going to the Cirque de Soleil  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> . I'd never been to a  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  before so I didn't really know what to expect  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> -wise. I walked around & first got a  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  "American BBQ"  <START:Food> items <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  seemed very  <START:F_FI_Taste> bland <END>  so I decided to try again. Meh, not much better the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  & other small  <START:Food> items <END> .I saw a lot of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  at the  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  so I figured I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a shot.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I was satisfied. I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ravioli <END>  tossed with  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  in an alfredo /  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> -based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I wish I wouldn't found  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  first because I probably would've just gotten two helpings of  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> ! The  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were also pretty good.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a large  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  and I tried out a few different  <START:Food> things <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I enjoyed. One of the highlights was the  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> .Would we stop again? With as much as Las Vegas has to offer, probably not, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a convenient/decent option if you're at the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  anyways.
I have been coming to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END>  for at least 6 years.  The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  has gone down quite a lot  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  past year.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be our family's favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  and have prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> .  We brought some friends over for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  last month and was very disappointed.  Also,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  as we wanted.  When we complained  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  only offered to put  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  back on the grill. No apologies.   <START:Service> service <END>  was mediocre and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the meet is not as good as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be.  I am sad as i had hoped  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> things <END>  would be as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  used to be... A  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  I won't be back.
HORRIBLE! Awful  <START:Service> service <END> , burned  <START:Food> food <END> , dirty  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END> , ants on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , limited  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> , the list could go on and on. The " <START:Food> meal <END>  Deal" includes  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  which is a can of Safeway brand  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> . STAY AWAY! I will never go back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . If you want to overpay for  <START:Food> food <END>  from a what looks like a dirty crack house,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is your  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !
Mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  Squared!   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's all I have to say.Everyone else was trying to be  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  by eating a  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  or  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , but c'mon when in a new  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you have to try the signature  <START:Food> dishes <END> .The Mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  Squared didn't look even  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to what you might get out of a Kraft box.  Instead  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a white gooey  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  (not elbows) with  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , bacon (big pieces), and a  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  (?).  Absolutely  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .But  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , one of the most important  <START:Food> things <END> ....the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> .  You walk in and to your left is an enclosed  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  full of kegs.  You can see in via the glass and  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  the lines running from the kegs up to the ceiling.  Then you see huge chrome pipes running across the ceiling through the foyer into the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and across to the center  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  To add perspective we are taking about a hundred  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> .Dafe
I honestly think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's cheap, convenient and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great (obviously, you wanna to go right when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  open since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's fresh) i think for the theme and  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's totally  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , plus for  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in arizona is not  <START:Opinion> bad <END> ! the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly. I would rather eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  100000000000  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  than RA or Stingray  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> 
We've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  times and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  attention to the  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  levels when we discuss with the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  taker. If you make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  set the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  up and take you in right away. Much better to eat  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  way. Although we have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mild spiciness levels the last few times, I think I am going to give  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  a shot again next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  spiciness level. I think  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  probably  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  best with spiciness at the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  level. I like  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curries <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetables <END>  better than the tandoori  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> .
I have been to BLT  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  multiple times and  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is amazing! the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are great and  <START:Service> served <END>  anyway you want  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  i am a med rare man and the last few times i have been  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has been 100% on! the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and able to  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  you super quick. the quotes on the backs of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  shirts are not only funny but keep you entertained when you  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  on your  <START:Food> meal <END>  to come. and the  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  are the best around having the choice between spiked and not spiked  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  is nice  <START:Service> treat <END> . (try the Twinkie  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END> ) the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  is open so you see the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  and the grill so you know your  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in a clean  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . all in all the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  is nice and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are open LATE like a great Vegas strip  <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  should be!!!! thank you BLT and see you next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i am in Vegas
The house  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  alone are  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  a visit.  My favorite  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  are the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrata <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , the fresca  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with gorgonzola honey dressing, the Sorrento  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and pink alfredo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and the Amatriciana  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  (just a touch spicy).  Great date- <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>   <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  inside, and the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  area offers a casual option too.
I stopped in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on impulse en route to Hobby Lobby and upon seeing  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was 5:30 I realized I was in  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for the early bird  <START:Offers> specials <END>  for $8.99.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the six-oz Sirloin with two sides.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was aware in advance  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  ask you if you want  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  extra even though  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't tell you about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .The green  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were probably saltier than is  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in the "mushy" style, which I like fine, and had lots of good bacon pieces and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> caesar <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  couldn't have been much better, cold, crisp and crunchy with just the right amount of good dressing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  but awfully  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  to blend with the  <START:Food> meal <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  like a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  unto themselves, especially with the  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> .  I was impressed with the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  which was so thick  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was almost an ovoid.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  rare than  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare but I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  fine, too.  The impressive part was how nicely the  <START:S_Cutlery> knife <END>  cut through  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and how easy  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was to chew.  I've gotten  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  twice in the last few months from Outback for a couple dollars  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were so tough you couldn't stab  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with a fork, had to be a lumberjack to saw through  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  chewed like your grandmother's old shoe leather.    <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a real  <START:Service> treat <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  one and have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  be the way a good  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  should be.  I would come back easily, and hope I will sometime.  My only objection is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  constantly try to upsell you to  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> , etc.  The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was very nice and efficient, I just don't want the times I have to say No, thank you to outnumber the times I say Yes, please.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sets a tone of negativity in its own way.
A nice and affordable spot for a filling  <START:Food> breakfast <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , toast,  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> homefries <END> , and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  for under $10. My  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  almost immediately and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . My  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was also very  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and attentive. I will definitely make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a regular spot of mine.
First, I must disclose  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  being married to a Peruvian who is most demanding about about  <START:Food> anything <END>  culinary and, particularly Peruvian  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , I have come to be somewhat  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  demanding myself.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  being said, I would recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  even though I gave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only three  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . We sampled the chicha morada, a non-alcoholic  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  made from purple  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  with some  <START:F_Ingredients> citrus <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>  added, and were comforted to find  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fresh made (as opposed to mixed from powder).The papa a la huancaína ( <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  in a Huancayo style), a Peruvian staple presented in regional variations, was a good  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , its fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  noticeably tasty. For my own personal  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  I would have preferred a touch of spiciness, but hey,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would not be a valid reason to down  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> papa rellena <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  with a  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  filling) did not fare as well, the filling  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  a little on the greasy side.The seco de cordero, a sort of  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , came in a very generous  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  and did not disappoint. Again, the fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  carried the day!Unfortunately, we were to full to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , a project for another day.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was very good, even my picky spouse agreed  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>  of a return visit.
I have lived in the area for years and always passed  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  wondering what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was.  Finally, my Husband and I decided to give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a try...we had no idea what to expect.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is very intimate.  Some of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  are long with benched  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  so yes  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a possibility you may sit next to strangers.  But who cares when the  <START:Food> food <END>  is as YUMMY AS  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  IS!!!  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  pretty basic but has many options for a Pasties.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Carne Adovada  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was AMAZING!  My Husband got the Pesto  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  raved about how  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was (didn't try because I do not like pesto).  We ended with  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  some  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  caramel  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was to die for!
Blue Martini Loves the Ladies!! ....and we love you too! HAPPY  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  4-7PM DailyHalf-off  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> 
Came with a friend and his girlfriend on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  recommendation about 2 weeks ago for AYCE cuz  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the best in town. We all  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the all you can eat and began indulging in skewers,  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , nigiri and just about  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was just okay to me and on numerous occasions our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  forgot a few of our  <START:Food> items <END> . For the same  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  for AYCE I would rather go to Sumo  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  2, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's much closer to my house. The friends I went with who were raving about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  before we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  had even said the  <START:Food> food <END>  wasn't as good  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  around.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is cool, young and trendy with some good  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  playing. Not cool enough to get me to go back for AYCE though... Would only go back if I was invited by friends again. Nobody in Vegas can dethrone Sumo  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  2 for "Best AYCE in Vegas" in my honest opinion!
Worst pf changs I have ever been to. Sat down and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  were all over the  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  (dirty), then when the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  comes out my bowl was not clean, and lastly as my mother was eating our lo Mein  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  pulled out a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of paper!! GROSS!! At least the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  was nice enough to comp our  <START:Food> meal <END> , but at the same  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  insinuated we had put the  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of paper  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ??? Who knows. Just don't go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> !!!
Had been wanting to try The Outsider for awhile (saw  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  could do gluten free) and after soaking up some culture after day 2 at the museum, I had the chance.The blackboard  <START:Offers> specials <END>  looked promising and the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  did too with many  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  between £6.80 and £8.00 at  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END> .I had hoped to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with a  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  over to the castle as I had my mum visiting but we had a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at the front which turned out to be fab! The  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  are uber comfortable with masses of pillows.I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END>  in a  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END> , bacon and  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  and for a nice change  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came with  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . My mum ( <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was girly Jubilee weekend) had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly in a red  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fabulous (I didn't try as I'm Gluten Free and wasn't sure  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was safe).Both were huge  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  and we both loved our  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were tons of  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END>  (only a couple  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END> ) and the pail of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  seemed endless but fab with just the right amount of crispiness and some garlicky  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  seasoning.The Outsider was very busy -  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were friendly and seemed to cope. I would definitely return for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  as the  <START:Food> food <END>  is fab and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are reasonable (£4 a glass if  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , £2.50 for  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> ) but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a post museum  <START:Food> lunch <END> !
TERRIBLE!!!!!!! Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on my birthday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  ONLY cuz we we're staying at the Imperial Palace! Wish I'd have read the reviews ahead of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .... Spent $42 on an Old Country  <START:Food> buffet <END>  ripoff!! Terrible  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , uncomfortable  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> , poor  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> cuisine <END> ! DON'T GO!!!!!
A great  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of fresh and seasonal  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's pretty much something for everyone  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
 <START:Service> service <END>  was very good.  I was a little confused by  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  explained  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to me.  I was quite pleased with the  <START:Food> food <END> .  Much better than expected for the  <START:Restaurant> location <END>  (in a strip center).
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a mediocre  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Edible, but not great.  I won't throw a hissy-fit going  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but I wouldn't go out of my way to find  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Amazing! <START:Restaurant> this <END>  small  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Montreal had the most  <START:A_Env_Type> charming <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and extremely well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:Food> seafood <END> . I highly recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . You can select an assortment of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END> , clams, octopus, choosing just a few or a bit of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  each perfectly then brings out several  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  to complement your options. I have to say, the  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> was so good I didn't add much in the way of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I also didn't add any  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> , which for me is unheard of. (I went with my mother who is not a fan of salty  <START:Food> foods <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  too, so I promise  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not too salty.)The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  added fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> lemon <END>  zest, and was generous in pouring the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . Not to mention the entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly, entertaining, attentive, and welcoming. I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back!
I've never reviewed a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  before, but I really wanted to share my appreciation for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is my favourite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Waterloo and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is normally fantastic. On my most recent visit, one  <START:Food> item <END>  was slightly less superlative than usual, and when I commented on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  to the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  not only came to apologize but also gave me a voucher  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  significantly  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  than I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for my  <START:Food> meal <END>  in the first  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the best  <START:Service> service <END>  I have ever experienced, and in combination with the pleasant, sophisticated  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  and wonderful  <START:Food> food <END>  I would have no hesitation in unreservedly recommending the Bauer  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .
What can I say about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hasn't been said before? An amazing hidden culinary treasure,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  quaint  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  will have you coming back for  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END> . Family owned and French  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  inspired,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END>  I have had in Las Vegas.I first visited  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for a relaxed  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with my girlfriend while driving around town... And boy am I glad I did! Walking into  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you are immediately greeted with a warm  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  by the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  and by the sight of  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  and  <START:Service> treats <END> . From  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> panini <END>  to creamy and tasty  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has something for everyone.We started off with a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  pesto  <START:F_FoodItem> panini <END>  and a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , both of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  amazingly good. By the  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> of our  <START:Food> meal <END>  we could tell  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  is made fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  day (so the later you make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> , the slightly  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  limited your  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  might be) and prepared to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ! Please make sure to arrive hungry so you can try the peach or the pear  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> ... You will love  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> .Note:  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a bit difficult to find so refer to the yelp profile picture which has the accurate  <START:Restaurant> location <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Lastly, please beware  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  at 4pm, so  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spot.
So many  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  talk about the competitors around Sin City, but most of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  cannot even compare. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was endearing and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I also appreciate the fact  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  when the uni was not up to standards  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  warned us, gave us a  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , and did not hold  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  against us when we did not like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  either.For starters;  <START:F_FoodItem> baby tako <END> , soft shell  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> , and baked green  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END>  are the way to go. As for  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , many of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  come heavily  <START:F_Ingredients> sauced <END> . I am not the biggest fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , but the one's without kind of fell flat.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  need to meet somewhere in the middle. The Ugly was tasty, but three different  <START:A_Decor> dressings <END>  and the amount was overkill. The Sapporo Crunch  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was one  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  stuck out because of all the different kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . The generous amounts of  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END>  and less  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was much appreciated.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  hirame does not come with a ponzu or  <START:Food> anything <END> , so I could tell  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fresh.Now a  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> , I have turned into a senior citizen and eat  <START:Food> dinner <END>  around 5.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was nice to meet some of my Yelpie friends  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a late  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Even though I did not eat as much as I would if we had met earlier, I still left feeling full without feeling like dying. We sat until almost  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END>  and no one rushed us out. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  looks like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is ran by a family and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  definitely  <START:Service> treat <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  guests well. I would make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a regular haunt.
First  <START:Food> things <END>  first,  <START:Food> food <END> / <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was phenomenal (pretzels w/ multiple  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>   <START:S_Menu> choices <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  pot pie is out of control - ask for some tabasco to take  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to the next level)One problem - I was not sure for  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>  the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a gay  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ?? - the  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  (all dudes with schmedium t-shirts and the same crew cut) --  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is Las Vegas, not the castro, get with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and hire a few knockouts to get behind  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and do you proud
My boyfriend surprised me with two  <START:S_OpenHours> nights <END>  at TSR for our anniversary. I have reviews of our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and the spa but wanted to write a separate review for  our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at Orange Sky.As my other reviews stated,  <START:Service> service <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  overall is a bit mixed, maybe 2.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  at best. When we checked in at the desk on the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>   <START:A_Places> floor <END>  before going up to the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , the man at the desk asked for our name and asked what  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  our  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  were for. We gave him the information and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  asked again what our name was. I could clearly see were next on his list of names. We repeated  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and then  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  just said 'ok', and another man walked over and hit the button to the elevator. No smiles from either, no 'have a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END> '. Neither one of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  said  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  to us and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  almost felt like we were interrupting  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  conversation. Upon arriving on the 15th  <START:A_Places> floor <END> , the hostest informed us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  would be about 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  even though we were right on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . No big deal, we just took a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  in the  <START:A_Places> lounge area <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Our pre- <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  were okay but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was slow and without a smile.  What are these  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  so crabby about? In addition, rather than take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  after having the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> 's for 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  for what seemed like forever for 4 glasses of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  to be filled for another  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and chatted with the other  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END> . Luckily once we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  fairly quickly and we were able to have one  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  before our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was ready. Shortly thereafter, we were summoned to go with a hostest to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . We were lead through dancing couples on the dance  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and were sat in the second  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  from the front.  The hostest never offered to pull out our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a bit awkward to get into but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was cozy once you sat down with all the pillows. We did have a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the way the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  are positioned,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  makes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  feel very private... <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is unless you have a noisy group next to you on the other side of the divider. Ours weren't overly noisy but you could clearly hear  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were saying while we were busy eating.Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  friendly after striking up a conversation and all the  <START:Food> food <END>  was good. I had the  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END>  and the bf  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with the ribeye. Not  <START:Food> anything <END>  particularly memorable but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good. We were given a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  for our anniversary but can't say whether  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was free or not since I didn't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  :)  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good, some sort of  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  with hazelnuts with some very pretty penmanship wishing us happy anniversary.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the best  <START:Service> service <END>  related touch we had received the whole evening. We missed the sunset during  <START:Food> dinner <END>  which I'm sure would have added to the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  but watching highway traffic whiz by on the 101 after dark isn't overly romantic in my opinion. Even if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are mountains in the  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END> . Overall though, given the mediocer  <START:Service> service <END>  at the front, the standard  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  affair on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and lack of  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  past dark, I can't say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I would go back.If you do decide to go anyway, make sure you go early enough to catch the sunset!
Cheapest Mexican  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  in town!!!  Great  <START:Food> food <END>  and ok  <START:Service> service <END> .  The one on Gibson is the best in my book.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER  <START:Service> service <END> . (from " <START:Food> diners <END> , Drive-ins and Dives" to " <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible!") I understand slow/busy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  - but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was straight up rudeness and we were ignored for over 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .we walked in (just two of us) in front of a group of four or so  <START:S_Staff> people <END> . The group  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came in behind us sat behind us as well, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  before we even were acknowledged and got a glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> .We tried asking the male  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  continued past us (ignored us!) and helped the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  behind us, taking  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , bringing  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  several  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  then told us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the other  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  would help us. we were continued to be ignored.i felt  <START:Opinion> bad <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> ' first day, but the other  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was of no assistance to  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  (or us), which made the entire  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  look  <START:Opinion> bad <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  kept walking past our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  and check on the group  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came behind us. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and an additional 5 to get my  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> . we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  over a  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  (an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ) and about 50  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a "wee"  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Meanwhile the group  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came in behind us has had a "not so wee"  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> ), a couple  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , etc. and the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  kept bringing out  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  while we sat with one glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . The group of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  behind us finished and  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  as our fricking  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was coming out.the ONLY reason we didn't just walk away is human courtesy to the poor  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  first day.Looks like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  needs to be on  <START:Food> food <END>  network again for the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  " <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible!" because the male  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was a complete ass - either  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was racist and ignored my boyfriend. I literally saw him make eye contact as we asked for help and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  kept  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  moving to the group just past us... <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came in after us!I will never come back, and i will never tell my out of town guests to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
I was a tad disappointed by  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  considering all the hype I heard about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was wonderful, very pleasant and efficient.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good and if with a group, I would go back without whining. But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was pretty ordinary.  My  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was a tad overcooked but still had good  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were the same, nothing to write home about.  My  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  entitled black and white was really white, I think the waved the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  syrup bottle over the glass.  A little overpriced for my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ......
The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is lacking. Not many options to choose from. I probably will not go back.
Great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Hot  <START:Food> food <END>  which is increasing rare to be  <START:Service> served <END>  these  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> . Fresh and tasty,while the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  was  relaxing, sat on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  surrounded by tall palm trees lite with decorative  <START:A_Decor> lights <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>  was friendly and prompt. Great for larger groups of  <START:S_Staff> people <END> .
A regular stop of mine when traveling through CLT.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is regularly of good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , the takeaway  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  is great, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are friendly and my  <START:Service> service <END>  is always quick. My most recent stop in was just last week - picked up a  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  for takeaway as I only had 30m between connecting flights.  The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in an open area of the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  'between terminal  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> ' area so  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  isn't an enclosed  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  area - the closest you can get to  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  while being inside an airport terminal.  Being  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the customers are usually on the way to somewhere else, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are used to  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  at a pace to keep everyone moving  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems.  Not in a pushy way to get you out, just swift enough to keep you moving on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to your final destination.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  won't make you sick and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a refreshing change from the usual fare of deep-fried and greasy  <START:Food> food <END>  you get in airport terminals.
Please do not  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  me mealy  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ....I live in NODA and I really want to start to like the places in my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  so I don't have to drive far and can walk!! Came in and sat up at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . The front  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END>  is really beautiful (Old, wooden, big) the rest of the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is kinda like whatever...doesn't really look finished. Nice girl behind the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , asked  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  about some of the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  let me try two one being the Cask  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , which surprisingly I liked but I would've liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a little colder. I know, I know I'm a silly American!!  We started with a pretzel  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was barely warm, but the  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>  was good. Also had the homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  with  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were good but the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  had a weird  <START:Food> texture <END>  and was again not very warm. We then moved on and had the peel and eat  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came in a pint glass and I could smell  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  from the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  sat in for a while.... <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were  <START:Opinion> bad <END> , WARM, mealy, fishy, and mushy!! I took  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  and put  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  about a  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  away from me because I thought I was going to get sick from the smell! In an attempt to get the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> out of our mouths we decided on the  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . NO  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> at all, and once again not very warm!!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  being because the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were busy standing  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  talking and not ready to bring us our  <START:Food> food <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  all were staring right at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and continued to talk, then walked away, then came back for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! Very frustrating, I almost got up to get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  myself! I mean  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  way I would have had  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was hot.....well maybe!!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had maybe 5  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so not a very busy  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  I just thought  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  not being busy  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would've been better....I was wrong! The only saving grace to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  was when we got our check and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was thankfully not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  expensive!!
So we were trying to decide between a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of possible  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spots. A lot of our normal ones had been visited too recently or often, but somebody suggested to go for the non-usual Thai and specifically directed us  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .Not a  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  choice.We sat down at first, then we decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to-go in the interest of saving  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I had my eye on the $7.95  <START:Food> lunch <END>  special and settled on a  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  pad thai.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  (fresh),  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  (decent, not salty or  <START:F_FI_Taste> bland <END> ),  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:Food> cream <END>  (well... no,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't for to-go, wtf?) and two potstickers (good). While I haven't  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the regular option for comparison purposes, the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I got looked like a full  <START:Food> meal <END> , not reduced for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .Besides the lack of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:Food> cream <END> , my only real issue was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the fork tines were a little too small to make good work of the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a little difficult to eat. The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was a little chewy, but not too  <START:Opinion> bad <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was actually  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I anticipated, so I wound up eating a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and rationing  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  toward the end. Regardless, I'd definitely consider  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  again for a quick local Thai fix.
Came on a Saturday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  around 7 and were sat immediately.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a  <START:A_Env_Size> smaller <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  capable of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  15 or so and about 15  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . I'm not sure if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a nightly occurrence but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a gentleman playing on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> piano <END>  and a young  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>   <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> singing <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  provided a nice  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> .The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  consists of apps,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , a few  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We had the stuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  as an app and weren't too impressed.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  weren't terrible, just nothing special. The  <START:Food> entrees <END>  were a different story. My husband's  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lasagna <END>  was to die for.  Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with just the right amount of each  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> veal parm <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  hit the spot.Veal was tender and had just the right amount of breading.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> marinara <END>  is homemade and fantastic. I could've eaten  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with a spoon all on its own. The  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  was quite generous and was accompanied by  <START:F_FoodItem> spaghetti <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> marinara <END> . Our only compliant was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do not offer draft  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  bottled  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was very limited.While many  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  are not listed on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  informed us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> marsalas <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> piccatas <END>  are available upon request.
I was pretty skeptical about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  at first, since all the  <START:Food> item <END>  descriptions were pretty plain.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  turned out to be really flavorful and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , though!The  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is really  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> -y with just the right amount of  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  didn't overpower all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . We also had the braised  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  shoulder which was really tender and well-seasoned. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  on top was a really nice contrast in  <START:Food> texture <END>  and gave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a refreshing  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . Being serenaded by the live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the canal was nice, despite the loud gaggles of Asian tourists snapping photos with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  iPads.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was almost a 4- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  review, but I am docking a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for the following reason:The  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came out while my boyfriend was in the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> , so I put my card in and  <START:O_Payment> paid <END> . When the check came back out for us to sign, the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  / host ( <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was checking  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  in but was also checking on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , so I assume  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was some kind of  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> ) handed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to my boyfriend and said, "Thank you, Stephen."  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  may have been an innocent mistake, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  definitely came off as misogyny.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the 21st century - women are allowed to pick up the tab once in a while. Poor form!
I am so disappointed. Let me preface  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  with saying the  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>   <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , who took our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for take out was really, really friendly. Somehow the  <START:S_Staff> driver <END>  got the wrong address and went to the neighbors' house, but as luck would have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , I was  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and caught him.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was also super  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> .Now, the  <START:Food> food <END> . We like our  <START:Food> food <END>  HOT. HOT! Our  <START:S_Staff> gal <END>  had asked on a scale of 1-5 hot how did we like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . We said 10. We eat ghost  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . We like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  HOT.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  laughed and said ok, no problem. The  <START:Food> food <END>  came quickly (and we are a bit away). We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rangoon puffs <END> , Hunan  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and hot and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . Sadly, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was not good at all. Not terrible, but not good. When we  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  hot, we expect  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  to be used.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  used  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  in the Hunan  <START:Food> dish <END>  and the hot and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was SOOOO greasy I had to wash the lids off of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was everywhere. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was not hot AT ALL. The Hunan  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> of the  <START:Food> dish <END>  would have been good, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was SOAKED in  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> . The hot and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  had so much  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was floating on top. And  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . I am used to at least some  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> . Just  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was thick, which I like, but I had to scrape the  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  off the top. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rangoon puffs <END>  were tasty, but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came with no  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . And the  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  came with the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in a container by itself, with the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on the side. Fine. I get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't want  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  mushy when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  got  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was ONLY  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in the container. No  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> , no  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , no  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> , just the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was ok. But nothing to mix in with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> .I give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rating <END>  a 2 because the  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>  was EXTREMELY nice, and even called us back to apologize for the  <START:S_Staff> driver <END>  having the wrong address and stating  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  wanted to update  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  system so  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  right the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . When  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  called, after we had eaten, we told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  our  <START:Food> food <END>  was NOT spicy at all, as promised, but said next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  would do better.I will give  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  another chance because of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  customer  <START:Service> service <END>  and how lovely the  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>  was. But let's hope  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  doesn't come with a pound of  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  in and on  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . I am so disappointed. I was excited to try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  turned out to be like almost all of the Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in town.Dear Golden  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> ,Please, please, please! Use  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> , NOT  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> . And add something to your  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> . Because the  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  itself was pretty tasty. And your customer  <START:Service> service <END>  was so wonderful. :( :(
My friends and I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to try  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  prefixe  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Week; however, we  <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  a bit too late and missed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Instead, the three of us shared the grilled octopus for the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END>  for  <START:Food> entree <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  dark  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  Nutella flourless  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  great and  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were perfect  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  for three  <START:S_Staff> people <END> .The octopus and  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  very well, both prepared with  <START:F_Ingredients> lemon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> capers <END> . Some  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  have complained about the bones in the  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were removed when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  to us. We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came out to $100 each including tip. If you don't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the signature  <START:Food> dishes <END>  for the  <START:Food> entree <END> , you can walk over to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  little " <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  market" and choose something else to be  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  up for you. Thought  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was interesting. I would definitely come back and try something  from  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Love how  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  is fresh!
So so so good! I had the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and I enjoy  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> ! Great design of a  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . So well done.
The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I tried Spinato's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was when my friend introduced me to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with carryout over the summer.  We went with the thin  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and I really enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was in town I stopped in and tried the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  itself, and really had a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .I don't know what  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was before, but I swear  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be a  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> 's. I could be wrong, but either way, its really well  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END> .  Warm well  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END>   <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  with a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and a great  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Lots to choose from, and not just  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  (even though its  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  specialty.)I really like the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Not overstated, but classy enough  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you can take your parents  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and not have  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  freak out like mine do.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  feels like a great date spot too.   <START:Service> service <END>  was great, and I really had a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I had were tasty.  I would come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again in a heartbeat. Check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out,  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the trip if you want something different and want to have a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review is courtesy of my fellow yelpers.Typed in " <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ", "Las Vegas", and "Highest Rated" and Carlo's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  popped up.Eh, why not? Great reviews and the fan photos really helped making the final dining decision very easy.Inside of Charlie's  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , say what? Who would have known such a  <START:Food> stellar <END>   <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  could be found nestled inside of a typical Vegas pub? Yelpers,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's who!No sooner did my party get sat our very attentive  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came to grab our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> .  Glasses never empty and our palates totally satisfied we thoroughly enjoyed our  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at Carlos.From succulent  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  chops to perfectly seasoned  <START:F_FoodItem> fettuccine <END>  and a goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  fritta  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  will make you want thirds, you will not be disappointed.Take away the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  aspect of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  the point has been made  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  is out of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  world; lets get to my most favorite part of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .. The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  in charge of all  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  leave the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  personally came out to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ! Not only did  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  come out to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us at the beginning of our  <START:Food> meal <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  checked on our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  of (7) after our feeding frenzy came to a  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to follow up.A brilliant display of customer  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I honestly thought was completely lost in  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  city.Thank you Carlo's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  for bringing back the feel of an old world dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  where  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  feels like the entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  actually gives a crap about creating a positive dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .You will see us again for sure!
I just moved to Charlotte and I'm very happy to announce... I've found my brunch  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Terrace  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  is the bomb.com and I know I will definitely be back to try some of the other  <START:Food> things <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I live in Rock Hill but drove to Ballantyne in search of some yummy brunch. I had tried  a couple hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  places near Rock Hill but none were  <START:Food> anything <END>  to write home about.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  most definitely did not disappoint.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a Monday morning, so I can't really comment on what the weekend  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  is like but we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  immediately. The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  was nice; trendy but casual. Good for girlfriends, a brunch date with your significant other or even  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  with the kids.  <START:Service> service <END>  was pretty good. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  checked in a few times and our  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  in a good amount of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .I started with a Salted Caramel Latte. YUM. I saw  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon bloody mary <END> , but I'm going to save  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  for a Sunday Funday. For the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> . DAMN. The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  were out of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  world. The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh and fluffy, while the  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  was definitely homemade and very flavorful. The  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  were a little salty, but I like salty.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were also very crisp.  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  was fresh a good  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> grapes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> raspberries <END>  - I don't really like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  average  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  with just melon &  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> , so I was pleased. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  also had some very interesting  <START:Food> items <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Benedict, Buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and a Red Velvet Waffle  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I would love to try.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  may be a little premature to say  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the best  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  in Charlotte but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a solid standby. If you're looking for a  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .
Love love love Dim Sum needed a fix and didn't want to drive across town to get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  So we pull up and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't open till  <START:S_OpenHours> 10:30 <END>  : / my  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  for not checking first.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a farmers market on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  day right down the way.  So we wasted some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  until  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  opened.Starving by the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we get in and I know better the to be some of the first few customers for DimSum : /   The  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was nill to none again my  <START:Opinion> bad <END> .  So we got a few of our favorites and by the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the good stuff was coming out we were full.The  <START:Food> food <END>  we did have was good, very flavorful and prepared well.  The  <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  of the Dim Sum  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we got seemed larger then normal.  The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were a bit  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  expensive then China Town but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is in a higher rent district, so understandable.I don't know if I will be back but in a pinch I would.
We choose a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  for consistency but when the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is full of the part no one wants to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  ruins the whole  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Please cut the fat, literally!
Had the country fried  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was awesome! Red velvet  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  with the  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  syrup!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the definition of the American Diet. Huge  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  for really heavy  <START:Food> foods <END> . Out of all the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , we really liked the philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> & <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . We'd stay away from the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> . Huge  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Who doesn't want  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  in Vegas.
padlocked and  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  with an eviction notice taped to the front  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END>  is quite  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to work, and at times when morale is low or  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  feels like  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's been kind of a jerk lately, the boss will get us a couple  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  from Frank's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . I have had some regular old pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in the past, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were definitely better than average. But the famed buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .... Oh boy. The  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  is flavorful and at the perfect level of chewiness, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  chunks are large and tender, the buffalo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is spicy and not too greasy, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  blankets all in wonderfulness. Then you get sides of  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's homemade!  Thick and rich and you can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  all the lovely dill  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 've put in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the best dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  ever.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was so good  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I felt indebted to the  <START:S_Staff> boss man <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  wonderful  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  and volunteered to stay late. Perhaps  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will be positive reinforcement and  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 'll buy me  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  often.
Hands down the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  on the strip. Wicked Spoon is amazing, but Baccahanal blows even  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  out of the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . I can't imagine coming to Vegas again and not eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
Had  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .
Stayed at Encore. Andrea's was the best  <START:Food> meal <END>  on our trip. The  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  were the best. The rock  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  and the mango  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , and the strip  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  with wasabi Demi glaze was also very good. Definitely coming back !
The  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  expert in me wants to cringe when I eat the  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> . LOL But I also know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I'm not in Japan or California, and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is probably better than most  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  places in Tempe.Well,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's better than Republic  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> ... if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is saying much? However,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's probably from the same  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  of Republic  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END> , the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and the style is just too similar. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just as expensive. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> .... no  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was $8. Additional  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  are at least $1 per  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is ridiculous.I don't know where these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  learned to make  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  but please.... no  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  ruins the  <START:Food> texture <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> of the  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END> . I don't even want to ask why  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  available as a  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END> . I'll just get annoyed. -______-Better off going back to Cherry Blossoms for  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  (which actually  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like Japanese  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> ).
Best Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  ever! I have been going to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for years and i love the new  <START:Restaurant> location <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  just the same and I wish I could go  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  day.I always get the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  mango quesadilla.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is very popular for a reason ;)
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ....I really am a fan of Gus' s  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ...The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is awesome.   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is fast and very clean!! Hope you get to enjoy Gus' s  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  soon!!!
Wow!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is absolutely incredible! I came in on a Thursday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't super packed, Senator Harry Reid had just came in with his wife to eat. One of the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  was so amazing and I had some of the best  <START:Service> service <END> . I split the Combo Special and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was so good, but did have a lot of  <START:Food> food <END> . We got complimentary  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  on the house and THE PITA  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  WAS UNBELIEVABLE!  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's house made and cannot be missed. Definitely coming back for  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END> !!!

I accidentally scheduled a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  at LaVecchia during  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  week, which frankly could have been a recipe for disaster.  As I'm new to  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> , I wound up looking for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  at the old  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> , sweetheart that  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was, told me  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 'd meet me in the lobby of the new  <START:A_LocatedArea> building <END>  to make sure we found  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .I'm sure the comments previous to mine related to  <START:Service> service <END>  are valid.   However, that was not the case for me.  We got two differing copies of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  week  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> , and our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  merely looked at  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  briefly before telling us to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  whatever we'd like off of either and  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 'd handle  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were also out of the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  brought us a better bottle and charged us the less  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> .   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was attentive but not intrusive throughout and more or less fell all over herself to make sure we knew how much  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  appreciated we were understanding of the "mistakes".   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's rare for a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  to go so above and beyond to make sure I'm happy.The  <START:Food> food <END> - decent for upscale.  I had  <START:F_FoodItem> calamari <END>  (average) and a  <START:F_FoodItem> ribeye <END>  that was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  exactly like a medium-rare  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  should be.  My dining partner had  <START:F_FoodItem> tilapia <END> , and I will not judge a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  based on the presentation of that boring ass  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem>   almond   crust <END>  and an appealing  <START:F_FoodItem>   chili   relish <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>  along merited a return trip.  I'm looking forward to seeing if the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> merits the rating <END> .
I love  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , and I love the Brooklyn  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  are a beautiful combination atop the thin crust,  <START:F_Ingredients> tomato   sauce   <END> , and  <START:F_Ingredients> mozzarella substrate <END> . All the  <START:F_FoodItem> pies <END>  are excellent actually,  <START:F_FoodItem> monstrous calzones <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  too.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  because I just don't think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were going for that sort of thing,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  certainly won't break your  <START:A_Places> bank <END>  with under $7  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and average  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> . Possibly better than actual New York  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , but I'll leave that up for debate.
I used to like their foodHonestly. <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was my one year anniversary.Me and me man went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to celebrateI had a  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  tailAnd a filetOn the way home, I got violently illLike, within ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  of leaving  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> .And no, I only had a few glasses of  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  :)I ended up going home, and laying on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etcAfter about an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> , I couldn't take  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  anymoreI called 911The paramedics showed up, I was naked and crying on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END> . <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a VERY romantic anniversary, let me tell you.After a long night at Scottsdale Osborn hospital,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was determined that the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  tail was undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill.I'll never eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.Simply because I've never been so sick. <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a shame though, because on the way down, the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  tail had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally delicious.HOWEVERI contacted Ruths Chris and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  refunded my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  amount,  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  my hospital copay, and were SOOO nice and accomodating to my every demand.  Bravo.Although, Boo for almost killing me.Eh, I'm torn.
I have lived  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  since 1984 and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was the first  <START:A_Places> place <END>  I ever ate in Arizona as a 5 year old. I keep coming back for more over and over again. I crave  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  constantly! I get the simple  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's super hot on a hot  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and still  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  the same after all these years. Best  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  you will every have as well. Massive  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  is always a bonus. Not giving  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  due to the inside not have been touched in probably 30 years. Needs to be updated a tad, but other than that... <START:Food> food <END>  wise,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's my favorite mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  in AZ. :)
I chose to have a happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> snack <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a couple of days ago.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had been a while since I was a patron  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and some  <START:F_FoodItem> hummus <END>  sounded amazing at the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . And, as always, the  <START:F_FoodItem> hummus <END>  (all 3) was excellent. I opted to sit on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  overlooking the lake that sits just across a small patch of grass and a concrete pathway. "How did  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  pond get  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?" I thought for just a moment...then decided I didn't care because my black  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was being brought out to me.The  <START:Service> service <END>  is almost always amazing. The guest ducks, unfortunately, have been trained by those with lesser wills to beg  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> -side for some scraps from your  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> , and subsequently  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  all over the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining   area   <END>   <START:A_Places> floor <END> . All I hear from the white duck is 'quack quack!', which I assume in duckinese means 'more  <START:F_FoodItem> hummus <END> ', but I can't be too sure. I don't even know Spanish. Other than the pandering ducks, my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was very good again. Looking forward to the next visit!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a perennial favorite of my husband and I. We love the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and juicy slabs of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  we can choose from. Their  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  also has a nice vibe to  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  when the weather cools off some, the fireplace prevents things from getting too chilly during our short fall and winter seasons. My favorite has always been the prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> , medium rare almost to the outer edges with a generous helping of  <START:F_FoodItem> horseradish <END>  and au jus. I also can't eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  without the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  Neptune. We  <START:S_Staff> each <END>  get an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to avoid sharing.
I love Liberty Market. I grew up in Gilbert and remember when  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was a small  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery   store   <END> . I've been wanting to check  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  out since the conversion and I'm so glad I finally stopped by.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was perfect.  <START:Restaurant>   this place <END>   just feels like home. Casual, but warm. When we walked in my friend and I were lost and didn't know where to start. Luckily one of the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  quickly handed us  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  and told us where to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . I had a couple of  <START:F_Ingredients> caramel iced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lattes <END>  and the Liberty Bowl. I loved both. The Liberty Bowl came with 4 big  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  in marinara  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and and two slices of toasted  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so hard narrowing down my  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were so many delicious looking  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but I resisted. Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I think I'll just give in and have a  <START:F_FI_Size> slice <END>  of red velvet or  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> , or a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  or a  <START:F_FI_Size> slice <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> zucchini <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  or a sticky  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> . So much to choose from. I would love to come back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and have a  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and sit and enjoy the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  at the  <START:F_Dessert> espresso <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Loved all the different  <START:A_Decor> themes <END>  in the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  stalls. You have to check  <START:S_Staff> each <END>  one out. Joe was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and stopped by  <START:S_Staff> each <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to see how  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was doing. We spent so much  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  chatting and catching up.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  to come and hang out. I will be back soon.
What a breath of  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:A_Env_AC> air <END> ! Finally, a market concept done RIGHT! Awesome branding, excellent design,  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I felt so at home! The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing:  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  deli  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> , cranberry, Brie with a  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  tang of  <START:F_FoodItem> horseradish <END> . And the sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  new try. I love how every detail was addressed: well, but not oversized  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  mugs,  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  china, even the  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  station had the perfect set of utensils for my self- <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . One  <START:F_FoodItem> critique <END>  would be  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ends at 11a on weekdays and 1p on weekends. As an avid  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  all-day advocate,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  disappoints me. Think about extending those  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END> ! LGO did  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  success. Overall, HUGE fan. If you haven't gone, check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out!!
Lali J. and I took a  <START:A_OutsideView> road <END>  trip to Tokyo Lobby last night. We'd heard about  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  through excellent reviews in the New  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and the Republic (a positive review in the Republic is often a neon sign that says "stay away," but we decided to risk  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ). As a transplanted New Yorker/San Franciscan/Los Angeleno, I have to say Tokyo Lobby has been my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in the valley. If you're used to Ra or any of the other McSushi  <START:A_Places> places <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the schlep up to North Glendale (which is almost as far as the Yukon from where we live) to check  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  out.T.L. is a small, 10  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  joint, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's crowded in a vibrant, fun way.  <START:Service> service <END>  is fast and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's in a strip mall, but if you keep your eyes left of center as you approach from the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot, you won't see the WalMart on your right. The usual/ <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  suspects are brilliant -- stunning unagi, maguro, tobiko, etc. The sides and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  were fab, too:  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  seaweed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and gyoza. Tokyo Lobby is creative with the specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  -- the Marilyn Mon- <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  (not kidding) was terrific: a spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  wrapped in albacore with an elegant  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>  of crispy/crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> . <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's also a full  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of earthbound  <START:F_Ingredients> flesh <END>  and assorted other goodies.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  looked  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . Really -- check  <START:Restaurant>   this place <END>  out!
The  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent (maybe because I went when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  weren't that many people  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was AMAZING! I had the veal raviolli.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  gamey at all, and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was amazing. i love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> !
Pros:  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . Open 24/7 .  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  phó. Phone  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  easy to go . The red been  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  is awesome! Over all good  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END> .Cons: hit or miss with the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Sometimes I feel rushed .
Last week - I dropped by the Aloha  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Had high hopes that  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would be a  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  that would come  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to being like the  <START:Food> food <END>  I love and miss when I'm back home on the islands. However - I've learned to live with disappointment in life and my visit  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was just another added to that list. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining   area   <END>  is nice - somewhat clean, open and modern(ish) compared to other "local" style  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  I've been to. The names of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were promising and the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  seemed in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  with the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  I had seen on people's  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  as I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to  <START:A_Places> place <END>  my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . I was coming down with a cold so I wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> saimin <END>  - even with  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  being in the 90's and humid which  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't  <START:S_Staff> serve <END> . A Hawaiian style  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that doesn't  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> saimin <END>  - odd. Even fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joints in Hawaii  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> saimin <END> .  At least  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  fried  <START:F_FoodItem> saimin <END> . So, I settled for that. Too much  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  which normally isn't a bad thing however, after a few  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END> , I started to separate the  <START:F_Ingredients> cabbage <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> celery <END> . Sorted thru and picked out the minced  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and with the leftover  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked like I hadn't made a dent in the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . I also chose a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Ugh. All I'm going to say is that I have to wonder if the  <START:S_Staff> cooks <END>  have ever been to the islands. Either that or the  <START:S_Staff> cooks <END>  have started tayloring their  <START:Food> dishes <END>  to the  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  of people who haven't been either. Or maybe, I didn't choose the right  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  specialize in ... whatever the case, I didn't like what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and I doubt I'll be back any  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  soon.
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's easily one of my favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> .The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a beautiful  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a very intimate  <START:A_Environment> setting <END>  and is a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Ambience> spot <END>  for a romantic date night. But  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  still manages to maintain a simplistic charm. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is absolutely delicious. I usually get the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> , and recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wholeheartedly. The  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list is extensive and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is wonderful. No complaints.
Went during  <START:Food> lunch <END>  over the weekend, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was easily one of the very best Indian  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  I've had a chance to eat at.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  was delicious, as were all of the vegetarian options  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  Whereas  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't seem a major thing, the condiment  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ;  <START:F_FoodItem> chutneys <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> raita <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> kheer <END> , etc, was one of the most complete I've seen.Will head  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again.
the discovery of  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  in 2004 forever changed my tastebuds.  since  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  now, i can finally review based on the  <START:Restaurant> store <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  first  <START:S_OpenHours> opened <END>  and i fell in love with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , and not after the shady change in business  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  where i boycotted the last year or so anyway.$5 for delicious  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  of dumplings, either  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> , either  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  or spicy.  i always got spicy half and half (half  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> , half  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ), never with sour cream tho cuz i don't like the stuff.  just 1 extra dollar for a  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was among the cheapest, most filling dinners in  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> .  as a campus "safewalker," i stopped  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  nearly every night i worked for my  <START:Food> dinner <END> .before  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END> , i bought up several  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  for freezing (which  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  let you do), and rationed  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  out for months after their  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  let me in on the secret for the spicy  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> .~ <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> ~a little  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  vinegar~cilantro~ <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  powder~srirachatop that with a piece of pumpernickel, and you have nothing short of pure magic.  5 years later i still have dreams about  <START:Restaurant>   this place  <END> , and once even tried requesting a  <START:F_FoodItem> pel meni <END>  mold for my birthday (still  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  on one of those - HINT HINT people)!when i moved to boston, i was thrilled to find a russian  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery store <END>   that had frozen  <START:F_FoodItem> pel meni <END> .  tho i have tried both their packaged and their home-made  <START:S_Menu> varieties <END> , nothing has come  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the madison gem.original  <START:F_FoodItem> pel meni <END>  genious  - if you're reading, please PLEASE come to boston!  i will eat  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at your  <START:Restaurant> store <END>  and bring throngs to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  mecca - just please make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dream a reality!  i suppose i'd settle on just learning your  <START:F_FoodItem> pel meni <END>  recipe if nothing else...
Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for brunch yesterday (Sat) ... two words, stay away!Yes, the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  look  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  ... but if  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  good Indian  <START:Food> food <END>  you're looking for, Taj is a big let down. The brunch  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was sparse, most  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down ( <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  nothing like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  should),  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  & to make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  worse - my glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  had stuff floating in  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .
Working in the Capitol  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  for 15 years, La Canasta Capitolio is a must.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are very few  <START:A_Places> places <END>  to eat near the Capitol, but La Canasta not only provides a  <START:A_Places> place <END>  for a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat, but some good  <START:Food> food <END>  as well. I don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , so I generally stick to the red  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , which is very good.   <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are reasonable, too. I think their  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  business comes from the government workers in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> , and lot's of police and fifi's (firefighters).  If the PD and fifi's eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  must be good.  Free  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  (very GOOD  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> ) is a definite plus! Also, I've heard their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> 's are excellent.
I was visiting Arizona from New York & came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to celebrate my dear friends birthday. We also came to see another friend perform with his  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> band <END> . The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  are all very handsome  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  & really gorgeous "pin up" girl looking ladies. I am not a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  drinker. I love  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  but I get the bubble guts when I  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  (yeah, i know TMI). Anyway,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very intimidating to hear that we were going to a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . However, the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was super sweet & accomadating.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  actually recreated a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  for me called a " <START:F_Drinks> cherry bomb <END> " that I had at Blue Wasabi which is my new favorite  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Of course,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't exactly the same but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was still pretty good. I was really impressed with the fact that the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  went out of  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  way to get me something that I could  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  even stopped me at one point & said " I feel like you are not happy. I really want to make you happy". That was so super sweet of  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  & I gave  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  a very good tip for all of  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  efforts.I didn't try the  <START:Food> food <END> .The  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  &  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  & live  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> band <END>  are  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  seeing.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ia a bit pricey so be prepared to spend some money. Also, the  <START:A_OutsideView> entrance <END>  is in the back of the club so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is hard to find  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Thank God my friend came out to get us.I will definitely be back in the future if  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  permits  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .
I am sitting  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  as I type  <START:Restaurant> this <END> .  My wife,  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  parents and I were visiting from out of  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  and decided to drop by an " <START:Food> italian <END>  deli" for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  Firstly  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is closer to a deli you'd find on New York rather than one in Italy.  In  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , I heard two people  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  fettuccine Alfredo for  <START:Food> lunch <END> ... So,  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> :  one  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  (one if the few  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ),  one  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , one portobello  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and one  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  panini.  While I was  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> ,  the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  ( the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) kept giving me an odd look...like "who do you think you  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?"  I also got a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  which was on display.  When I asked for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ,   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  didn't know what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so I had to  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  him the bottle.  Also, the request to have a double  <START:F_Dessert> espresso <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  made later seemed to give him and an associate all kinds of inconvenience.   <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's what we got:The  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was good albeit a bit greasy.The  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was OK.The portobello  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  NEVER arrived.  Instead we got another half of a  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  When I told  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  to the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said "If you want portobello I'll make you one."  No apologies no cares.   When  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  finally came out,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was bad.The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  panini (which had  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  in  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !) was nasty.When I went to ask for a  <START:S_Cutlery> knife <END> ,  the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  said that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  should be out by the  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  machine.  I informed him  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were not.   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  screamed for 'Ernesto to bring out the  <START:S_Cutlery> knives <END> " and told me "the should be out soon, I THINK".  Also got first apology of the day.The  <START:F_Dessert> espresso <END>  was atrocious.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's beyond words how bad  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is.   Really awful. Seriously.Finally,  to add injury to insult, we were overcharged 50c .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was explained as a computer error.  We got the money back.Will NEVER return.
a friend of our's found  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  on Yelp, saying  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the #2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  so we had to give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a try since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to where we live.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's in a strip mall and I would never have expected a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  to exist  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is nice.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a pri fix  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for $55 which includes 1  <START:Food> entree <END>  and 2 something else ( <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , or  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ). Our favorite  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  (  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  told us  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a signature  <START:Food> dish <END> ). The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was the favorite for the  <START:Food> entree <END>  and for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  exactly like a warm  <START:F_Ingredients> almond <END>  joy. YUMM,  <START:Restaurant>   this place <END>   also gave out little extra  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  at the end (  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chocololate <END> , peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  balls, and lemon thing) That's a nice touch to end the  <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was impeccable, almost better than any on the strip  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !
Before eating at Hikari, I have tried only two other all you can eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  joints. Todai in Honolulu, and Midori  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in Los Angeles. In a fight between the 3 I think Hikari wins hands down. I had 4 pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> hamachi <END> , 4 uni, 4  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> , 2  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , 2  <START:F_FoodItem> ikura <END> , 1  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  must have been a good catch  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had come in because  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and melt in your mouth  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was really good too!With a ratio of 5 to 1 I think the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  had a really good memory for the amount of  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had to deal with too.I will definitely be back when I go Vegas again... I may even write another review; Regardless of the fact that reminiscing of the  <START:Food> food <END>  creates so much hunger pain.
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> ! The bakery is in the front. But walk down the aisle on the side of the bakery and you will discover a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . A trattoria. Sit down. Relax.  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . A  <START:Food> dish <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> . Or a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  to dip your biscotti in.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  mixes and matches in the back. Ask for Larry- the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> !
The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was pretty nice when we first stepped in.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  accommodated to our party of ten in a reasonable  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Upon  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and a few bottles of $10  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . The catch is that you have to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  $10 of  <START:Food> food <END>  in  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to take advantage of the deal. Then the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  began. The  <START:Food> food <END>  took what seemed like forever and a day, I was thinking about eating the  <START:F_FI_Size> slice <END>  of lemon in my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   to stave the hunger. However, when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  finally came I was surprised at the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  of some of the  <START:Food> meals <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and what came out did not resemble  <START:Food> anything <END>  like a  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a bunch of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  thrown onto a tortilla and that was  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I've had better attempts of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  at Rubio's.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was a true testament that sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's better to get  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  then  <START:F_FI_Size> quantity <END> . We had  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  of S'mores and that was probably their only saving grace. Although  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's nothing more than your normal  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , but the fact that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Service> served <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  made the end a little more tolerable.
Well, if I recall correctly,  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's three types of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , a few  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , a few types of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>   and a few  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  on tap, but one  <START:S_Staff> bartendress <END>  that made us come back more than once. What  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . :)Also, I was eating too much  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and needed to get back to earth and not be too addicted to Vegas. The  <START:S_Staff> bartendress <END>  looked like a trained  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> dancer <END> , I wished I remembered to ask  <START:S_Staff> her <END> . Which reminds me,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a whole lot of trained theater  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> dancers <END>  in Vegas. Five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for that.
3 and 1/2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a build a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  type  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , named #2  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  joint in Las Vegas.  You pick your type of  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  including kobe, sustainable, sirloin, etc and other including  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> , etc.  Then you can pick your  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  -  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> , sesame, whole wheat, ciabatta, etc,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheeses <END>  - pepperjack, swiss, american, cheddar, etc, and fixings:   <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , etc,  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  -  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END> , shallot reduction, etc.Some  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are already built for you and you got your schmancy ones including a $60  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , etc.Pick your side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> :  Skinny,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> .First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I picked the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  which was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , but I don't remember too much about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .Second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a sustainable on wheat w/swiss  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and shallot reduction.. honestly,  <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END>  didn't have much  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  didn't either so my  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  pretty  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> .  Good  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and small TV for  <START:S_Staff> each <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> .  While the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  for a typical  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  isn't through the roof, (around $20) your best bet if you're pinching your wallet would be the slider  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , three cute sliders w/ <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  for only $12.95.
Whether  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just for a couple  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , a lite  <START:Food> lunch <END>  or for a full  <START:Food> dinner <END> , Mesa Grill is always a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Menu> choice <END> .The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has a vast array of Southwestern flavored  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  should be something on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> . We have eaten  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  on several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and have yet to be disappointed. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is very attentive and professional and simply add to the enjoyment of your  <START:Food> meal <END> .The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  right in the heart of Caesars Palace, so  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  to enjoy a  <START:Food> meal <END>  and then go catch a  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  or enjoy some  <START:A_Entertainment> gaming <END> . Definitely  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  checking out.
 <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Week Review I have to preface  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review with,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is my first visit  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  specifically for  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  week, the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .Original plan was to sit  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  on the nice terrace overlooking the Bellagio  <START:A_Decor> fountains <END> , but the weather prevented us from doing that, so the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  sat us next to the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> , which was perfect. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  suggested 2 of his favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  specialties from the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , I wish I could remember the names of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were so good.For my app I went with Crispy Lamb Riblets; Sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> raita <END> , Lamb Reduction, Honeyed Yogurt, Micro  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was delicious. And rather large for an app,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , a little crunch on the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and tender on the inside. My friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Wild  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  Tart; Caramelized  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , Herbed Imported Goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>  Essence.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  also was delicious, had the perefect amount of every  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END> .We both chose the same  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  course, Pacific Sole Milanese; Creamy Fava  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END> , Garlicky  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> , Lemon  <START:F_Ingredients> caper <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  Emulsion, Shaved Fennel Insalata.  Right away I noticed  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked greasy, I think the combination of the Milanese with the  <START:F_Ingredients> caper <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  emulsion made  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  very heavy and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  covered the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the Sole. I kept having to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  after every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  under the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , so that's what I ended up eating. Dissapointed because I ended up not eating the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .We both chose the same  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  as well, Tiramisu Cannoli; Cinnamon Spiced  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> espresso <END>  cream.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was a different twist on tiramsu, which is one of my favorite  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had a good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , nothing spectacular.
Id give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  3 1/2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  werent for the LONG  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> lines <END>  and bitchy  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  was fair and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was pretty good.  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  at 1:30pm on a Monday for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Tried to go to  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at 6pm the night before but the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  was out into the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  and although we didnt  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  prob would have been at least 90  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  or longer. At one point I went to scoop some  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  onto my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  but the only  <START:S_Cutlery> spoon <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  was slotted;/ so I borrowed the sppon next to  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  (which was not in  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> ) and the man behind the sneeze glass came unglued!!! LOL  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  shouted "why you not ask me for different  <START:S_Cutlery> spoon <END> ? Now  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  all contaminated and I cannot  <START:S_Staff> serve <END> !!!!" I apologized but suggested  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wasnt standing  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  when I needed the  <START:S_Cutlery> spoon <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  silly to put a slotted  <START:S_Cutlery> spoon <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wasnt listening and didnt care as  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was too busy acting like an overdramatic little bitch.  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> , rotisserie  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> ......decent  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  for B, L & D (approx $15, $20, and $30). Be prepared to eat off schedule  <START:Food> meals <END>  or  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in a long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> .
Our  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  was awesomely delicious. And that's coming from someone who generally avoids junk  <START:Food> food <END>  altogether. After the first  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  my husband and I agreed we need to come back to La Creperie the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we're in Vegas.
 <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  and the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were solid.  Would have given add'l  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  if the  <START:Service> service <END>  was kicked up a couple notches.  For a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  caliber, overall  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was par at best.Marketing side note - lose the life- <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  cutout ads of Rick all over the  <START:A_Places> place <END> ...pretty tacky.
As soon as I found out I would be traveling to Phoenix, I began looking up  <START:A_Places> places <END>  to eat. Matt's Big  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  was the first thing to crank up my Yelpdar!B R I E F  S U M M A R Y-- Probably the most reviewed/well known  <START:A_Places> place <END>  in downtown Phoenix-- Featured on TV like  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else said--  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  newer  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is a block further than the old (way bigger now!)-- Warm & welcoming  <START:Ambience> ambience <END> --  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and attentive  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  (seems like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a system)-- I recommend coming early, only 6  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  @ 6:45am (Wed morning)--  <START:F_FoodItem> salami scramble <END>  was definitely unique but needed some  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> --  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  had decent  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END> ) but I wish I got hash browns-- Waffle was hot &  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  & syrup was high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> -- Sourdough  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  was thick & good-- Strawberry preserves were delicious!-- The regular  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is very limited--  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  recommends trying the  <START:Offers> specials <END> -- Very sad I couldn't try the french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's ONLY a  <START:Offers> special <END> ! :(Well I woke up super early because I didn't want to get stuck  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and I had a meeting at 8am! I forgot that AZ is an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  ahead of CA. I woke up so tired and barely made  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at 6:45am. I walked from the Westin which was a healthy walk at 6 in the morning! I was a bit disappointed to find the old  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  but luckily I saw the new  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  was only a block further.I really like the feel and  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  of Matt's Big  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  (MBB). The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were all ladies and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and attentive even at 6am! I was barely awake and I wasn't sure if I was going to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again so I ended up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  basically 2  <START:Food> dishes <END>  so I could try 2 things. My  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  loves the waffle so I had to get  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  also recommended but I'm just not a fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  so I opted for the  <START:F_FoodItem> salami scramble <END> . I'm from the San Francisco bay  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  so I'm almost accustomed to what MBB is doing with  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , local  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . I applaud  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  for keeping their  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  so high but I wasn't uberly impressed because I'm sort of used to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I expect to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  a decent amount of money for high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . I didn't feel like MBB was overpriced, I thought the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  were about right in my opinion.The waffle was above average and I could  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the syrup. I really wanted the french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't being offered. To me, if you're famous for french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> , you should offer  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  on your  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ! Nevertheless, the waffle is a good alternative. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salami scramble <END>  was so unique and different. I've never had  <START:Food> anything <END>  quite like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  but I really wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would have added some creamy  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  to smooth out the salami after  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . I think I added some ketchup or hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to my  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  helped balance the salami. If you like salami, I recommend. I probably wouldn't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  again, I just was feeling adventurous. I was a bit surprised that the sourdough  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was so thick but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was still good. The preserves really enabled me to eat all of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  otherwise  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would been just too much  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  for me.Clearly  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is living up to the hype as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is the number 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  in downtown Phoenix. I didn't search further than that because I didn't have a rental car or  <START:Food> anything <END> . I would definitely recommend coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and if I'm ever out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again, I hope that I can grab some of their french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> !
PRO:  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is not very busy for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and you can easily grab a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and a quick  <START:Food> lunch <END>  when other  <START:A_Places> places <END>  nearby are busy. Not a bad  <START:A_Places> place <END>  to eat and have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> .CON: A pretty average  <START:Ambience> spot <END>  with no  <START:Offers> special <END>  flair. Nothing  <START:Offers> special <END> .I have been a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and will go again.
what?!? i had  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for 10pm for my girlfriends birthday ( <START:S_OpenHours> closes <END>  at 11) the host tells me  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  'feel like'  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END>  early, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  won't  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  us. i ask to speak to the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  says  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  won't allow that.. the  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END>  who were leaving when were denied said  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was gross and super greasy anyway
If you choose to eat at what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  used to call, " <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shops <END> " (you know, the 24  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> , huge  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ,  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  all day  <START:A_Places> places <END> ) then  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Bellagio is as nice as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  come. <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's so luxurious sitting in  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Bellagio and peering out into the Conservatory, having the aromas of the  <START:A_Decor> flowers <END>  and being able to see all the seasonal displays.  If you go, ask to sit  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the Conservatory, instead of in the back of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  where all you get to see is Keno screen.The  <START:Service> service <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Bellagio is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> ; I asked specifically for watermelon on my  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  made sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  happened (by having someone run to another  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  to aquire some).  I would recommend  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Bellagio to anyone wanting to enjoy  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  by the Conservatory, or anyone that wants a reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .
We used a  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .com deal to try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  local  <START:Ambience> spot <END>  for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . We were definitely charmed by the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  and  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Places> space <END> , but not so much by the $25 yucky short  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  and $12  <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . The sides (cornbread and creamed  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END> -  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  selections) were decent the  <START:F_FoodItem> empanada <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  had good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  but again all wayyy overpriced. Won't be back.
My husband and I LOVE  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's right down the street from us so  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's super convenient! The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are always nice and super  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is really easy going and the Original Philly Cheesesteak sandwhichs are AWESOME!!!!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the only thing I ever  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  because why mess with the best?  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are very reasonable. Just wish the shopping center  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in was easier to access. And I wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END> ! ;)
We visited  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on a Saturday afternoon and we didn't have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was pretty nice at first. My husband and I  <START:S_Staff> each <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  one of their  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  with a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were very greasy and mushy.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were not appetizing at all. I left most of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  on my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  honestly looked like something I could have made at home and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  any better. As we were eating, we noticed the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  began to get a little more crowded. That was when the  <START:Service> service <END>  from our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  got bad.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  never came back to refill our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or ask if we needed  <START:Food> anything <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  simply came by to give us our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was like  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was rushing us out. Very rude. I will not be going back, the  <START:Food> food <END>  really sucked and the  <START:Service> service <END>  really sucked.
How could one not be a fan of Carnevino?!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's amazing! The  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent, and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were flowing. If you find yourself in Vegas craving a really good piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , and have an overflowing wallet,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  to go! While the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  were a little high for my  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> , our traveling buddies wanted to take us  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . We definitely enjoyed our  <START:Food> meal <END> , by far  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was amazing. I sampled things I hadn't before, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was all around enjoyable. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent, many different  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  stopped by our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  for different things, and  <START:S_Staff> each <END>  was extremely professional and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . I absolutely loved the  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  side  <START:Food> dish <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was by far my favorite. I also LOVED the  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  (who woulda thunk?), that was amazing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> , if you have the budget to spend.
We ate  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Sienna on Sunday night and, yet again, found a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  to eat in Uptown Charlotte. We were surprised to have the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  almost all to ourselves, but then again,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a Sunday night and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was rainy. We loved the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  - from the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  I can see how  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might be mistaken for a high  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  snooty  <START:A_Places> place <END> , as a previous reviewer pointed out, and just like him, we were mistaken -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was laid back and affordable! We were very happy with the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , which offers a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of antipasti,  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and  <START:Food> entrees <END> , which range from  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , veal,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> . We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the portabello for an app, along with the mussels. The mussels were the largest I have ever seen! (see pic). And  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were delicious. The portabello was very good and my only complaint  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't enough of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  between my fiancee and I. One thing I wasn't too happy with: the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  bring you when you sit down.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , like  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ! Not even toasted or  <START:Food> anything <END> , just a few pieces from a  <START:F_FoodItem> loaf <END>  you buy at your local  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery   store   <END> . Maybe  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a Sunday, but we thought that was pretty weird. But once we  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  we didn't even notice the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  anymore anyway. The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was excellent,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was brought to us on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  knew the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and made  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Service> recommendations <END> . For my  <START:Food> entree <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  with pesto over angel hair  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  alone is a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just enough, not too thick to make you feel sick after, just the perfect blend of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , pesto,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  - amazing! My fiancee  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the filet mignon with the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  over  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was happy with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , although  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  did say the filet was pretty mediocre, and then if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't have the crabmeat on top  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wouldn't have been  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Offers> special <END> . But regardless, both  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were very good and we both agreed we will totally be going back!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's on our list of  <START:A_Places> places <END>  to take family members when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  visit.
Five  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  makes the best  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  I have ever had in my life, period.
We met another couple  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  last week and had a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  We've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  before and were again, pleased.  The happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  are very good.  The indoor/ <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  &  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  is roomy and nice.  The  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  we've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> , (sorry, I forgot his name........a tall man) is always so  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .  Check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out, you won't be disappointed!
Decided to try  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . For a fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is very overpriced.The  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was dripping with  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> , and was otherwise fairly  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curds <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , but the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are merely average. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was decent at least.
 <START:Service> service <END>  - 4Atmosphere - 4Food - 6Vegetarian  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  - 7General Awesomeness - 5We had a party of about 10 for brunch on a Sunday morning, and had an incredibly difficult  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  receiving the most basic  <START:Service> service <END> .  Getting a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  took 4 requests and about 20 min, the rest of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  followed a similar path.
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> !! I could eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  almost every day.  <START:Service> service <END>  is always  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  with little  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .
Discovered Siena Bistro last spring.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's been a favorite for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  ever since.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's lovely to sit  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and enjoy the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  and peacefulness.The frittata and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  carbonara are  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  has always been attentive.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's really a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  value.
Awesome to find out that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a regular open mic/live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  schedule
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is, hands down, the absolute best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  (not counting the fancy shmancy or seaside  <START:A_Places> places <END> ).  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a bit hidden because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  inside a higher end  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery   store   <END>  (that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also own), but once you find  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's like a hidden gem that you either want to keep for yourself or  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  off to the whole world. I kid you not, I make the trip down to Montréal whenever I can, just to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  are such good people, and their  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  characters  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  through the carefully prepared  <START:Food> dishes <END> , which by the way are also presented in generous proportions.
I've only ever had take-out from  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and I've always enjoyed the  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chinese <END> -Canadian  <START:Food> food <END> , and I've never been disappointed in a  <START:Food> dish <END> . The Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  really does set  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  apart though. You have to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .My  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  have always been filled quickly, and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is pleasant.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Ambience> spot <END>  was my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  in the West Valley.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . Most of my out of  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  guests even my pickiest of friends loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The only complaint is that sometimes the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are overwhelmed on the weekends and I don't get refills on my  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  on those days.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need to hire more  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  for the busy weekends... <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is always packed with customers. I will eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  everytime I come back to  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  even without the refills on  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  the Las Vegas  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  is awesome !
I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , mostly because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to my house but I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is a little loud but if you are into 85 TV's displaying 40 different  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>  programs  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all good.  What brings me back ... their mojito's ... love 'em.
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is good.  I had the queso with bits of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was good.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was something you could grab at other decent Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is not necessarily the problem with  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> . <START:Restaurant> this <END> ...my friends....is another tourist trap.  The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are in the stratosphere for the  <START:Food> food <END>  you get.  The  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is smack dab in the middle of the pyramid.  Imagine  <START:Restaurant> this <END> :  You are eating a  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  and enjoying your  <START:Food> meal <END>  when you look up and see an ad for the Bodies Exhibit...with the dude's guts all hanging out.  Pretty bad right?  Now imagine you see the Bodies Exhibit ad and so you turn around to see....gasp....an ad for the  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>  Top  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> ....with his ugly mug staring right back at you.I lost my  <START:F_Appetizer> appetite <END>  after seeing  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>  Top, and I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  a fortune for ok mexican  <START:Food> food <END> .  That is what is wrong with  <START:Restaurant>   this place <END>  .
The  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  is different everyday. The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  said Saturdays and Sundays are the best days to come. You can also check the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of the day in fb.
I used to love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  but now the  <START:Service> service <END>  has gone downhill,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  got rid of their good iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and substituted  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with some chemical-taating off brand, their  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  have gone WAY UP.  $9.75 for a sald with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in a stripmall joint is way too much, the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was rude and the greek  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  is sooooooo loud.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  added the suite next  <START:Restaurant> store <END>  to their dinig  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> , so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  raised all their  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  by 2 or 3 dollars  <START:S_Staff> each <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  to compensate.  I liked  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  a lot better when  <START:Restaurant> thy <END>  were smaller, friendlier and didnt cut corners on the  <START:Food> food <END> .  Sadly  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will be or last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
Based on décor alone, Boca 7 would get four  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for all  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> -out-of- <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  glam in Mesa.  The design work by the dentist/co- <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  is totally over the top.  The devil is in the details and a few of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  need tweaking.  The heights of the black crystal chandeliers and huge red fabric spheres need to be varied to make the  <START:Ambience> ceiling <END>  look less cluttered.   <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is also in desperate need of a dimmer switch.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is tradition that Asian  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  be  <START:A_Decor> lit <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're in the middle of a raid to emphasize that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are clean, but all those chandeliers blazing on high are too much at Boca 7.  The screw heads used to affix the huge Asian symbols to the back  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  also need to be hidden.  And what's with putting the cheapest paper  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  on the market on the granite  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ?  When you've spent  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  much money on the  <START:A_Decor> interior <END> , either get a nice paper  <START:S_Cutlery> napkin <END>  or splash out for cloth  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> .  Unfortunately, the  <START:Food> food <END>  does not live up to the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> .  Compared to a Vietnamese gem like Cyclo, the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is a bit of a disappointment.   <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's nothing wrong with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:Food> food <END>  I would expect to find in a very  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  Vietnamese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  However,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:A_Environment> setting <END>  makes me expect something much more modern.  Perhaps the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  should look to Jin Ju in Chicago as a template to follow as I think that  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is much closer to the concept of mod Asian fare in a hip  <START:A_Environment> setting <END>  that would work for  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> .  Now whether or not that concept will actually work in Mesa is another question altogether.   The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is a hoot.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's filled with advertising and reads like a gay who's who of Phoenix dentists and bankruptcy lawyers.   <START:Restaurant>   this place <END>   is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  a visit just to check out the décor.  If Liberace had been Vietnamese,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  could have been his  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .
I love their pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  the most.
thanks to Groupon's $6 for $12 coupon I probably wouldn't know about  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> . My first expeirence with New Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  so didn't know what to expect. Similar  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  as your typical Mexican restuarant and a few of their own. Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  Carlito's  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  (pic) which i really liked for $7.60 with all of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's 8 complimentary add-ons,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , and so on.  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and sour cream was extra.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was loaded with  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  chunks of  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , i could definitely  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  a difference in the  <START:F_Ingredients> spices <END>  and seasoning.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also have a  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  for $4.60 that you can mixup all kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  together, or the combo  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  for around $6-7 which is the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .Total wasn't $12 yet so I added the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>    <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  for also $7.60.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  weren't that bad, had a bunch of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  that resembled those layered  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  dips what I usually eat while watching football.  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> guacomole <END> , and sour cream and some large  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  pieces. didn't care for their  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> , shaped and seasoned like doritos, and got soggy quickly. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a good nightly  <START:Offers> special <END>  from 4-9pm.Mondays - Santa Fe Sliders for $1Tuesdays - <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  for $1Wednesday - HUMP DAY - 1/2 off  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  till 11 am and $6  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> .Thurdays - Bottomless bowls green chile shew for $6.50.Friday -  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  fajitas from $6-8.Saturaday - Ribs for $8.95Sunday - 2 for 1  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  all day. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END> , and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  so that's cool. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were busy during  <START:Food> lunch <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and a few  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  counters to eat at. also like all of their  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END>  and their open  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .
Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END>  1/31/12.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had the unlimited  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  tail for $70  <START:Offers> special <END> . Really liked their  <START:S_Menu> selection <END> . Nice  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimps <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs were already  <START:S_OpenHours> opened <END>  for easy eating. Good overall.
If you are in some serious craving for some gourmet  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! You have to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  a little, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> !You get a  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  of their pre-made  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  or you can just CUSTOMIZE  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !  You get to choose a huge array of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and other nice sautéed  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> .  What makes their  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  extra good is the  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> patty <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  is sooo soft and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END>  while the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is so perfectly made.After the first  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> , I just kept eating away.  I never finished a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  so fast. Hehehehe! =)
The  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  of Fugu is a huge bonus. Being  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  on State St right on campus,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's definitely popular amongst students especially.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  good Sze Chuan  <START:Food> food <END> , which means that the majority of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  will be  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  with spicy oil -- making  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  spicy. Their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  actually runs pretty parallel to that of Ichiban. I have written a review of that pretty recently and I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and recommend the same favorites as I do at Ichiban. Plus,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are many reviews of Fugu out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with good  <START:Service> recommendations <END>  on what to get, so I will talk more about the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Went to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  once for my post-seminar celebration with my group. We had the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> , which was a good deal coming to about $10.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has a set consisting of the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  course, a  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END>  to go with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Most of their sets are  <START:Service> served <END>  in bento boxes, which is a pretty cool concept. For  <START:Food> dinner <END>  you just  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  off their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . <START:Service> service <END>  wise,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a little off what I could call top-notch. Which means that your  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  course  <START:Food> dishes <END>  might come before or together with your  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . On some occasion especially when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are busy, you might have to remind  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  about parts of your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . But  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are pretty good about reminders, and will get you what you want fast. I would visit more often but Ichiban has equally good Sze Chuan delicacies with a much larger sitting  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  and ample  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> . Between one or the other  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boils <END>  down to personal preference and convenience. If I live downtown and I do not have a car, Fugu will be the logical option. Otherwise, take your pick, either way you will get nice Sze Chuan  <START:Food> dishes <END>  =)
Wow, I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  today without checking reviews. Thank god I didn't because I would have missed out on a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . Maybe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are better when  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  slow. Anyways,  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's my take: <START:Service> service <END>  - Very good, our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  checked up on us twice, brought  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  all within 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  was hot,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were cold, 9.5/10 because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very slow so no excuses. <START:Food> food <END> / <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> : Once again very good. I had the quesadilla cancun and the filling was as hot as a fajita when I dug in.  <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END>  were also decent, not as strong as I like but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was only 4pm so  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's ok. My only complaint was the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  were a tad cold. Otherwise 9/10. <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was $40 for two  <START:Food> meals <END>  and two  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  including tip, for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a decent  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> . Could have had a larger  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of sides, so Id give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a 8/10. <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  - Very  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  at 4pm, Im sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  picks up after 6. Very colorful  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and pretty cool carved tabletops and  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END> , although a little cramped in the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a nice looking mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . 8/10.Overall - 34.5/40 - Thank god the reviews below are no longer the case,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a very good  <START:Food> meal <END>  and I will be back. Maybe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a change of  <START:S_Staff> management <END> ? I would reccommend  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> .
Never seen so many kids work so hard at a fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  was crazy and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are getting  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  in and out.  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  job  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> 
i know  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  a fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but normally the  <START:Food> food <END>  is pretty decent but when i went to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  one,  <START:Service> service <END>  was very slow and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was so so. I do not think i will be coming back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.
I'm not a fan of Golden Corral, but since my parents got coupons we went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for brunch. All Golden Corrals are pretty cheap considering the amount of  <START:Food> food <END>  you can actually eat. The  <START:Food> food <END>  wasn't bad,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and since we went 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  was over we got to get the chance of getting free  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_Drinks> juice <END> .I walked in and saw a  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:A_Decor> fountain <END> , which I don't think I've seen in any other Golden Corrals before. I grew up going to these  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , so as default I got sick of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and never come.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  Golden Corral was pretty new, right to the new  <START:S_OpenHours> opened <END>  Walmart,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in the right  <START:A_Places> place <END>  for business.The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and helped with any  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and picking up  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> cooks <END>  were also helpful if you wanted something from the grill. Bathrooms were pretty clean, so if you need a break and need to drop some weight to eat more, you're welcome to do  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ! Haha.Very diverse  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  which makes Golden Corral feel more homey and you could get a nice look of the diversity in Charlotte. Anyways, I'll come back if my parents have the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  isn't bad, especially if you're hungry for  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  or any of their many selections.
Eating at Benedict's made me feel like having brunch at my favorite aunt's house. The  <START:A_Places> place <END>  was homey, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was warm and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was comforting. The  <START:A_Places> place <END>  was small and only had a few small  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were some  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  that offered  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  for larger groups. I can easily understand if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would take a while to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  on a busy day. Good thing (or unfortunately) we got to Benedict's a little past  <START:Food> lunch <END>  already. We immediately got a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and we were greeted as soon as we went through the door. I don't think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a lot of  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> . Take note of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  when you visit  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's busy. I would think  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  would scramble to make sure  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is helped and taken cared of. As I've written, the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  felt like home, even my own mom or aunt would have a hard  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  managing several guest at one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>  was hands-on. The lady who  <START:Service> served <END>  us during our visit was very warm.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was engaging and very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . Again, like what I wrote,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was just like my favorite aunt. I did have some concerns, else I would have  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  with 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  3  <START:Food> items <END>  from their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  that were not available. Thus, why coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  late might be a disadvantage.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ran out of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> , challah  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  for the french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  and avocado for the California  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict. Would have been nice to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out. Maybe i'll come in early the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  so I get to try what I want.The  <START:Food> food <END>  that were  <START:Service> served <END>  to us was very good. Let me correct that,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very good.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was better than other big  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  brunch  <START:A_Places> places <END>  that I have visited.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was original and full of  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . We had the Arizona  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  benedict and their  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  croissant  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . The croissant  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was soft, airy and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The additional kick on the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was the pesto  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  nicely and the  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> , though not as crispy as I wanted had a good  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  as well. My wife loved the Arizona  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  benedict.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had tomatillo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  instead of the usual hollandaise  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was also a hint of  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  tortilla  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  on the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that gave the  <START:Food> dish <END>  a mexican finish.  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were poached perfectly and the runny  <START:F_FoodItem> yolk <END>  complimented the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  wasn't bad as well. Not too salty and but had enough kick at the end to tell you that you are eating a  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> .  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END>  were also very good. Add the warm  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  with good, Benedict's  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  just felt like home.more reviews at http://themealexperience.blogspot.com/
Thin, square (that's their gimmick 'our  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is in a square shape') dry  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> -resteraunt  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  that's forgettable.  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  also uninspired.
Last night I had one of the best  <START:Food> meals <END>  of my life. I found out that Bistro La Bon,  a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been wanting to try forever, has a 10 course tasting every Thursday. For $35pp you get 10 amazing courses, bigger  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  than I thought too. The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  is so creative and I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is his play  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  puts together  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  you wouldn't think to but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  turn out amazing.I know the first two and last two  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> , but I'm a little uncertain on the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in between.1. Watermelon gazpacho that was unexpectedly (and delightfully) a little spicy2.  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  buffalo mozzarella with heirloom  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> , micro  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> , and 12 yr balsamic3. Goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  stuffed peppadew  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  with carmalized  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  and a  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>  honey  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was a favorite4. Seared  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>  over mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  with demi glaze- dining partner said  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> .5. Crispy avocado and  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  with sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> - another favorite6.  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> - don't remember much about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I don't like seafood7. Sweedish  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  with ligonberry8. Some kind of cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  whipped cream with ouzi?  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> - really good and very different9. The most amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  with a brie type  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and apricot marmalade that went perfect together10.  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  flourless  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  with mango sorbetThe  <START:Food> food <END>  was just to die for, but also the anticipation of what was coming next was really exciting. I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's different every week.
I have visit alot of mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  especially in US in N.Y and SF. im very picky when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  comes to  <START:Food> food <END> , because i only want to have the best. <START:A_Decor> decor <END> : very nice, both  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  and exteriorStaff: attentive, but without any smileFood: now the most important of a mexican concept,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was ok,  <START:F_FoodItem> nacho <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  was very good, Faijtas was also ok. The Guacalole was not good,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was really bad actually.The marguritas was very good.Probably one of the better mexican  <START:A_Places> places <END>  in Edinburgh.
My wife loves  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  regardless of where we are, but I just don't have that same love for Chipotle as  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  does. LOL - Well,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was one down the street from where we were staying last week, so we stopped by for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Their  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very enthusiastic as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  greet you with a huge hello, how are ya as soon as you enter the business.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is, of course, the same as all the others, but the black  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  just  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  better than usual, for some reason. I just got the bowl with barbacoa to keep  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  safe because I've been known as a bit of a "Tortilla Snob"...haha, but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  was very, very good. I was absolutely impressed with the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and will definitely go back the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we're in  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  visiting our daughter!#KudosOnTheEnthusiasm
I like Centurion.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's got more  <START:A_Places> space <END>  now after their expansion, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a quirky, unusual  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  You feel really  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END> , and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is always good. <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's terrific that after 5pm weekday and all day Saturday and Sunday, street  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is completely free (so no need to add coins).  Trust me, I live downtown.Their 7 course tasting  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is unbelievably  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  ($50 for  <START:Food> food <END>  only, $75 with  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  pairings).  The 21% gratuity  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  automatically add though is highly annoying (15% is fine, 18% okay, but 21% is a mugging). <START:Service> service <END>  is good.  Their  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  of the day is unbelievable ($8).   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  make the best  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  in all of Phoenix, in my opinion, and are creativeTheir  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are good too, but maybe a dollar or two too  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END> .Their mussels are also a standout and fairly  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> .Personally, I'd stick with the three above for an everyday  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and the tasting  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for a  <START:Offers> special <END>  occasion like an anniversary. Their brunch is also fun.
Disappointment on a tiny  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . I'm giving TPF 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  because the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is exceptionally beautiful,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had live Spanish guitar and a flamenco  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> dancer <END>  when I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and the Sangria is fabulous. The  <START:Food> food <END>  on the other hand , blah. From someone who  <START:S_Staff> cooks <END>  and considers eating a  <START:A_Entertainment> sport <END> , I could totally  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  that many of the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  had been bought pre made and frozen. I'll give a little run down on what we had. <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> - were frozen, par baked like you buy at the  <START:A_LocatedArea> grocery   store   <END>  for Thanksgiving  <START:Food> dinner <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did come with the most amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  dip.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  called  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  aioli , <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't even  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to an aioli, but delicious all the same.   Almondigas con Tomate - essentially frozen  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  balls sitting in canned spaghetti  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .Tortilla de Patatas -  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  used to make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  - frozen  Pisto gratinado~  <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END>  in Iberico béchamel  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  covered in puff  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END>  - 2nd best  <START:Food> dish <END>  we had. The highlight of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was an open faced  <START:F_FoodItem> empanada <END>  with roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . I don't see  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  on the online  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to get the actual name but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was gooey, garlicy,goat cheesy and I could have eaten 3 of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> . Cava Sangria -  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , tart and a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  deal. The Sangria on  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  own is $8 a glass but by the pitcher  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is only $36. We got 6 full glasses out of the pitcher so you can do the math on the value. We had a few other things but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  weren't  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  mentioning. I'm also not going to go to detailed into the  <START:Service> service <END>  because the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  was packed and had several large parties of self entitled Scottsdaleites blocking the aisles and demanding much more attention than was necessary but I will say  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was about 30 mins before we got our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  before we got our 1st  <START:Food> dish <END> . The rest came about 25 mins after that. The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was apologetic and we understood that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was more the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  and clientele than  <START:Food> anything <END>  else. I wouldn't go back for the  <START:Food> food <END>  but I would for the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  and the Sangria.
Corner  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is a decent  <START:A_Places> place <END>  to grab a decent  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , and the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are pretty good as well, although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are other Pizzerias in the city that do give better value for money. However, if you live local, then  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:A_Places> place <END>  to go to. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  does not do deliveries, but if you call  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  up you can pre- <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  so that is ready when you get  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .When I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 12" pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was £6, which is pretty good, although the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was more greasy than normal and I used a tissue to absorb areas of excess  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> .The  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  were also pretty  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>  so I decided to go to a local off-license to get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  instead. Corner  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  also do other  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  as well, such as kebabs,  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and a range of Ben and Jerry  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  creams.
I was tired my child was tired, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  on the phone to expedite the  <START:Food> meal <END>  to bring home, My child ate at Wendy's right around the corner, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my 40 dollars  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> , gave my name and phone number. I said can you have  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ready at 8pm.  ¨no problem¨  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said.  ha ha ha I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  like a dope til 8pm because my kid ate and we were done by 7:35. I walked in at 8pm and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said ¨my name¨ I was thinking wow !   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said okay ¨We make  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  now" OMG  I would give  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  zero  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  but I can't. I still want to try one thing on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  i never tried anywhere else sounds good, but I refuse.  I never see anyone in the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  I pass  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  daily. laundering money? hm
We meet  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  every Wednesday and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's always awesome. Megan is a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  and I love the Big Daddy  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> !
Hooray! We finally made  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt as though we were in Downtown Phoenix again due to the hip and locally owned feel. I wish  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  could be SO many more  <START:A_Places> places <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  in the  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> .The  <START:A_LocatedArea> building <END>  is small and charming. You can certainly tell a lot of love and effort were put into making  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  a success.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END> ,  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Have  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> 's,  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> 's,  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and hard  <START:F_Drinks> liquor <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's small inside with about 6  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  around  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  as well. Cute  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  with umbrellas  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> .Multiple  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  options available! I had the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END> -Tarian  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . Seems like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have varied  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  options and  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  that change from day to day. The  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . 32 has done amazingly with a concept that is very difficult for  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ... To excel at ALL 3  <START:Food> meals <END> , keep up  <START:S_Menu> variety <END> , have a spectacular  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , innovative  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and now have a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  as well.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is even a drive through  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> ! I felt right at home and cannot  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to come back for some  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . The  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list looked extensive and varied. Keep supporting local and get  <START:Restaurant> here <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's amazing. I kind of want to live in a little loft above  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> . We try and go every other week. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is a little slow but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . I have been to several Thai  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  from NYC to CA and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  one is in my top 3 for sure!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a brand new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> . I was excited to see that  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's now open. The  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  has a cool bistro  <START:A_Decor> theme <END> . I sat on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  with my bike because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no  <START:S_Parking> bike rack <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a lack of bike racks at the Arizona Center, in general. But back to the  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good. I had trouble deciding what to try. I had a  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ok, but next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I would try an actual  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> . My friend said the  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  was really good.  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are medium ranged. Similar to those of Paradise Bakery, one of their competitors I would assume. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .
I love  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's right next to my house! I brought so many friends and family over  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  to go almost every week! Stuff is always nice and happy to see you:) I recommend to check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's good for 2 or big party!!!!
 <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  is mind-blowing. Awesome home- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  style Brazilian  <START:Food> food <END>  at an affordable  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> . Perfectly grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  vegetarian options, and savory smoothies (try the mango!) Don't get discouraged by the long cooking  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  - the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> / <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  is making  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  a la  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  in the back.  <START:Restaurant>   this place <END>   is simply glorious. To add even more to the proverbial pie, the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  gave us bowls of what I can only describe as the best lentil  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  I've ever had, on the house, because of the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a gem that should not be ignored!
Awful awful  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> ! An insult to  <START:F_Ingredients> chinese <END> /asian  <START:Food> cuisine <END> ! Seriously! I figured, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was featured in the  <START:F_Ingredients> chinese <END>  newspaper,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  must somehow represent what we eat... but no... Not one  <START:Food> dish <END>  was acceptable.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a thailand style  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which in my opinion should be made with something along mango,  <START:F_Ingredients> papaya <END> , sweet and spicy... but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was chop suey with  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and tiny bit of  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> ! the  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was all breading, goey sticky starchy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ,  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> , too sweet.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  available even though  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is one of their most marketed  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> item <END> . And the  <START:Service> service <END>  was beyond bad. Even though  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a all you can eat, after  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seem to try to ignore you as much as possible as soon as you try to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  something else. We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a second round, abandonned and asked for the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . Surprisingly, the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came in fast enough.  I really do not recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  at all.
I just can't say I was that impressed. Nice big  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  and decent  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  took a really long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to come out and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just wasn't that  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> .
Outstanding!  Wonderful  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END> , and  <START:Service> service <END> !  My husband and I frequently  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  and enjoy trying local  <START:A_Places> places <END>  and we are so pleased that we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  and when we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was honest and told us we could  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  and relax a little so the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  could catch up!  We went for a relaxing evening and that definitely started  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  -  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  offered  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  input for various  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  based on what we said we like.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was top notch -  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to perfection, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  gidori was delicious.  We shared an upside down  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pistachio <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> -cream, yummy.  All courses were  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  was very reasonable for the  <START:Food> food <END>  we received.  The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  was cozy and sophisticated.  We highly recommend trying  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  - we will go back !
Worst  <START:Service> service <END>  ever.The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  is NOT  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , okay some  <START:A_Places> places <END>  aren't  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  but AT LEAST  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  GOOD. LOTS AND LOTS OF  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  in their  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> .The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  don't want to be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and don't know how to handle large groups.Overall, I would never return.
Unbelievably delicious  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The value  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  little gem offers is fantastic- Thai  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  to the delicious  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .We came during the week and had outstanding  <START:Service> service <END>  and a terrific  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>  kicked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  off and we had a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  all the way through to the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye finish! And if the  <START:Food> meal <END>  itself was not even enough don't leave with out a pot of  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and a Thai  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END> ! Don't be scared the hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  makes  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  Give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a shot you are gonna love  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !
Very unethical and no integrity.  Went in with a comp.  Asked  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  accept  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  told me yes and i  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and ate.   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  told me the computer will not accept  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  dont accept the comps anymore.  Got  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said same thing.  I told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  why should i  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for your  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  mistake?   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said sorry, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  cant do  <START:Food> anything <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  cant discount my  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> .  Nice.  What that tells me is if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  make a mistake i will  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  If the  <START:Food> food <END>  is cold, if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  takes an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> , if  <START:F_FoodItem> its <END>  burnt... you will still  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  or  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  When you have so many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  (and aria as well), why go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ?
I am angry  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  drove out Teakwoods...  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a convenient  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>   <START:Ambience> spot <END> , so my husband and I were hoping at least a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  new  <START:A_Places> place <END>  drove away our favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  No.  The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  were too lazy to change the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was dark and weird and confused.  The  <START:A_Places> space <END>  is underutilized, the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had no direction, and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was awful.  The entire  <START:A_Places> place <END>  lacks both concept and execution. We will not be returning, and are sad to have lost  a  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  gem.
I wish I could  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  higher. Along with most of you, I love supporting local  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  and businesses - especially if  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  joint. However, while the  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, nothing about my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  really stood out. Walking in, my friend and I were the only ones in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , except for one person  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  at the counter about to leave. I wasn't sure whether the lack of customers was because the  <START:Food> food <END>  was bad or simply because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was late morning on a Thursday. I ended up getting the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  sliders, due to many good reviews of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on yelp. Yes the  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , and yes  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were good. But overall, the  <START:Food> dish <END>  was just meh. My  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  was super oily and the  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  were underseasoned. As for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ? Super burnt, which is usually a huge indicator that  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just been sitting on the warmer for quite some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was completely and utterly undrinkable. Sad to say, I probably wouldn't recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Ambience> spot <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  my friends and I are trying to find somewhere to eat. But, if any of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  want to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I wouldn't be opposed to giving  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a second chance.
If you like  <START:Food> food <END>  that's been dropped on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  to you anyways then  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:A_Places> place <END>  to go otherwise the  <START:Food> food <END>  is really good.
Confession  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Authentic Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_Places> places <END>  intimidate me. I am very interested in trying out new things but rarely do because of the language barrier. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  at  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  are the nicest most helpful  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  I have ever had at an 'over the counter'  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . My first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  took the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to explain the entire  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and let me sample all the different  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I settled on soyrizo.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent. As a confused white  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  I think of  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  as a chipotle style  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  with real Mexican  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> . I make a point to stop by and try something new whenever I am on the east side.
Came to Carmines for a business  <START:Food> dinner <END> . We had a large group and the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  was really  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  about changing our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  as our party  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  increased. We sat near the back and could watch as the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  brought out the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  for other  <START:Food> diners <END>  and man just like the reveiws say -  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are huge! I've been to other family style  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  (bucca or maggianos) and I think Carmines is way better than both of those. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Carmines  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and anti  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  to start. Then our  <START:F_FoodItem> mains <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  in red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , veal parm, and broccoli and  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  rigatoni in white  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all really  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> - i especially liked the veal parm. For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we had the titanic and choc  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> . All in all a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  - had  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  flowing and good fun.  I do have to mention  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  that sings  <START:Food> italian <END>  opera -- AMAZING.   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was singing happy birthday to a few folks and came over and sang our group a different song.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was super nice and  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's really good! Go see him for yourself!!!
Absolutely fantastic!  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , unique and tons of  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> ...kids loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  too. Definitely making  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a regular stop.
Very quiet over  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> . Was exactly what I was looking for too. However I hope  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  aren't relying on their  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  for business, because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's lacking. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> . $8.10 for  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  and brown  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . Ladies working were super nice and I enjoyed their company while sitting at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . I'll be back. Super spicy just the way I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !!!
Good  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ;  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  marinate cheaper, tougher cuts of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  & make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  good by charcoal grilling. The side of  <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END>  was excellent. We enjoyed the skirt and hanger  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> . The Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was good but  the  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  did not  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  in  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was the ditziest I have ever experienced..every 3rd word was yummie..gr8 English vocabulary  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had, dah..poor vegas education or just an absolute ditz. When we asked about the sides..well,  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  comment was  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are all so awesome & yummie with no description of any. We finally got  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  as we finished our  <START:Food> entrees <END> . The Tuscan  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was the saltiest I have ever had..absolutely inedible.  We will  return for the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  & sides.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are quite disorganized with so many  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  that are poorly trained or just poorly educated young kids. Poor on the  <START:Service> service <END>  side. Definitely not even  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to T Bones in Red Rock. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  in the butcher  <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  are off the chart  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>  &  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  raise the per lb  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  almost every day. No way is a lousy tough NY strip  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  $27./lb.  The whole carcusses are hanging in their  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  as are 2 whole headless pigs and their heads are on the top shelf. That is enough to turn anybody off. Very attractive  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  but extremely loud with marble-like hard  <START:A_Places> floors <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is on the 2nd  <START:A_Places> floor <END> . Nice  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>  dining if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is not too hot outdoors.
Relatively new local joint  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to home.  Nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  on the inside!  Very clean.   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was good, but not  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END> .  Now on to the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .  B and G  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  Carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were ok.   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was good.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  a good  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of local micro brews.  Need to come back for some 'shine and copper mule!  Nice  <START:A_Places> place <END> ,  we will be back.
Finally got  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> , heard about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  from my friends many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> ! The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is good,  <START:A_Environment> environment <END>  is not bad, doesn't feel like those typical Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , I definitely will come back again!! Had a  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> !! Love  <START:Restaurant> it <END> ..!!!
I ate  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last night.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was better than when we tried to go when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  first  <START:S_OpenHours> opened <END>  - too crowded, not enough  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so so. The  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  was just  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and some  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> , nothing to write home about. Will go again try something different, to get my final opinion of  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END> 
Today was my fourth visit and probably my last visit. I was extremely happy the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  because I'm from Chicago and grew up on Al's on (Taylor). Anyway, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was delicious. I think I even wrote a good review the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . However the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went I was disappointed the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was luke warm and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were kinda salty but still had  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . Third visit went the same way, so I thought to myself maybe I'm going to often and my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  buds are getting use to the  <START:Food> food <END> . Well today I went after about 2 months and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the same type of  <START:Food> food <END>  but worse. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was cold, the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  well I'll just say I had  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  with my  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ridiculous. I got upset because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's pretty pricey. I don't want to ruin what I grew up on so I'll  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go to a Chicago to have Al's on Taylor. I gave  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  because the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is always nice, the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  remembered me big plus because I love  <START:F_FI_Quality> great <END>  customer  <START:Service> service <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is always clean and the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was good. I suggest getting a different warmer for the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and tell your  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  easy with the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .
I stopped in for a  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  and was favorably impressed by the  <START:A_Places> place <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a nice, clean, well- <START:A_Decor> lit <END>  dining  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> .  The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for  <START:Service> service <END> .  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the half  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and cornbread.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was a nice combination of  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  greens.  The cornbread was a huge chunk that could easily have been shared among 4  <START:Food> diners <END> .  The reason I'm giving  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  only a 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rating is that the chunky pot roast  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was too salty for me.  When my  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  checked back with me I told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  about the  <START:F_FI_Taste> saltiness <END> .   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  apologized and offered to bring a bowl of their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  instead.  That was too salty for me as well.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  may be that I'm just too sensitive to  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .  Whatever,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very accommodating and asked what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  could offer instead.  Since I'd pigged out on all that  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and the yummy  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , I was no longer hungry.  So  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  took the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  of the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  off my  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> .  I don't consider my personal sensitivity to  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  to be any fault of my  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .  Accordingly, I added the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  of the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  to  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  tip.  I was a satisfied customer when I left, and I'll definitely be back to try something from their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
So bomb the dim sum option is on point like seriously. Recommend  <START:Restaurant>   this     place   <END>  for those craving Asian  <START:Food> food <END>  on a budget. I will definitely come back for sure ;)
The pan fried dumplings and a  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  boba  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  were my Christmas  <START:Food> dinner <END> . I wish I had chosen more wisely. We came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  after wandering the strip because I was cold and starving and just couldn't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  any longer for  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't bad.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was actually pretty good.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just way more  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>  than  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Worthiness> worth <END> . My  <START:Food> meal <END>  was $22 which is ridiculous for those two  <START:Food> items <END> . I got 6 dumplings. For that, I should have gotten more dumplings or 6 with more exotic  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  than just  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . $13 is appropriate for 6 dumplings if  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're made of ostrich or Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . The three  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  are because my boyfriend had an amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ...a little more  <START:F_FI_Price> expensive <END>  than the  <START:Food> food <END>  truck ($8) but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ok because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's something I can't recreate by myself, decent  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  and you can't get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just anywhere. I don't know specifically which one  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was absolutely delicious. 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for fukuburger just by itself. The dumplings weren't bad but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  weren't outstanding either. Just average. I encourage you to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  if you're curious about FAME, but I'll never come back for  <START:Food> anything <END>  else.
A bit overpriced, but for being part of the new downtown summerlin, I can see how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  want to cater for a certain  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> .Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for an office  <START:Food> lunch <END> , we made  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  for 10. Even though we had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  and made  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , we still had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  20mins. Not too bad, but you would think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  ready for a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  beforehand. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was OK, I had better. I feel  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was somewhat plain with the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  only  <START:A_Entertainment> showing <END>  the 'standard'  <START:Offers> specials <END> . Like spicy crunch  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> ...etc. nothing too fancy that can be seen as signature. As for the  <START:Food> entrees <END> , we had a bunch of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> , standard BLT,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , etc. the the Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was the most fancy one. I personally had the sautéed Norwegian  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was tender, flavorful, but not dry. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was creamy and perfectly paired with the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> . I recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  100%. For  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  alone, I would come back, my husband likes classic  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  so  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  is good with that.The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is nice, very modern, suiting the overall  <START:A_Environment> setting <END>  of the mall. Only visited during  <START:Food> lunch <END> , so we'll see how  <START:Food> dinner <END>  will be. Perhaps I'll update the review when we have done so with my  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , didn't know the  <START:Offers> specials <END> , again, went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  opening week, so I'm sure  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was new.

Excelnte  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  right across from Lincoln Center if you did not get tickets to the opera from  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  you can listen, magnificent  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  is also very good,  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  excellent reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , on 2 occasions I have been always see more locals tourists and this always speaks highly of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , also is seen to be  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  of very good standard.  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  pie is the best I've had in PA and the  <START:F_FoodItem> lasagna <END>  is great, sensational  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  .
I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  Superbowl Sunday last year, and actually saw one of my middle-aged professors getting cozy with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  hubby (awwwkwarrrrd).  But I guess  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  just goes to  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  frequent Esquire.  In general, the crowd is older, and  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  seem to be regulars.  The  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  seem to know  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  by name....  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  reminds me a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  Cheers.Free  <START:F_FoodItem> peanuts <END>  (learning to just drop the shells on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  was the hardest part for me...  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just feels so unnatural!), cheap  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , lots of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END> 's  <START:A_Environment> everywhere <END> , and lots of  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  and/or  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .I wouldn't necessary come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you're looking to get  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:A_Decor> dressed <END>  to impress on a weekend night, as you'll just be getting those "uhh, move along  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> " stares from the other  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  night, but definitely a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to grab a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat, enjoy the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> , catch up with a friend, etc.  Lots of  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  too.
Great  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and comfy  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END>  options were so delicious. The  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list provides a large selection of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  was a bit long but  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I will be back.
We recently moved to Scottsdale, AZ and I was looking for a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with a great  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  and a great  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for my wife's birthday. I found several recommendations for 'Different Pointe of  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> '. We arrived around 6pm and were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  inside at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was front center looking out over the  <START:A_OutsideView> valley <END> . BEAUTIFUL  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> !!! The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was clean and very quiet. During our visit only 3 other parties  <START:Restaurant> dined <END> . If you want a quiet  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , you will find  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I found  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  odd  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> .We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Lobster Bisque and a Strawberries & Baby Wild Arugula  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Both were fresh and very tasty. We followed with our  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  courses, Cold  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  Diver  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and Wild California  <START:F_FoodItem> halibut <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  attempted to have the  <START:S_Staff> sommelier <END>  select a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  for us but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was no where to be found. The Maitre d' finally came over to assist.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  made selection  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't have. I selected a Merlot and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was very good.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have an impressive  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list and  <START:A_Places> cellar <END> .  Our  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  courses arrived and I knew right away  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my wife was not happy with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> . My  <START:F_FoodItem> halibut <END>  was delicious. We tried each others and I found the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  VERY over  <START:Offers> seasoned <END> , burnt on the exterior and cold in the center....  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were to the point of almost being inedible. Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  did not return to see how the  <START:Food> meal <END>  turned out so I switched  <START:Food> meals <END>  with my wife.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  birthday and I avoided raising a disturbance when our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  finally returned, after we had finished our  <START:Food> meal <END> . I ate the worst $32  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  course of my life. After a VERY DISAPPOINTING  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  course we avoided  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  were undersized and expensive for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . We will not be returning for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . We might for a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> . 'Dissapointing Pointe of  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> '
Would be a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  brought Siad back. When  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  ran  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was clean, fast and the  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  looked like  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  could work anywhere. Not so much anymore.
I think this  <START:Ambience> building <END>  was a  <START:A_Places> house <END>  before  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  turned  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  into a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  because the halls are a bit narrow and the  <START:A_Places> rooms <END>  are a bit small, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great!  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  give you  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  while you are  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for your  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  is home made and delicious!  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END>  are amazing and huge (if you get the large) and pretty strong ;) . I wouldn't suggest you don't go on a Friday night for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  do get pretty busy and the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  gets pretty long.
For a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I have not gone to KFC and on this night I felt I needed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ... I also had to try the Double Down  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .... I was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  with a very friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  with prompt fast  <START:Service> service <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Double Down with an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of Coleslaw, Mash Potatoes with  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  and one  <START:F_Ingredients> drum stick <END> ... I  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  as followed.Double Down  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  - DColeslaw - B+Mash Potatoes with  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  - B+ <START:F_Ingredients> drum stick <END>  - BI have always enjoyed some KFC every once in awhile... I was glad I had made this stop I forgot how much I like the Coleslaw and Mash Potatoes with  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  great stuff... I will be back again someday for sure.
 <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious, but agree with other reviewers. You don't get much for what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> . Way too pricey!
Wow I forgot how great Taco Bell is. I never realized  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had so many zero  <START:F_Ingredients> calorie <END>  options on  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . You might say What Taco Bell has zero  <START:F_Ingredients> calorie <END>  options you are crazy. To  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  I say no sir just about everything on  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is zero calories because once you throw  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up after you eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  you don't absorb any calories.I am sorry I don't usually rank on a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  this bad but this was really bad. I am sure some  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  just love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  but not this person. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  seemed nice enough. Although  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seemed like the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  on the registers second day on the job. Also when you just stuff the  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  still inside the wrapper in the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  where the  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  go and tear open the end  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is not really refilling the  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> . Just saying.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is tasteless and horrible. I wouldn't even feed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to my  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  because the ASPCA might come after me. I know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is harsh and I am being mean to get a laugh but this is the worst kind of fast  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  gives fast  <START:Food> food <END>  a bad name. I don't even dare call  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so far away from real Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has never even met real Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> . Real Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  would beat up Taco Bell  <START:Food> food <END>  if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  crossed paths.Like I said I know  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  just love Taco Bell but as for me I will try, shouldn't be  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hard, to never eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again. Sorry Taco Bell.
 <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not often I'm off on a Friday afternoon to enjoy  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> 's  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . This was our first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , normally we  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  at the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on Bell and 7th Street. I started off with a bowl of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  Southwestern  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was awesome. Just the right amount of spiciness combined with a hearty  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . My bf started out with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a little on the small side but  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  were fresh. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on a pretzel  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  and requested BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on the side instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> mayo <END> , the BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  didn't come so I asked again when  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  brought the  <START:Food> dish <END> . Wouldn't ya know I finished my whole  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and never got the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  (our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  didn't check on us after bringing the  <START:Food> food <END>  until  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to clear the  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> ). The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was tasty but a little on the dry side. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were piping hot and always well  <START:Offers> seasoned <END> . James  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  also came with  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was much harder than  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  should have been for just a toasted  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was a disappointment.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  also never received a refill on  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> . If we had gotten the BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , the refill of  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  not rock hard, I would have given 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for a wonderful  <START:Food> lunch <END> . But, since the ball was dropped on too many occasions, I can't. I will be back to  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> 's, just not this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .
 <START:Food> food <END>  was great. ...excellent customer  <START:Service> service <END> . . We went during world  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  finals,  great  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . ..  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  quickly,  decent  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> ,  casual  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . . We will go back next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> .
Good  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END>  and chargrilled  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . Brings back memories from my childhood getting  <START:Food> food <END>  with my dad. And the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are just right. I will be coming back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  often. I had a  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  was boiled and perfect. I then had a  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheeseburger <END> . Chargrilled  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  so good. Also had  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  on the side. And the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were...  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , nothing  <START:Offers> special <END> .
 <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  is excellent. Only been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> brunch <END>  but the  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> ,  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  selection is great. Friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  as well.
So my fiancé and I heard a lot of good things about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , so we decided to give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a try. We placed an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for pick up, and when we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  behind the counter had  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  head phones in and was pretty rude, like  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  didn't want to be bothered. So we got our  <START:Food> food <END> , we both  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  were not good at  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was sliced, grilled, and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was microwaved. The best part of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> , we were really disappointed and will not return. Big let down!
The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was great and the the pick up  <START:Service> service <END>  was polite.  I look forward to going back  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  in the future.
Forget the pricey  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  at the big name  <START:Restaurant> hotels <END> . Come to Yama  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  for the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  deal in town.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's only $21 for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and $23 for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  for AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . Unlike most AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  joints, Yama offers uni,  <START:F_FoodItem> hamachi kama <END> , sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , etc. (limit 1  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  per person for most).  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's almost never a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is decent for what you're  <START:O_Payment> paying <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's several  <START:Food> items <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I always get. The uni is a coin flip, but I've had pretty good tastings recently. I like the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , but I'm not a fan of the fried  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  accompanies  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> hamachi kama <END>  is huge and is sure to fill you up. My favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  is the wet dream,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  comes as a baked cali  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , and finished with sweet yam  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I always end with an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of white  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  nigiri ( <START:A_Entertainment> buttery <END>  goodness). If you don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , start with the seafood  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  is a poor man's chirashi bowl. Skip the soft shell  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  is too fried for my liking. Lastly, save  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  as you can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  and two scoops of  <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END> . The mango  <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  is fantastic and I'm a big fan of the  <START:F_Drinks> green   tea   <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> plum <END>   <START:F_FoodItem>   ice   creams <END> .
Great  <START:Food> food <END> , very very slow  <START:Service> service <END>  (took an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  to get  <START:Food> entrees <END> ) and a poor  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list. Unless you really know your Italian  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  very poor selection for the California grape lovers.
DAS BOOT!!! The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is the staple  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  keeps me coming back to the Essen Haus, especially with  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  selection of authentic German  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> . Outstanding  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and plenty of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , huge  <START:F_Ingredients> steins <END>  for little  <START:F_FI_Price> money <END> . The huge boot is only $15 on Thursday night, so happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  usually turns into happy late night!!The  <START:Food> food <END>  isn't bad, sits heavy if you're not ready of used to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  though. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  fry on Friday is pretty good too,  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  you can eat  <START:F_FoodItem> cod <END>  for $10 isn't bad!!
Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  wasn't  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  bad.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only took us ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was great especially when the  <START:A_LocatedArea> bellagio <END>   <START:A_Decor> fountain <END>  is right across the street.  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was reaaaaalllllyyyyyy slow.
For  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  of the great  <START:A_LocatedArea> places <END>  to eat in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> , I'd skip Pink Taco unless I were staying at the Hard Rock and needed something fast.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's pretty standard Americanized Mexican, but I think  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  dropped the ball in a few key areas.First off was the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were A+, some of the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  I've ever had.  But the  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> ...D-.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  gave us 3 different kinds:  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> -based, dark green,  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  green.  Each one  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  pretty much the same and had ZERO  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  to  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> .I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  came with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and also tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  skewers.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were basically  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> pico de gallo <END>  on a  <START:F_FoodItem> tortilla <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were good, but how about a little  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and seasoning to the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> !  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  skewers had a little  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  to  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  (finally!).The  <START:Service> service <END>  was quick and everything came out correctly, but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was clearly not in a mood to be friendly with a group of 16 guys who tip well.   <START:S_Staff> her <END>  loss I suppose.
We were in Las  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END>  for a mid-week business event and stayed at the Venetian. We made advanced  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  before arriving in LV through Open  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .com. Everything went smoothly and the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  called each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  (we ate two  <START:F_FoodItem> dinners <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> ) to confirm  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  the day of the  <START:Food> meal <END> . Both  <START:Food> meals <END>  were pretty much flawless. We each seemed to especially enjoy any of the nightly  <START:Offers> specials <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  happened to be hanger  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and some other goodies.
Fantastic café  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in Venetian's spa.  I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  thanks to the Yelp app because I was looking for a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END>  and I was staying in this  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  of the Strip.  Canyon Ranch is great because you can create your own  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  use REAL  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> .  This is not  <START:F_Drinks> juices <END>  or  <START:F_Dessert> sorbets <END>  or what have you.  The 20 ounce is $9,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  is definitely higher than your local Jamba  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END> , but considering the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  (one of the nicest  <START:Restaurant> hotels <END>  on the Strip) plus the fact  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  use real  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  (when no one else near  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  does) I think the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  is totally fine.  I have pretty specific instructions regarding my  <START:F_Drinks> smoothies <END> , I like to have  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  how I make  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  at home.  Canyon Ranch did a great job.   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  three days I had a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  named Michael make my  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fantastic and consistent.  Can't recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  enough if you are in need of a  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END> .The  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  was the only  <START:Food> food <END>  item I tried, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the reason I am giving Canyon Ranch 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  instead of 5.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  may be why  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't resonate with me.  Too much going on perhaps.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was something in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I couldn't put my finger on for  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  I didn't care.  I didn't even eat half of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  So, I would not get this again, but I know where to get my daily  <START:F_Drinks> smoothie <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I am in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> .
Best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> .  Go on the weekend for the gourmet  <START:Food> buffet <END>  with Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and rack of  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END> .  Kobe was tougher than the prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> , but the  <START:A_LocatedArea> land <END>  was great.   <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were ok.  Overcooked, and  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Awesome  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .
This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is an excellent example of Las  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END>  fine dining at its best. Some excellent highlights; the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  are fantastically made, the seafood trio  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  is a MUST when dining  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and the  <START:Service> service <END>  should be, and was, perfect. We truly enjoyed our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are many fine dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Las  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END>  to choose from,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are few  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  tend to get  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  those key foodList and  <START:Service> service <END>  standards working together harmoniously perfect such as AquaKnox.
The ONLY reason I give this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  four  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  instead of five is because the  <START:Service> service <END>  was lacking a bit.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took forever for us to get  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> /extra  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> / <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> . Other than  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  was outstanding. We came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on Memorial Day because we were too lazy to do our own grilling, and after smelling our neighbors cooking some  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , we just had to have  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> !We got the fire roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> artichoke <END>  for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . My only complaint is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> artichoke <END>  was not very meaty and if I'm  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  $10 for an  <START:F_FoodItem> artichoke <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  shouldn't be small with  <START:F_Ingredients> leaves <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hardly have  <START:Food> anything <END>  to grab at. The  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> mayo <END>  dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was delicious! My gf and I shared the Lucille's platter -  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came w/ two  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breasts, four  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , a few slices of tri-tip  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and two sides. We opted for  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  and french  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Every single  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of this  <START:Food> meal <END>  was delicious. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was fall-off-the-bone tender and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was impressive too (usually  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is just blah for me). The tri-tip was absolutely phenomenal. We ate the entire platter and brought one huge  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast home, so these  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  do not mess around! The  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  was also really really good.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was obvious  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fresh and grilled and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was some type of  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was extremely  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> , I will definitely be back the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm craving some southern BBQ.Be weary, the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are a little high compared to other BBQ joints around  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , but I do think the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  and the preparation is  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !
I LOVE the  <START:Food> food <END>  concept,  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  and have had great  <START:Food> food <END>  almost every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I've been  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . The only drawback is  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  system. If you don't come often,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's hard to remember  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the abbreviations and details needed for  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  form.  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  hasn't always been eager to make the  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  process easier either.  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>  figuring out  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  system for the  <START:Food> food <END>  though!
I love this Central and South American  <START:Food> eatery <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  features everything from  <START:F_FoodItem> chimichangas <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> tortas <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .You have to get the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  ($1.95). The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were thick and crispy, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  had a nice  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  went great with my strong but sweet Passion  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  Sangria ($6.95),  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was the perfect complement to the heat-filled  <START:Food> meal <END> .I had two  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  ($9.95) smothered in the vegetarian red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  came with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> -I got black  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> . The  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  was large, and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great-the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were bold, and everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh.Besides the yummy  <START:Food> food <END> , I also appreciated Ticoz for its  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had a dark and romantic vibe, with burnt  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:A_Decor> walls <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  gave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a warm and cozy  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Ticoz is owned by Tom Jetland, who also owns Phoenix  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  FEZ and Switch. I'd have to say Switch is my favorite of the three, but you can't really go wrong with any of  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> .
Social  <START:A_Places> house <END>  is good, but damn is this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  pricey. I had  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and small  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  when I was recently in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> . When perusing  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  I noticed  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy   pata   <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy   pata   <END>  is an old school filipino  <START:Food> dish <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a deep fried  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  knuckle  <START:Service> served <END>  with soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  for dipping. Don't knock  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  until you try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  !  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was staple at our  <START:A_Places> house <END>  when my dad and uncles would  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  together. Total comfort  <START:Food> food <END>  for me.  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy   pata   <END>  is also known for being hella cheap too.  My wife and I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy   pata   <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  bomb. The skin was crispy and  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was juicy and not too greasy.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was as good as the hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> filipino   places   <END>  in LA , but damn $28 though? My lola is probably turning over in  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  grave if  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  knew how much we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  damn savory, juicy, deep fried  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  knuckle goodness. Sorry lola! =(The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> ,  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  at Social  <START:A_Places> house <END>  is great. Although, the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  did remind me of a more upscale version of PF changs. Not hating. Just keepin  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  real. Plus I love PF Changs.3.55  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> , rounding up to 4.
The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly (  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  know your name and what you like) <START:Food> food <END>  is FRESH prepared well and  <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>  hot. Only  <START:A_LocatedArea> issue <END>  is  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  rush. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is good and " <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> " takes  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is soooo good at Hash  <START:A_Places> house <END> - whenever I have guests in town this is the first stop! Plus, this is a pretty popular  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  so  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  may have a short  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  but its so  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  !! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is HUGE- quite literally, 1  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  could feed 2-3  <START:S_Staff> people <END> . So, what I would suggest is  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a few things with your group and share! My favorite  <START:Food> dish <END>  is the Grilled French  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  and my hubby loves the Sage Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem>   bacon   waffles <END> !
I ate at Harley's for the first, of what will be many,  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  last night. The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is perfect. Romantic and quiet enough for a  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END> , but still casual and fun enough for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with friends.  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> ,  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and the  <START:Service> service <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  great. I was a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  for a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and I know what crappy  <START:Service> service <END>  looks like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Also, one of the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  hung out and talked to my friends and I and tended  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ! I was very impressed at how friendly  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was. Lastly, if you haven't had  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  Bistro  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  you need to stop what you are doing and drive  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  right now.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a secrete  <START:F_Ingredients> recipe <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesy <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> gooey <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlicky <END> , goodness on toasted  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . Delicious! I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  again. Maybe this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I will try  <START:Food> brunch <END> . :)
I enjoyed  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at Les Artistes. I had the 50% of  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Food> entree <END>  coupon, but be warned  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is doesn't apply to EVERTHING on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very friendly though and explained how  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  worked and what was available for the 50% off. I ended up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and with the  <START:Offers> discount <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was only $15!  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were really good, very  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  well. For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  I had the  <START:F_Dessert> creme brulee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was also very delicious. I recommend this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but make sure you get the coupon!
If you end up in  Henderson for any reason, stop by this little gem. Excellent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , classic and innovative  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  Unagi  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  is delicious. Highly recommended!
While my band was recording our latest album nearby, we ate  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  about 3-4  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  a week....Full of kicks and the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are definitely complimentary to the overload of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> .The only reason  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  doesnt get a %100 percent review is because the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  are not bad, but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are not noteworthy.....Try the Jamaican Jerk  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  if you are into spicy  <START:Food> food <END> ....  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  will  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burn <END>  your tongue for days!!  <START:F_FoodItem> hottest <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on earth and I have had  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> !!!
Im always on the search  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in AZ for a great  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ..AND I feel bad for my friend who tried to impress me and lure me away from my norm.. (Postino & Kaz).. SO  I want to love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .. I just dont.(I didnt tell  <START:S_Staff> him <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  though... <START:S_Staff> he <END>  came up with the end result on  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  own)...  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is cute...  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  flights are good..& decently  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> ... .  <START:Food> food <END>  is blech...  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and knowledgable.... Do I like its  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> ?? No.. Nothing interested either my friend or I on the apps.. Keep searching??. guess so...
I placed my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  online and showed up at my designated  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on Christmas Eve only to find one long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  weaved through the business and out the door.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no separate  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  for those who already  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . Once in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for 45  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  behind a person with serious intestinal issues. Once I got to the front of the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , I asked if  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wanted my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  number and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't necessary.... Then why did I bother placing an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END> ???? As I told  <START:S_Staff> him <END>  my list of  <START:Food> items <END> , I asked for the $6.99 mini  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  from my online  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't have  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . I inquired about what  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had comparable and was told a full- <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  sampler for $14.99. I started to complain and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  called over another  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  who proceeded to tell me the website is not indicative of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  selection. WHAT???? I was at a complete loss.Fortunately, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing and the package deals made the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  very reasonable. I will probably go back, but begrudgingly.
Always a perfect five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  eating  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I'm in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  business and I can appreciate when a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  goes the extra mile to make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  fresh with  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> .
I found this looking just at reviews and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>  the high marks. I stopped for takeout since  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  sounded boring. We got the fried  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  and spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  delicious. Very nice  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  and very authentic Pho. Don't let the strip mall fool you this is a gem.
We ate and partied on the  <START:Restaurant> rooftop deck lounge <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was really great.  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was solid and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fun to look out on the strip.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  can be very warm  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  at night, so be sure to  <START:A_Decor> dress <END>  for the warm weather and you'll be happy too. <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a mostly indoors  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  downstairs with the same  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  but is much more protected from the weather.
My husband and I simply love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . We have been  <START:F_Drinks> patrons <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for over 10 years and although the  <START:Food> food <END>  is pricey since everything is a la carte,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is well  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>  every penny. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  also offers a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  we have taken advantage of once or twice, however, we mainly love  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dinners <END> . The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is extremely friendly and attentive. I highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tikka masala <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is to die for. I also love the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  korma, again fantastic  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . You can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  mild, medium or spicy.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have recently really ramped up the spicy, so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is very spicy indeed. Can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again soon.
Delights  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  just started  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END>  the week we arrived for our stay at The Signature.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offer a selection of baked goods,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and gelato/ <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END> , along with  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and other  <START:F_Appetizer> snack <END>   <START:Food> items <END> .  We were highly impressed with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  During our stay we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lox <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbread <END> , brioche french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END> -and-swiss panini, and the forest  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  quiche --  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  delicious and  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  prepared fresh.  We also had  <START:F_Dessert> yogurt <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  parfaits every morning.  Since you do have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  while  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  prepare your  <START:Food> meals <END> , you can just relax  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  faces toward The Signature's private pool  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  on a nice day or inside the pleasant  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  itself.You'll find Delights  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  in Tower 2.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a good value for the non-dinnertime  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> -splurge, and very convenient while staying at The Signature.
This is the best AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> ! We always come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a great  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and good  <START:F_FoodItem> eats <END> !! The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  are amazing!!
Pasta amazing but only app  <START:A_Places> portion <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  were not considered "great" by those  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and for $61 for a NY Strip, I would hope for "great" at the least.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> halibut <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was prepared nicely.   <START:Service> service <END>  was very disappointing and not up to the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END> .  Would not go again considering  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the amazing  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Las  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> . If  <START:F_FI_Price> pirced <END>  more resonably then I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a pass but you must consider the whole package in this case.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be like getting a Tiffany  <START:F_FI_Quality> box <END>  and finding a WalMart ring inside...not bad, but certainl not going to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  Tiffany  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  Sorry.  Oh, yeah, the Barolo was amazing, but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  did not make  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .
I ate at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  first opened and thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great.  Creative  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  and delicious  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END> .  Great dining option for both locals and of course strip tourists.
amazing execution. Nice and creative  <START:F_Ingredients> recipe <END> . nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  a bit too relaxed for the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but I guess is the the Quebec way.... Make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a stop when you are in Montreal, you wont regret  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .
This is a good  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Restaurant> chain <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is consistently good, if not great, across the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have different  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  available. Definitely not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  you can get (the  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  is not thin or cracker-like enough) but the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavour <END>  combinations are good.  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  are also generally good.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> treat <END>  kids very well and keep  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  entertained with nice giveaways.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is definitely a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , but a good one for the genre.
1st impressions are everything right? Well I will never return again. I'd love to tell you about the  <START:Food> food <END> , I'd love to tell you about the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , however, I can't. Saturday 3.22 a group of 6 of us entered wild  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  at around 11pm. We were quickly sat by a  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's pretty much the end of our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . We sat at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  for 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  trying multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to flag down a  <START:S_Staff> server <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> leprechaun <END> , or anyone who would get us  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . After 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  of no success we left saying how bad  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was to the girl at the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  stand, we were shrugged off. The next day I sent wild  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  an email....  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's now Thursday, no response thus I assume you don't care about your customers.
Have visited this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  countless  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  over the years. First was a trip with my dad but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has now turned into a nice wee convenient  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to pop into when visiting friends who need to be close to public transport. As Stephanie has pointed out, if you want to learn about the little  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  so many love, then ditch the old tatty book your granny gave you and just get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  in and wander about this little gem to learn and love the story. The pub itself is in a wee  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END> , with a proper boozer feel to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is full of friendly punters.For  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I have never had  <START:Food> anything <END>  to eat until last week. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Arbroath Smokie Fishcakes and my girlfriend went for the Curried  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  Shank with Apricots. Both were bluudy marvellous and very reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  - around 7/8 quid each. A brilliant staple in the city centre  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  and come highly recommended.
Just about keeled over when a pint of  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> , pint of Deuchars and a pot of  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  came to the paltry sum of £6.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is genuinely impressive for a city centre  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with pleasant  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and comfy  <START:A_Furniture> couches <END> . Bloke behind the counter was very chipper and friendly too. And great  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  playing.WILL BE BACK.
Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with some friends for  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and were thoroughly impressed.  Would've given  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .... not sure why I'm not...?Started with Blood  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END> .... my friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mine frozen, prefer the rocks much more.  More  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , less brain freeze...Could drown in a bowl of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> -side Guac.  As others have stated before, perfect combination, spicy without compromising  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .Had the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , tender, juicy, and delicious, and after devouring a ton of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  was enough to fill me up, but my hubby had the diver  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> , and was still hungry...  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  great, less filling.Our friends RAVED about the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END> , personally I can't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  when I go out to eat.  No matter how good  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  may be, I feel like I should eat something more exotic. <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is everything.  Uber cool spanish  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  with a splash of classy flair. Dark, loud, and super sexy.  Fun for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with friends, or a hot  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END> .
Don't waste your  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  or  <START:F_FI_Price> money <END> ..... Small  <START:Food> buffet <END>  with few options, low  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , and poor  <START:Service> service <END> ..   Go to the Suncoast or McDonalds down the street
Just arrived from  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  Jungle on 44th and Indian School. As I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to give my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  I had the feeling  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I should be running for the hills. First off in a city where salutations are as commonplace as dust I don't think I even heard a faint hello from  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  four  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  hanging out no more than 2 feet from the front door (2 of  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  were  <START:S_Staff> hostesses <END> ) - something told me Papa Bear was not  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to mind the roost.As if the  <START:Service> service <END>  wasn't already a telltale sign, I went ahead and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  what I thought would be a semblance of a good  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . However, I should've known when the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  brought over my bagged  <START:Food> food <END>  handed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to me as if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  were the remnants (read:  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> ) from  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  pooch in the bag. Sorry--grew up in NYC have been eating  <START:F_FoodItem> pitas <END> , et. al since I was a wee one, This was awful. I purposely do not own a microwave to avoid the temptation of ever putting my  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I was  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for chewy  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , awfully  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Sorry  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  Jungle, but maybe a good heart to heart  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  meeting may deem necessary--re-evaluate the customer and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> act <END>  accordingly---Hint: starts with "human"!
I really like Scramble. I take my Dad  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  whenever  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  is town to visit. I love how you walk up to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at the register and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> , but then your  <START:Food> food <END>  is brought to you.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offer loose leaf  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  I am a huge fan of..I always get the chamomile.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not an overly greasy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , like many  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Ambience> establishments <END>  are, and overall,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's very charming. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very friendly,  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  healthy looking themselves, and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  run an efficient ship.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's always a little busy when I go on the weekends, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's never been an unreasonable  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .
Red Robin is the array of hot girls I  <START:F_FoodItem> dated <END>  in my youth. Looks good, nice to  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  off, everything is nice...at first! Friendly  <START:Service> service <END>  greets you and takes your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in a well-kept and energetic  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> . As you  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  longer and longer for you  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would seem your bipolar  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> /hot girlfriend is starting to drift to the darkside. <START:Food> food <END>  arrives and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's great! Just what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  know what  <START:Restaurant> they <END> 're doing. I knew  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  girl wasn't crazy. I guess I'll keep  <START:F_FoodItem> dating <END>   <START:S_Staff> her <END> .Check arrives. Dang, didn't I look at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END> ? I didn't realize  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was this high maintenance. Maybe  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  purse was Gucci in disguise. Maybe I'm really at Spago. Okay...so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  expensive...but you could have a got a Big Daddy's  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  for a similar  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> .I  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this a four based off the  <START:Food> food <END>  mostly. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is sketchy in a ticket scalper sort of way...and the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are the same.
I have been to Kaya three  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  within the past month.  And I can give  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  a solid 4.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  each and every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .First visit:* Steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Belly (Marinated and steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Belly with condiments) $15.95 - Comes with  <START:F_Ingredients> leaves <END> , thinly sliced radish, sliced  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> , sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> , kimchee, etc.   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  altogether with a slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly and oh so yum.  Definitely meant for sharing, and more than enough for two  <START:S_Staff> people <END> !* Korean Seafood  <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>  - Loaded with lots of seafood, and really good.* Spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  - Generous  <START:A_Places> portion <END> , but perhaps a bit too much. * Something Wrong  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  - Whatever was in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was really good and we were fighting to get an extra piece.Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was super helpful and we didn't know what else to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  beyond the seafood  <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END> .   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made the other recommendations and were so very pleased with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  suggestions.    Second visit: New addition to the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  for $22.95 (until midnight).  Beyond the standard nigiri,  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , we also had:* Bulgogi (steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ) - Generous for one, so go with one  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  first to see if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's something you like.* Skewers:  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , gingko,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  gizzard,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , beefCame for a small party and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were very accommodating for our group.  Even brought out a  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  for the birthday boy and didn't complain with  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the splitting of the checks.  Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , Sunny, took care of us and really made sure we were having a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .Third visit: AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  again!* Steamed black mussel* Ahi poki* Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> jabchae <END> * Spicy Korean ramen* Skewers:  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END> , mushroomService was a bit slower this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  apologized and threw in a bottle of free  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .  We didn't mind as much since we got to linger and enjoy our  <START:Food> meal <END>  more.  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  nigiri is pretty good.  Generous slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and not a whole lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's pretty much what had us coming back the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for AYCE.  Skewers as part of the AYCE  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is also what we enjoyed - especially the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  gizzards, the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , etc.   <START:Restaurant> their <END>  steamed black mussels came with a creamy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was good.  Soft shell  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  are also available, including  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  included are udon and ramen.   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  include fried  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  bowls. <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  is limited to vanilla,  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>  or  <START:F_Drinks> green   tea   <END>   <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END> , limit one.For a relatively new  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are busy!  We even saw Mr. Lee's son the last two  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  we went! (From Lee's Liquor)  AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  with some Korean thrown in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ?  Works for us and we have very pleased bellies when we leave. <START:Restaurant> they <END>  also have a frequent visitor card - Buy 10 AYCE, get 1 free!(Pics posted!)
The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good... for a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was exactly what we expect from the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory.... consistent with  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the other  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factories I had been to. Don't get me wrong... my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and I LOVE the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a guilty pleasure.... The things  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  irked me about this particular  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> :1.   <START:S_Parking> parking <END> : what a pain! luckily  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had valet ( <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  we used...awesome!) however we had a large party and one  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  had a baby and i KNOW  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:A_Places> parked <END>  uber far and had to carry the infant  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and everything....2.   <START:Service> service <END> : what a nightmare.  I don't even know our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> 's name.   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  I remember is  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was blond, and short (not in stature, but  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attitude <END> -wise).  Granted we had a large party (13  <START:S_Staff> people <END> ) ... uh oh...  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's where i go off on a rant.So we had a large party.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was my (pregnant) sister-in-law's birthday. We had 3 children with us 10 adults... we  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  arrived within 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  We had asked the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  until we were  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to start taking  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> .... but  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  didn't feel  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was a good idea.  I personally felt  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we got the short end of the stick because we were a large party and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  felt  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  did not have to give us good  <START:Service> service <END>  because  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was already getting auto-gratted.  Boo on  <START:S_Staff> her <END> .  Tip karma forces my boyfriend (who picked up the tab  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  night) to automatically tip AT LEAST 25 percent (instead of the, what, 18 percent auto gratuity on parties of 6 or more?)anywho,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  came out staggered.  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  came out staggered.   <START:Food> food <END>  came out staggered....  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  because the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  did not want to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  the few  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  of us to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  and get situated.  rawr.and on top of  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , some rude lady in a near by  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  kept shushing the 2 4-year olds with us (one being my daughter) and shooting dirty looks my way. lucky for  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  my parents taught me to respect my ugly... i mean elders. <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  being said (please excuse my poor grammar/run-on sentences)...bottom  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> :   <START:Food> food <END>  was consistent with every other  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  factory out  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  (yay for avocado eggrolls and THE BEST fried  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  in the world) but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was shoddy (really though, WHY would you bring out  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else and then make the 2 restless 4-year old girls  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  10 more  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for theirs? who does  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> ?!?) I'll stick to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in Henderson, or even brave the strip and head to the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory in Caesar's.
Mmmmm. Never disappoints.  Kind of small  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , definitely has  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  feel.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a Quiet  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's okay,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  aren't rude or  <START:Food> anything <END> , I much rather be busy eating my yummers! Pho  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , so delish. No complaints from me!
Oh wow. We stopped by this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  after hiking at red rock. We live on the other side of town but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! If you like interesting  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  try the Ultimate  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , crazy horse, or 3Alarm fire. Bu we also had some  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  pieces. Wow so fresh and huge!
We've been having trouble going to  <START:A_LocatedArea> places <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  are fine dining lately.  We had a couple of bad  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  where the  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  just did not match our expectations.  This was not the case  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a la carte, a lot of  <START:Food> food <END>  and were completely happy.Sweetbreads - always my favorite, and these were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly.Octopus - Big pieces of braised octopus  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were charred, lovely.Charcuterie  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  -  <START:F_FoodItem> pickled <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END> ?  Yes please!  beautiful  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  selection. <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Tartare - The  <START:Food> texture <END>  of this  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  was so perfect and I loved the  <START:F_FI_Taste> saltiness <END>  of the  <START:F_Ingredients> capers <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  in,  <START:Service> served <END>  with grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  shouldn't scare you off, you can't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just adds a nice crunch to the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Belly - not sure how  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  this one, but the  <START:Food> texture <END>  was just phenomenal.  Still super moist but falling apart.  I rarely eat  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END>  but this one was great.We finished off with  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  were  <START:Service> served <END>  with a tobasco sorbet.  I don't love big briny  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , but these were small and sweet and were just wonderful.We had an Intermezzo of white  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  filled with a meyer lemon  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and some celery.  Honestly.  I don't think words can describe what an amazing 2  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was. <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were phenomenal as well, My favorite was probably the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  with hazelnut.  But The  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  strussel with  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's right the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  not the  <START:Food> chocolate <END> )  <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END>  was phenomenal as well.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was also great, very friendly and warm.  We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and had a lovely  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  I highly recommend.
While walking by I noticed a sign for bubble  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and was immediately drawn in. I asked if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  showed me to a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and turned the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to the proper page. I looked through  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and was a tad sad  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't list almond as one of the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  carry but decided on taro.On a lark, before  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> , I asked the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  ever planned on carrying almond.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  looked at me with a perplexed manner and stated  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END> , in fact, carry almond for  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  bubble  <START:F_Drinks> teas <END> . I then asked if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  carried  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END>  since  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  is my favorite and almond wasn't on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . With a no given for my second question I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  by almond  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . This day I learned I can get good almond  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  with pearls in the Strip District while the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  learned  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  needs to add almond to the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I told  <START:S_Staff> him <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  should list  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  as amaretto since more  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  know almond  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  by  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  description.
I really wanted to like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .I like the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> ; the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was clean, and you'd be hard pressed to find a harder working  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  was poor.The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  cutlet parmigiana  <START:F_FoodItem> dinners <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my Wife & I had were off in a thousand ways:-  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was a little thin, and way too sweet.- Poultry  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  could've been better.-  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was deep fried, instead of pan fried, and, along with the breading/seasoning, the  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like a cheap spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  nugget covered with  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .- A small slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  with the  <START:Food> entree <END> , instead of a customary  <START:F_Ingredients> loaf <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  before/with  <START:Food> dinner <END> .Seldom do I find myself speaking poorly of a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ...in fact, this is my first critical review of a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on Yelp.
 <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  friendly.Dropped in for some  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with the  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  one night. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was pretty standard but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was the great and best part of this business.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was attentive and pleasent.My son was given a high  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>   had fun giving  <START:S_Staff> him <END>  custom little  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END>  with bird faces  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  loved  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !Recommend the banana  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> !!

Am I in Heaven?  I think I'm in love with this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  One of my besties' took me to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> brunch <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's when I fell in love.  Yeah, I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for the Red Velvet Waffles w/  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  drizzled on top because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sound intriguing but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  wasn't the highligh of my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  When we walked into this beautiful  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> , I loved the soft and easy low-key tones of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  I felt like we were in a movie.  Although  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was packed, the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  was very relaxing and comforting.  The  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  of the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  for me was definitely the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  sausage ( <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  is made fresh at the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ).   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I am still at a loss for words!   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is definitely something  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you'd have to try for yourself.  So let me back up a bit,  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the red velvet waffles,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  sausage, and stone ground  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  w/  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .   Lately, I have to admit, I have not liked anyone's  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  besides my own, but let me tell you...if you're craving  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  and you don't want to make  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  yourself--give this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a try.  I personally cannot  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back and try other things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is better than average fast  <START:Food> food <END> . I especially liked the  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> 
I know  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but I am not sure what  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the hubbub is about.  I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on a Friday night around 9pm.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was pretty dead. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was super loud,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were weak and over  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tvs <END>  every inch of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , with  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END> , yuck.
Ok, before I start my actual review, PLEASE READ: when you go to this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is not a "sit and chat" type  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  Japanese ramen  <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  where you eat your ramen fast and leave. Not trying to sound rude or pushy, but please respect this Japanese tradition. Plus, the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  gets really long really fast, especially at noon.The spicy Tonkotsu Ramen is my favorite.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's always listed as a  <START:Offers> special <END> . I get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  added in. I LOVE  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is my second favorite. My parents love the cold  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  too.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just such a unique  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  despite being so short. But hey, studies  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  with fewer  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> , you're usually happier. If you aren't full after one bowl, you can ask for a refill of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  for (I believe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's $2). But  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  won't give you extra broth for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END> , so save enough broth if you know you'll need another  <START:S_Staff> serving <END> .
Not great, not awful.  I just wasn't terribly impressed....  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  keeps telling me how great  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are but I didn't think  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Offers> special <END> .    <START:Restaurant> they <END>  do give you a TON of  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> .... my husband and I split a large  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of the Cajun  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and only finished about 1/3 of what  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  gave us.    I did appreciate the large array of  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  available to customize the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  to your liking, especially fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> .  Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'll skip the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and stick to the single  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  for a "fast  <START:Food> food <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was pretty tasty!
Another tasty cheap  <START:Food> meal <END> . Thank you Montreal for being so generous like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . $6 I think for a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END> , and free conversation with the friendly Lebanese man who works  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Or owns  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Nice  <START:S_Staff> people <END> , good  <START:Food> food <END> , win.
Gotta love filiberto's!  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  messed up on my  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  once and didn't notice until i got home and took a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> ! Only live about 1  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  away so I ran back and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  get me a free  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  quickly made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  right and also gave me a vip customer  <START:Offers> discount <END>  card to use everytime! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is always yummy!
This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is truly fresh, tasty,  has a very nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  is friendly and informative.Great stuff! Fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  is incredible....and the fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  are just  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> ...FRESH!
Smashburger is one of my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  because I find  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to be tastier than most  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  out  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I like this new  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  a lot for the same reasons I like the other Smashburger  <START:Ambience> establishments <END>  - tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , friendly and efficient  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , bright and clean  <START:A_Decor> interiors <END>  and exterior, a comfy  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  for al fresco dining. Great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  too, in a shopping  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is not too busy so  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is not a problem. I guess my only "complaint" is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is only 2 blocks from my gym, making  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  hard to resist when I pass by hungry after a workout ;)
I have been dying to try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  because I am a big fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I will keep this review very simple for you. Three wordsOversaltedOverpricedOverratedCheeseburger,  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  at Smashburger= $10Cheeseburger,  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  at In n Out= $ 6.59How's  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  for simple?
Came in and was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  before a party of six, we were 3 adults and 2 babies. The party of 6 was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  next to us. The  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  took our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and I told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  I was ready to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  would be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  soon to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ( where's the real  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> ) after  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  we finally got our  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and next to us got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I once again reminded the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  we were ready to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  now another 10  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  went by and the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  went to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  next to us and took  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and completely ignored us! Horrible we  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  got up and left!
I went to Pura Vida this morning at 7:10 to avoid any long  <START:S_Del_Time> waits <END> . I usually go to bed at 6 AM so I was surprised I was still up. I talked to Cindy about my Groupon options and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was very helpful. I ended up with the Latin'Tude and Tha Waffle. Everything  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is made fresh and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . So even though I was  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  first customer, I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  40  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for my togo. I had no problem with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I came home and ate a third of Tha Waffle.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fluffy and the hint of  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>  was perfect. I have yet to try my Latin'tude. Cindy did suggest calling ahead of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  or placing a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  the night before if I was in a rush next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a cute little spot with great  <START:Food> food <END> ! I'll be coming back.
 <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  are excellent, I drive across town for this one.  The little sweet lady  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  owns and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is a doll.
I grew up in Michigan and one of my favorite Mongolian stir fry  <START:A_LocatedArea> places <END>  anywhere was within driving distance. Unfortunately,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are not in Phoenix. And since moving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  I've been looking for another  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get my fix.Genghis Grill is the best I've found yet in the  <START:A_OutsideView> valley <END> . Not quite a perfect replacement but I certainly think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is pretty good. Choosing your  <START:F_Ingredients> starch <END>  was a nice touch. Not  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  feels like  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> .I feel like some of the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  are pretty  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  does give you the ability to experiment. Also  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are options on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for kids  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  may not be into stir fry.The only complication we had for  <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we both went to build our  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> . While gone, our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was bussed. Having some sort of card  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  says someone is at this  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  may deal with  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  possible confusion. Also if you decide you want more than 1 bowl, having to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  can be frustrating. I understand  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  makes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  easier to figure out who got 1 bowl vs  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  you can eat. But when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is busy, you may be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  a while if you want seconds or (somehow) thirds.
For the last 6 months ive been hitting up HOT n JUICY atleast 3  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  a month. Im still not  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burned <END>  out from  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  haha. Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we hit  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up we would alwayse  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  something different from the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we are never disapointed. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is soooooo yummy,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I sometime  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to go so I could eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  the next day. I love this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  alot better than the first one cause its not as busy, you don't have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  40  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> :) I personally can not stand  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  more than 20  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  nomatter how good the  <START:Food> food <END>  is. This  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  got my stamp of approval :)
Vegans get a bad rap.  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  seem to think  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  we eat are sprouts and  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . We  <START:F_FoodItem> eats <END>  so much more and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is outright delicious! Green is the best example of vegan comfort  <START:Food> food <END> !  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  even  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> ! Even if you are not vegan you totally have to try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Excellent  <START:Food> food <END> , friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  as well as a really enjoyable  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Try the por boy  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  as well as the great  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are my favorite! You forget  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are not made out of real  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
 <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was good & so was the  <START:Food> food <END> . Decent  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END> . Not my number 1  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but heck of a lot better than any more easy of Nevada!
Margarita  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   was like out of a  <START:F_FI_Quality> box <END>  from grocery  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  weird . The hummus was not authentic . The  <START:F_Drinks> smoothies <END>  were  <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  I can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was the powder or syrup  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  used to blended . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my sister got was sooo small  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  looked like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was for a 6 year old child not an adult.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was very over  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  we spend almost $50 for the both if us for  <START:Food> lunch <END> &  the funny thing we were still hungry the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  are really small. We really want  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to like this new  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not for us.
Oh, those pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> !!!I've had nothing but good  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  with Vocelli since moving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  this past May - in fact, this was the first  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  from, since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was so late by the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we got  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the only  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  open.  The online  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  system  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have is slick and user-friendly,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are always coupons, and the  <START:Food> food <END>  has always been hot and delicious on arrival. I'm holding back from giving  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  because the only things  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  really wow me (and boy, do  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  wow me) are the pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and the breadsticks.  The small  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are a great  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  for two, the "Neapolitan"  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  (kind of like a thinner, round Sicilian) is inventive and delicious, and the boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are reliably good (if unimaginative).  The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sticks aren't really  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , the " <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders 'taliano" were a little greasy, and the hoagies weren't  <START:Food> anything <END>  to write home about.  Go with the classics, and ask for extra  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> !(The fiance weighs in: The regular  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are good, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders 'taliano are fine, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is REALLY great!, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  and boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are underwhelming.  "And the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sticks,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , whatever the ****  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  call  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , is NOT  <START:W_Waiting> worth <END>  trying.")
Verrrrrrrrrry good. Nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I had fried green  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END> , , greens & the  <START:A_Places> house <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  were awesome! But the best of the best was the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:Food> chocolate <END>  sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> !
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great and allows you to eat what you like and as much or little as you would like. I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and frequent  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  often. Great for large parties
After unexpectedly ending up Downtown on a Wednesday night and not being able to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at Butcher and the Rye, my husband and I decided to try Vallozzi's for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  On a few previous occasions, I had  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  during happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  with friends.  The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was always good, the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  delicious, and the apps tasty, but I had never actually eaten in the dining  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> .After my dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  last night, I think I'll only be returning for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  in the future. Let me first say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:Service> service <END>  was probably the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> .  Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was polite, amiable, and very attentive.  I didn't have to flag  <START:S_Staff> him <END>  down once, although  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was taking care of several  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  around us.  The  <START:Food> food <END> , on the other hand, was a different story.   <START:Food> dinner <END>  started out well, as I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> shishito peppers <END>  and was in heaven.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and appropriately  <START:F_Ingredients> salted <END> /oiled.  For my  <START:Food> meal <END>  I had butternut  <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was so sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I couldn't finish the small bowl.  I also shared brussels sprouts with my husband and was pretty disappointed by the amount of  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  in the  <START:Food> dish <END> . (I didn't even realize  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sprouts could  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  unhealthy until I had these!) My husband had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  chop ( <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was fried) and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was generally happy with  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  selection.Overall, our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was okay, but I certainly won't be rushing back anytime soon.
I just saw someone's review about the savory  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> , lol,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  was described as tasting like  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the same thing and I guess  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  kind of did now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I think about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  though,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  pretty good to me and hit the spot for me but I can't understand where  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  person was coming from. The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  was about $12 and for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  amount, yeah, I want  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to be less "soupy" and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would have been nice to see the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  stuff the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  in front of me instead of crouching down into a " <START:A_Furniture> fridge <END> " to  <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up. <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  was average and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  were good, just way overpriced for a walk up joint. For the same amount we spent for this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , we could have gone to a French  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> -but its good if you are just trying to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and go. The  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  is a bit long but staring and looking at the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:A_Decor> fountain <END>  can help distract the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .I personally wouldn't make this a destination but might consider  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  again if I were in the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> . <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a general  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is on a first come first  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  basis next to the counter.
Mike's great  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  and enviorment make this a wonderful spot regardless if Chicago  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>  are your thing...........One couldn't ask for a more engaging host or  better  <START:Food> food <END> !   I would highly recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to anyone.
Mom's out of town for Thanksgiving so what do two grown men do???   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  go out to eat!  This  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  brought us to Ben & Jacks in Old Town.  I've eaten at Peter Luger's in New York but never one of Ben & Jacks spin-offs so I was excited to try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The  <START:Food> dinner <END>  started off at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  for a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> .  Guinness on draft is always a good idea but in a 10oz glass doesn't quite seem right.  The Stoli and Tonic I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  was great but again the glassware made for a short pour. When the check came, almost 22 dollars for the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> .  I don't care how high-end you are,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's absurd  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END> .   Continuing on with our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  fiasco we were moved from the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  where we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bottle of Panna for our flat  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> ...Always a good  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  when a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Service> serves <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , but as we came to find when the check came, 10 dollars was the going  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  liter of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . Did I mention the word absurd?!?  I don't know if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are trying to recoup  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  start up  <START:F_FI_Price> fees <END>  in 2 weeks but at this pace  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  just might!   Moving on to the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:S_Menu> choice <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   seemed to be a little bit more reasonable as we saw a bottle of the Raymond Cabernet  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  at 18 dollars a glass  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  would have ideally put the bottle at about 70 dollars, I say ideally because the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  didn't have a  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  by the bottle for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  ...I thought nothing of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  but was definitely ready to try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and get some  <START:Food> food <END>  in our tummies.... Things looked like  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were looking up!We then moved to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  promptly after  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and were met by our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .  No  <START:Offers> specials <END>  given  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  of the Thanksgiving Day Pre-Fix  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so we just  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  Dad started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>  on the Half Shell ($13.95.  Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and plenty of horseradish and  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to season! I wasn't so luck with my Baked Clams($13.95).  These little neck clams were 6 to the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  and just  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> ....LITTLE!  While the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  was decent, the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  could definitely use an adjustment. I also found  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a tad overwhelming  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  moved my clams from one  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  to the other and then  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  with the extra white  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  reduction.  Maybe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just me, but I don't like being  <START:Service> served <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . Sprinkle some  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END> , grate some  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  but no touching the  <START:Food> food <END> ...Well now to  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and good thing I was still hungry after the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  because the Prime Ribeye($45.95) I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   was massive.  The bone-in  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye was done perfectly medium with a Gorgonzola reduction I requested on the side.  Dad got the same with some sort of Au Jus...  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  Medium Rare and again perfectly done.  As a side we shared the German Potatoes(13.95) Kind of pricey for a side but good overall  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  After the  <START:Food> meal <END>  absolutely no  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  to try a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  so we asked for the check.  When  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came I opened  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and almost gave back  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  my  <START:Food> food <END> .  Not for  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  but the  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  on the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .  The Raymond Cabernet came out at $90.  I don't know who is doing the math in the accounting office but  you're definitely in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  for a raise! Long and the short of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  were phenomenal, Antonio the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was great but everything else was mediocre at best.  Too many  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  members running around and seemed like a lot of disorganization.
Beautiful  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . Love the text you when your  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  is ready.  But why does one go to a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at this  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> ? You want amazing  <START:Food> food <END> .   The  <START:Food> food <END>  is plentiful but nothing is great,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  blah, blah with a side of blah. Sure you get  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs(hot or chilled)  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  (too warm) dumplings ( <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  frozen),  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  (cardboard) prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  (no  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ) the rest is standard. Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , Mexican, Italian, Chinese, blah blah blah.  Nothing was out of the ordinary, interesting or gave me  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  WOW I thought I would have. If I'm  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  this  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  I want unique, non typical, amazing  <START:Food> food <END> . Mediocre doesn't cut  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Sorry Caesars,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  hype and no substance.$58 was the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  Sunday night.  <START:Service> service <END>  was top notch. $10 for tip total. $68 for one person.   $$$$
I was driving by when the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> attracted <END>  me to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  I totally dig this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a tiny stage  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hangs over the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with a great  <START:A_Entertainment> guitarist <END>  playing on this Friday night.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was unique and tasty.  I wasn't in a hurry and the pace of  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was relaxed so if your in a hurry do drive thru at Taco Bell.  But If your looking for an evening  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to take a  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  and you don't want break the bank this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great!
For some obscure reason, I start singing songs from 'Bambi' in my head when I think of 'Woodland Creatures'. I just wish the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  filled me with as much delight as Disney movies usually do!I was quite looking forward to  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a visit, as I'd heard lots of good things, and I finally got my chance one Saturday night. On first impressions, the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  have done a great job with the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , both inside & out, but I think I was expecting  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to be a wee bit quirkier (perhaps more woodlandy, a few more animals & maybe some unusual feature...like toilets hidden inside a tree  <START:A_Decor> themed <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  or something!).The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was well stocked,  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  were normal and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were friendly... <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just seemed to lack  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  for me. I'm having real difficulty putting my finger on the exact problem, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really did make me feel a bit 'meh' (or maybe some other creature related noise).I'd like to give Woodland Creatures another try so I can hopefully update my  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rating but, until then,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's only 2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for my night in the woods.
I don't understand the trend of celebrity  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  slapping  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  names on any  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> . This trend seems particularly prevalent in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> . Where is the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  control?Pub 1842 provides an average  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Everything is edible but not particularly memorable or delicious. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was fine. I will have to say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  we visited in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END>  includes Gordon Ramsay Pub, Mesa Grill, Spago, DOCG and others, the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  at Michael Mina Pub was the only one to refold my  <START:S_Cutlery> napkin <END>  when I left the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  have been trained  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .If you find yourself at MGM with no  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat, Michael Mina Pub would probably be fine. You'll leave feeling  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you overpaid, but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  happens almost  <START:A_Environment> everywhere <END>  in  <START:A_LocatedArea> vegas <END> .
" <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END> !  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END> !  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END> !" <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END>  are pretty much  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  my toddler would talk about today after our visit to Butterfly Wonderland.  I didn't really have expectations going in to check this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  out; I only knew  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were newly opened and had lots of  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END>  and a 3D butterfly movie.  I went with Alexa M (my sister-in-law) and my two kids (both under 2).  Luckily the kids were free because my adult ticket was $18.95 and Alexa's student ticket was $16.95... kind of pricey for what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is!We found  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  of the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  very friendly -- especially Myrna who took our tickets and gave us our 3D glasses upon entering.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  even gave my son an extra butterfly stamp on  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  hand since  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's kind of obsessed with both stamps and  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END> !  And while  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wouldn't sit still for the movie,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  absolutely loved seeing the  <START:A_Decor> butterflies <END>  in the atrium despite the humidity.   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  also loved the  <START:A_Decor> fountain <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  (both indoors and out).The  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  were satisfactory but overpriced.  Even so, this is a fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to visit with the kids or without.  If you're looking for an activity to eat up an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  or two max, and you have some extra $$ to spend, I do recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ... We actually ended up getting annual passes since my son liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so much.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  looks really cool. Too bad the  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  was not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  good 'Watery"....if you want to eat real Japanese  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  just go across the street to Zen  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> .
Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  yesterday and the Italian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was so good.  Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .
I had a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  Yesterday  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END> , jalapeño  <START:F_FoodItem> poppers <END>  and a couple of  kid  <START:Food> meals <END>  where whAt you would expect - good however, the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  especially good.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was kind and very prompt.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made sure our kids were taken care of and we never had to ask for  <START:Food> anything <END> .   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was wonderful.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was rewarded with a big compliment to the  <START:S_Staff> manger <END>  and a very generous tip. Thank you so much Vern. You are awesome!
I was actually kind of excited to visit this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , however my entire  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was negative. We came on a Sunday the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was kinda cool and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was pretty full. We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  immediately. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  looked like  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had something better to do and when I asked if I had  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't have  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> combo <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  didn't make the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Understandable. But  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attitude <END>  never changed. My boyfriend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and loved  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and then we decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pazookie <END> . Huge mistake. After 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  came and said the  <START:F_FoodItem> pazookie <END>  was dropped on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are getting a new one. We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  another 30  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  for our new one and when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  finally came we were excited to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Upon diving in we moved the  <START:F_Dessert>   ice     cream   <END>  over and seriously found a pubic hair in our  <START:F_FoodItem> pazookie <END>  between the I've  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> cookie <END> . Completely ruined our  <START:F_Appetizer> appetite <END> . Because of our overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  I will not be returning and would not recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to anybody looking for an uplifting  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat. Thumbs down.
My company moved into a new  <START:Ambience> building <END>  in Tempe yesterday and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> treated <END>  us to  <START:F_FoodItem> donuts <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  from Fractured Prune.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were fabulous.  Not your usual boring  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> .  Very innovative and tasty.  Loved the Bold  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  too.  I hadn't heard of  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  before - but now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I have, I'll go back on my own.
let a tip. check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out. this is my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  using Yelp and thought I was writing a review.
I have been to the Waterworks Burgatory as well as the spot at Consol Arena and the  <START:Food> food <END>  truck at Mario's Livingroom. I have enjoyed  <START:Restaurant> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> . So, when  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  opened in the Waterfront, I was very excited. As a Waterfront "local", I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for a while before venturing over  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . New  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  openings  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  always attract a huge crowd. Today, my husband and I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  at noon.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was busy but the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  was only 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . I gave my cell number to the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  and even though I got a text to see the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  because my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was ready,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't ready when I went inside. We had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> them <END>  to clear and wipe the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  before being  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> . My brother had recommended the Espresso Love  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END> . I've had  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  hard  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  before, so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  and so did my husband. The  <START:F_Drinks> tequila <END>  in the  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  were overpowering. Never before have I had a Burgatory hard  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  where the  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  was so overwhelming. Even the man at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  next to us made mention of the same thing. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  who took our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was very nice, but one  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  brought us our  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  and a completely different  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  brought us our  <START:Food> meals <END> . I hope  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  tip share because other than taking our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and taking away our empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and things,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  did little else. The  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  of today was a  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  on top. My husband  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  and said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:F_FI_Quality> dryest <END>  thing  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had ever  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  made comparisons to the Sahara and the Gobi when describing this   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I did a Create your Own  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>    <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with provolone,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  and a sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  rub on the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . I have to cut most  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  in half and when I cut this in half,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just oozed greasy. The bottom of the  <START:F_Ingredients> wheat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  was saturated with greasy  <START:F_Drinks> juices <END> . Also,  <START:Restaurant> their <END>  assembly of the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  goes against  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  conventional thinking  <START:F_FoodItem> which <END> , in this case, was NOT a good thing.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  put the cold  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  against the hot provolone  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , then the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and then put the sauteed  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  on top of the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  so  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  fell out  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Whoever cleared this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  to be  <START:Service> served <END>  was NOT  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  attention or doesn't know what  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are looking at as my  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  over the basket before I even laid eyes on my  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . The sea  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  and herb  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  needs to drop the herbs.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't suit the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't suit  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  clash. I had to use a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  to cover the herb  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . I might come back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if i'm just going to have a short  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> , but not for a full  <START:Food> meal <END> . I was sadly disappointed with Burgatory after  <START:F_FoodItem> all <END>  my great previous  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  with  <START:F_Drinks> them <END> . I know  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  will get my business when I go to a Pens  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> .
Man, I love Babystacks! The Summerlin  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  was created such a great vibe, I was really putting some big expectations on this new  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . The best part:  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's literally a mile away from my  <START:A_Places> house <END> !  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's a score!Just like the first  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is busy! On the weekends (and probably the weekdays as well) be prepared to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ! My  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  wasn't bad though, just 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>   <START:A_Places> station <END>  with some  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  and lots of standing  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . When you enter the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , you'll notice lots of  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  top  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  and some  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's big  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tvs <END>  for the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and some  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  top  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  as well. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was awesome. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was such a sweet lady.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  us within 2  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and kept checking back with us. We actually got our  <START:Food> food <END>  before the guests  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sat 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before we did! Now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's efficient :)For  <START:Food> brunch <END> , I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> spam <END>  Scramble for $7.95. Three scrambled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  with diced  <START:F_FoodItem> spam <END> , sprinkled with  <START:F_Ingredients> furikake <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  upgrade for $1.00 more. The  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> furikake <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were awesome! I love  <START:F_FoodItem> spam <END>  and love the  <START:F_FI_Taste> saltiness <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , complimenting the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  very nicely. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was on point, just as I remembered. The ONLY problem with this  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  was the  <START:A_Places> portion <END> . OMG,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was sooo small!  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took up only 75% of the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> . I ate everything within 2  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END> . I definitely think  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have bigger  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  in the Summerlin  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . For my side, I decided to upgrade with a babystack of Red Velvet. Red velvet  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> , topped with whipped  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  crumbles,  <START:Service> served <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  syrup. OH-EM-GEE, just has I remembered! The  <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END>  were moist and so  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorful <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  really made the red  <START:F_FoodItem> velvet pop <END>  out and the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  crumbles accented the  <START:Food> dish <END>  very well. DEFINITELY A MUST TRY!I'm so glad this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  opened by my  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I can literally come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  every weekend without wasting a lot of gas. The next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I come, though, I hope  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  address this  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> issue <END> . Whether or not, I'm still coming back... <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  again!

 <START:Food> really good <END>   <START:Food> stuff <END> !! The  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> ! I loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and when I am back  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the old USA I can only hope I will cross paths with another culvers.You know what the thing is with culvers? You actually don't need  <START:Food> that <END>  much,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's sort of like eating  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>  or  <START:F_Appetizer> cookie <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> dough <END> . You can only have so much before you start getting  <START:Food> that <END>  sickly feeling and start stirring  <START:Food> that <END>  plastic  <START:Food> spoon <END>  around and staring down the  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  and wondering why you dont wanna finish. Yeah  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's heavy especially when you add every kind of peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chocholate <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to the mix.Let me tell you those first five spoonfuls are pure goodness then  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  goes downhill. Less is more with this  <START:Food> stuff <END>  let me tell you! Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I am getting the smallest  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> , and I will be far more pleased and not guilty I threw out a mega  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>   <START:Food> bucket <END> . Hahaha!
Mr. Roberts is not a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I'd ever go to for the sole purpose of going out. Both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I've gone have been for  <START:A_Ent_Music> bands <END> , and both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  were fairly different  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END> .My first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was a one- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> :  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ridiculously hot and humid inside, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  lacked any sort of motivation for good customer  <START:Service> service <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  crammed the 7- or 8-piece  <START:A_Ent_Music> band <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the front of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  near the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> , making for awkward  <START:A_OutsideView> viewing <END>  and playing. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> sound <END>  was terrible and I spent more  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  than  <START:Restaurant> in <END> . My second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was a better  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , but still not one  <START:Food> that <END>  would cause me to suggest other  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . This  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  around  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a reasonable  <START:A_Env_Type> temperature <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but  <START:Food> that <END>  may only be due to the fact  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the 50s  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . The  <START:A_Ent_Music> bands <END>  played  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the back of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  an alcove/side  <START:A_Places> room <END>  deal and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  made a lot more sense. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> sound <END>  was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad.  <START:Offers> free <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  is the best thing (only thing?) Mr. Roberts has going for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  biggest downsides:-  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's touted as a blue-collar  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's more an excuse to be shabby and dirty than  <START:Food> anything <END> ; $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END>  for a  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> -bottle  <START:Food> bucket <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is not a good deal, and $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>  for a PBR & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  should be the standard  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  for such a combination- the ladies  <START:A_Places> room <END>  is ridiculously tiny and awkward, had a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  was half hanging off the bowl, and no TP- every  <START:A_Environment> surface <END>  was dirty or sticky, yuckYou probably won't die if you go to see a friend's  <START:A_Ent_Music> band <END>  play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside.
I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a handful of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  over the years for dinner.  Had no clue  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had a weekend brunch  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I think I was the only one  <START:Food> that <END>    <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  off the regular  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  our group.  Based on comments  <START:S_Staff> no one <END>  went away unhappy with their  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> .  Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  had never worked opening shift before but did a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Service> job <END> .  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is getting a little worn but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  fits.  I am sure I'll end up  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.
NO NO NO, this  <START:Restaurant> placemakes <END>  Panda Express seem gourmet. Garbage  <START:Food> food <END> !
I have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice on a whim. The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I ate my  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty decent. The second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I placed an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to go and unfortunately I should have checked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before I left. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was dripping  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> . Not sure what  <START:Food> that <END>  was all about but I was so disappointed. Did I eat any of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , yes because I was hungry however  <START:Food> that <END>  was a mistake as I felt sick to my stomach later  <START:Food> that <END>  day. I will give the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  another try  one day as maybe the cook was having an off morning. Like I said before, when I ate at the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  the  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, but take out, make sure you check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before you leave so  <START:Food> that <END>  you don't end up with a box of  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> . Blech
My  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was probably one of the worst I've ever had. My friends and I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for a Suns  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  near the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> . As we were sitting  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , a girl who was  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , looked above our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and saw a cockroach crawling right over our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . Now granted, I have a phobia of bugs, and especially roaches, but this seems to me, like a pretty big deal. After the initial scare, I informed our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  of this and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  freaked out for a second, and ran off to tell someone.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  didnt return for another  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , though  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was only to bring  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I then told the  <START:S_Staff> host <END>  near the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  exclaimed  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was horrible and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  walked away(apparently to get someone?). After another 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  still nothing happened so I found the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  again and told him nothing has been done yet. By this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , the others at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  had gotten their  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  told me  <START:Food> that <END>  since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so high on the ceiling  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no way for him to get to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Now, I'm no engineer, or trained exterminator, but I had about 2-3 different ideas on how to get to the roach. I didnt realize  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was stumped. I felt like I should make a bigger deal about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but instead I left. I don't feel like anyone should be forced to eat  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  those conditions, without at least an attempt to rectify  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I mean, I dont have any delusions about spic and span  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> . I know  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  are dirty, but to have a roach hanging over our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  is unacceptable. And the only reason the  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  would do nothing is because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would have made a scene. I guarantee you if  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  had seen  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  or was  <START:O_Experience> experiencing <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> , SOMETHING would have been done. For us to have to endure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  because no else was being affected is basically saying we dont matter enough for  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  to do  <START:Food> anything <END> . How was the  <START:Food> food <END>  you ask? I didnt even see  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  since I was focusing on the large roach hanging over my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .
Amazing  <START:Service> service <END>  from Jelly for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today, and seriously good  <START:Food> food <END> !  A wonderful hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with heat and a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pico <END>  start things before you even get to sample the tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> .  Highly recommended.
My co-worker and I literally didn't know what we wanted for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and were just about to put names of  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  to draw...but when we wrote down TGIF...well... <START:Food> lunch <END>  fell into  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for us! Lol! So when we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had a banner  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  advertising a  <START:Offers> 2 for 10.99 <END>  on a half rack of BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ...i made my mind up before I walked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> !  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  actually give you a separate sheet of paper for their  <START:Offers> 2 for 10.99 <END>   <START:Offers> offers <END>  so I guess you HAVE to ask  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  or you'll never even know  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  exists! I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> garlic <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> tomato <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> basil <END> (?)  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> ) and my  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ...DeEELiCiOuS!!!  <START:Food> that <END>  Jack Daniels BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is something else! The  <START:Food> entree <END>  comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and cole  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END> ...I asked if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  could replace  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with a  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  pilaf or something but  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Offers> 2 for 10.99 <END>  won't allow  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  I guess :( ...but the  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END>  was surprising okay!  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has green  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> ...kinda reminded me of the inside of a  <START:F_FoodItem>   fish     taco   <END>  minus the  <START:F_Ingredients> fish <END> ! Lol! We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a whiskey caramel  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  a la mode...idk what  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's called....but  <START:Food> that <END>  was TO DIE FOR!!! decadent and not super sweet perfect blend of flavors!  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  way to end the  <START:Food> meal <END> !...AND...you get $2 off  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  at  <START:Food> lunch <END> ! :) I love a  <START:Offers> discount <END> !The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was awesome! Super attentive...definitely will go back for more! :)
Always wanted to stop by, just never did till today. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is much larger on the inside then  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looks. The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is impressive and not over the top. Two full  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> pool <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and plenty of  <START:A_Places> room <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  to relax while you play. Two digital dart  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  as well.I was disappointed  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the fact  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't have a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  so no  <START:Food> food <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  stated  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  may be getting  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back soon, so I will definately  <START:O_Experience> be back <END>  to check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out again.
As other reviewers stated,  <START:Service> service <END>  is spotty (polite, but mostly absent, which is strange  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  this  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> ).   <START:Food> food <END>  is good:  <START:F_FoodItem> omelets <END>  are LARGE - clearly can be split by 2 regular  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  folks.  Well prepared and full of good  <START:Food> stuff <END> .  Our sides of the banana  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  were clearly warmed over which was a little embarrassing for the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  (who danced around the subject)  But the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  course, which was the reason for visiting, hit the mark.Not easy to get  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  and out of since you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  at the register ( <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  during our visit turned into a 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  ordeal -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  happens).  But, as Yelp says, A-OK.
My favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  EVER! I no  <START:W_Waiting> longer <END>  live  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Madison but every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I visit, I make sure  <START:Food> that <END>  I stop  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is too-di- for, the  <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and-- espeicially after their remodel  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the last year--the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is classy but casual. I really can't say enough goo things about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , you won't regret  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !
I have been going to this  <START:Restaurant> deli <END>  for many years.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has changed  <START:A_LocatedArea> locations <END>  and chaged  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  never lost  <START:Food> anything <END>  along the way. I would say  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  got better as the years have gone on. By far the best  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  baked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  house everyday. Every party or  get-together i have or go to I will always stop  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and grad some  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have Boars Head  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  which is the best  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  Italian sausage  <START:Food> that <END>  comes  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  from Chicago.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have take home  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  kits.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  include the  <START:F_Ingredients> dough <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and  <START:F_Ingredients> peperoni <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are good! Check this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  out if your  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  going out of your way to get.
Fantastic thin  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  with the best  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  cooked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a coal fired oven.  <START:Service> service <END>  was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I kind of stuffed myself full of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  slices- but hey I rarely get  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  so this was my  <START:Service> treat <END>  and I won't be ashamed of myself f I break my scale tomorrow ah!
I went  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were a step above del  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were still ok.  Not 9 bucks ok, but ok.My  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  was never empty, and my  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> (es) were very nice. <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was slow and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Env_AC> cold <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> , I felt sorry for  <START:S_Staff> them <END> .Also, the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  drowned out the bible thumping street preacher screaming  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> .  I wanted to invite him  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  for a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and to tempt himself to think of the sins of the flesh.  Poor  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  looked like  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  could use  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  Wound up  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  all  <START:Food> that <END>  rage... when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and women 10 feet away.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a total  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Dive!  I dig; this is my  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's generally pretty quiet and I can actually hear what you're saying.  I enjoy getting small  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  along with my  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .  Reverse every Friday - Sunday!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is pretty good - I wouldn't say  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the best but edible.   <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  -  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is always friendly and down to earth.  The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is pretty cool - modern Japanese style.  This is my "No Significant Other"  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  - yes so if you're hanging with me and we're going to Crazy  <START:F_Ingredients> fish <END>  you best not bring your partner - you'll get slapped!  Haha - really!  - Enjoy!
THE BEST Mongolian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  anywhere! Yum!
Amazing since the late nineties. Still is  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  2013.
Absolute worse. I would never stay  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again. Went on vacation with a friend  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was piss poor, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was all over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and when we first got to our  <START:A_Places> room <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  still had filth  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> . We received no basic amenities and received all around bad  <START:Service> service <END>  with this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Never again!
I am utterly addicted to their  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is fantastic, and the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are very polite and professional. I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to death.
Ok, if you have no other options. I work graveyard, and this is one of the only  <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivers <END>  near me overnight.  Their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is ok, NY style.  But, aside from their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , I'd advise to stay away.  I don't think  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a single  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  anywhere to be found.  <START:Food> that <END>  includes their  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .    <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not too hard to throw a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast on a flat grill, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  insists on using pre-cooked  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:Food> items <END> .. And you can really tell.   All of their  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  are frozen, and fried.If this is your last ditch resort, then go ahead.. But if you have other options, exercise  <START:S_Staff> them <END> !
This review is just about the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , not the  <START:Service> service <END>  or  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , as I have only  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  delivery from this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  just isn't  <START:Food> that <END>  good.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have some  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>  combinations  <START:Food> that <END>  are interesting, but I've found  <START:Food> that <END>  most of  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  just miss the mark.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  end up being  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  heavy or  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>  heavy without much  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  or balance. Their  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are primarily watery iceberg  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  with a few  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  thrown  <START:Restaurant> in <END> . Their  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  dressings are bagged and uninspired. I agree  <START:Food> that <END>  the Mediterranean  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is their best, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  probably the only thing I would eat if I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again.
Ok, so is this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  1- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  or  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> ?¿?  Stopped  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  today just after 11 AM for a first visit, to find out.  The first thing I noticed was all the $100k+ cars  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot!  Somehow  <START:Food> that <END>  didn't seem to go with an old Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !  The next surprise was  <START:Food> that <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was already getting busy!   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  DO have a loyal, moneyed clientele, for whatever reason!Ok, so I stepped inside.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's an oddball  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Places> room <END>  as well as a regular dining  <START:A_Places> room <END>  and an  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> .  The whole  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  struck me as pretty boozy, but credit  <START:Food> that <END>  at least  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  part due to the fact  <START:Food> that <END>  all of the other customers seemed to be having  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  (for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> ?).  Uck.  So anyway, I ate  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the regular dining  <START:A_Places> room <END> , within which I wasn't completely comfortable.  I'm picky about  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  &  <START:A_Decor> lighting <END>  & I just didn't end up with a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  I liked.The  <START:Food> food <END> :  Shortly after I was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> , a big bowl of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  & a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of fairly hot chunky style  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  arrived.  Both were delicious, & a second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  was cheerfully provided.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 2-Item Combo, with a Nana's [Chile] Relleno and a Machaca (shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , hard shell)  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END> .Before long my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  landed on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , attractively placed on a piping hot platter.  The Relleno was unusual  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't  <START:F_FoodItem> breaded <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a medium  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END> , medium hot Pablano, stuffed with Oaxaca  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  & topped with a little Ranchero or Cotija.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  was big, tasty, & had a good amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .  Both the refried  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  & the Spanish  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  were super good, &  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a bed of shredded  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  to mop up the platter with.For me, this was a 4- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Service> served <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  2- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  comfort.  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  was near the high end at $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 10.50 <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_Places> portions <END>  were excellent and so was the  <START:Service> service <END> .     :-)
Are we even talking about this?!?! This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  blows my mind every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Those  <START:F_Ingredients> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  are a steal at twice the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . For a truly incomparable  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for dinner.
Walked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  on a sunday night without  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and had an AWESOME  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> !  ( we we're not  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  but sitting right at a huge open  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  with a mostly unobstructed  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the bellagio fountains)the  <START:Service> service <END>  was awesome - the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , always had a smile and always realllly attentive, I loved  <START:Food> that <END> !The  <START:Food> food <END>  :  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a mere " Meh!"  Although, i would like to come back and try something else. I had a New York  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END>  - didnt really like the crispy  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were  <START:Service> served <END>  with, the macaronni  <START:F_FoodItem> gratin <END>  was way too rich, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like a shoe!! I think theses  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  rely too much on their "  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> " and dont really give much thought to the actual   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .Thankfully, i ate almost a whole  <START:F_Appetizer> baghette <END>  before the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  came so i was satisfied!! lol. Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I visit this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  will be for   <START:Food> lunch <END>  , and ill try a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwhich <END> . 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for the  <START:Service> service <END> , the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END> ! definitely will be coming back...
Our last  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas and we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . We sat on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> in <END>  January!) and had the best  <START:Food> meal <END>  we've had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>  days we were  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Perfectly cooked filet  <START:F_Ingredients> mignon <END>  with Merlot  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and good little French " <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> ".  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  gluten  <START:Offers> free <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , a gluten  <START:Offers> free <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> , and special  <START:F_FI_Healthy> allergy <END>  tags for  <START:Food> food <END> .
Hubby and I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and their version of mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was so delicious as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was bursting with wonderful  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The shiitake  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  were amazing!  The mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  was just ok.  I initially  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of white  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , but decided a few sips later  <START:Food> that <END>  I needed a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of Pinot Noir to pair with my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  instead.  Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  gladly obliged with my request.  I wish I can dock off half a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  because of the  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  take of you at your  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  A lady with a camera came to us and asked if we wanted a  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> .  Thinking  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be like Morton's, a complimentary  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  of us  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a little cardboard  <START:S_Gift> frame <END>  folder.  The lady came back out with a  <START:A_Furniture> leather <END>   <START:S_Gift> frame <END>  folder, about 11x13" or so, with two of our  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END>  enclosed.  Granted, we didn't like how we looked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:S_Staff> them <END> , then  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  threw the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  at us of $60.  Heck no!  I'm not  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  much for dinner  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  we don't even like.  We're not obligated to buy  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  made me feel bad because the poor lady went through all  <START:Food> that <END> .
I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  yesterday for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with friends. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good, as usual (I had  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>  and my fiance had an alfredo  <START:Food> dish <END> , which  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said wasn't  <START:Food> that <END>  good) but this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the  <START:Service> service <END>  wasn't as superb. My fiance's silverware was dirty, and my Pepsi  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  flat. I ended up just drinking  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . Our initial  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  mysteriously disappeared after getting our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ... another  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  took over and said  <START:Food> that <END>  the other  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  had to "take off." This was kind of confusing, because we saw  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:S_Staff> waitressing <END>  other  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  right by us. Plus, I never like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are about  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>  different  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  stopping by your  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . One  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  asked if we wanted more  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , and we said yes, and then  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  never brought the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  basket back. Different  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  brought out our  <START:Food> dishes <END> ... and, nearing the end our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  kept asking us if we needed  <START:Food> anything <END>  (we were just sitting  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  talking), which made us feel like  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  wanted us to leave. I think we would have understood this had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  been extremely busy and a long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was hardly anyone  <START:Restaurant> there <END> !
I used to hate Carly's.  I couldn't see the appeal.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is always abysmally slow.  The seasonal tap is always empty - half the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  don't even know what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is supposed to be filled with.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is... okay.  A few of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are  <START:Food> really good <END> , but the  <START:Food> vegetarian <END>  and vegan options are pretty  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END>  - when I started eating  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  again, I started liking the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a lot more.The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has grown on me the past couple years, though.   <START:Restaurant> they <END> 've started hiring some pretty good  <START:A_Ent_Music> musicians <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  has been stepped up a little bit.  Unlike the Lost Leaf or Roosevelt, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is big enough to accommodate a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  without making conversation impossible.I guess I now feel  <START:Food> that <END>  Carly's is A-OK.  Accept the fact  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  aren't trying particularly hard, and you'll be able to enjoy the convenience and relatively low  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all.
Best spot  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the house,  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  AND  <START:Restaurant> shops <END> / <START:A_Decor> themed <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> . Problem was the  <START:Food> food <END>  was quite aweful. French  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , the filet  <START:F_FoodItem> migon <END>  and even  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  was bad. The only had one seasoning, lots and lots and lots of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .
What a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ! Definitely coming back & bringing friends next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Between the constant  <START:Service> service <END> , deliciously full flavored  <START:Food> meals <END>  & the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has officially ranked on to my Top 10 List!
Amazing and a top of must do list  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas!Reserve for a half our before sunset and enjoy the ride... Much better than the High Roller.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  accommodated our group of 8 with special birthday requests and beyond. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the tasting  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was superb! Seared  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and Fillet  2 inches thick, medium rare and perfect.  <START:Service> service <END>  was spot on and the  <START:A_OutsideView> exterior <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> entertainment <END>  was steady.  We will eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on our next visit.
 <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was good, prompt and friendly. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:Offers> offers <END>  your typical American  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  fare at a  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  which is average for Vegas but more expensive  <START:Food> that <END>  anywhere else  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the USA. We had the  <START:F_Ingredients> corned <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  hash with poached  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> . Nice. However  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  over from us had to send their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  back because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was gristly.I was tossing up to give this 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . But the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  thing  <START:Food> that <END>  let  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  down was the $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 3.75 <END>  charge for brewed  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> .  The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was just terrible and I resented  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  at any  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> .
OK so I am a picky eater who tends to lean towards  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  While  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas for the weekend, my BF and I decided to try Nove Italiano mainly bc we wanted a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with a nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and a nice  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> .We figured, "OK Italian,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  will probably be pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary"Were we wrong.This  <START:Food> food <END>  was unbelievable. <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the beginning  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  bring you an assortment of  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> breads <END>  and breadsticks with a little tray on the side with  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  Oil, Red  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  Flakes and  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  for dipping. I dont usually partake  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , but I did try a thin  <START:F_Ingredients> breadstick <END>  with the dippings and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Food> really good <END> .After reading about the Grilled Octopus App on yelp, I figured we had to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   Let me tell you,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was amazing.   Obviously not for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  bc  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  octopus, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so tender and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> marinade <END>  was simple but very very  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  and a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were grilled so  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were crispy.  Like nothing I have ever had before.The  <START:F_FoodItem> marinade <END>  was not too heavy, more like a ton of  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> herbs <END> .I had the White  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> clams <END> .Very simple but amazing.Extremely thin  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  so you can eat  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and not feel full or guilty.  And big  <START:F_FoodItem> clams <END>  and plenty of  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  on top.My BF got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Marsala.    <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was on the bone which at first seemed weird, but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  bc  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  fell off the bone.Huge gourmet  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  and plenty of  <START:S_Staff> them <END> .On the side  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had penne  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Alfredo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  which  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  loved.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END> -made  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and a bit lighter then what you would expect alfredo to be.We got a side of the Aparagus special  <START:Food> dish <END> , which was Grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  with an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  and Ricotta  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .Sounds totally weird, I know, but so  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> !!The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is also swanky and upscale but comfortable, the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .Overall this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a Must when  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas.And the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  ,we thought, was very fair.  We more than enough  <START:Food> food <END> , and 1  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and a Diet  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END>  and the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  was $125 with  <START:O_Payment> tip <END> .     Not bad at all for a fine  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas.
Ok,  <START:Food> buffet <END>  but not outstanding.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was easy  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  and easy out, but the  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  seemes somewhat limited.  My wife did not like the freshness or the the seasoning of the   <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  Probably a good  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  with coupon for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  or  <START:Food> lunch <END> , but you can do better.
The only thing worse than their mediocre  <START:Food> food <END>  turns out to be their completely rude and condescending  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I have given Ken's more business than  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  ever deserved over the past couple of years solely due to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  proximity to home and work. The  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  I had  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last weekend will certainly be my last.  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the past I had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  things which didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END> , one particular  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  Uni (sea urchin), a favorite of mine. I will forego any comparisons  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  for the sake of the weary, but let's just say  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was horrible. So, I politely sent  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back, only to be told when the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  returned  <START:Food> that <END>  Uni was not  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  season.... So, I should naturally know this? Hmmm... How about you just apologize and not blame the customer for foolishly eating what you  <START:Service> served <END> ??The  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  this past weekend was very similar, the spicy Yellowtail  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had been left  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Tupperware  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the sun for a day or two, so I politely sent  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. I was told  <START:Food> that <END>  perhaps Yellowtail isn't my  <START:F_Ingredients> fish <END> , as though I had never had a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  before  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  my life.Apparently at Ken's, the customer is always wrong. Be warned, go elsewhere, like  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Eye or one of several others  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  who  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  without insult.
As  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to a nice night out as you can find  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  CU.The  <START:Food> food <END> 's always been solid, the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  good and the  <START:Service> service <END>  ok.However,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  does get VERY noisy during the dinner hour.  While  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  may not be a true  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> , for CU  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  deserves  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .By the way, why does a city with such a strong  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  population have such a terrible  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  scene??  Will  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ever be any NICE  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ?
The  <START:Food> food <END>  takes forever to be  <START:Service> served <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  on the side never come and most of the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  you need to ask for  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  again.The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is rude, especially at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  a couple of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  cuz  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  really  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to home. Never went home satisfied.
 <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , Excellent  <START:Service> service <END> !
Good  <START:Food> food <END>  sadly  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  have reduced as  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  as gone by, love their Mongolian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , ok  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , sadly not the best I've had.
Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is lacking. I tried the Santa Fe  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END>  and found  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  to be not very spicy. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and I will go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again because  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to where I live. However, I would like a little more  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ...
This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  has a hip and modern vibe, reminds me of the W  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  or aLoft  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> . I like how  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are sofas  <START:Food> that <END>  invite you to sit and chat, and how  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  transformed the  <START:A_Places> space <END>  between Switch and Schlotzsky's into a little  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> .Why you should eat at Switch:-Unique options (everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  looks good -  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many different kinds of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> !)- <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . I got the Dragon Pita and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was really delicious. On the downside, I had to eat  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with a  <START:S_Cutlery> fork <END>  and a  <START:S_Cutlery> knife <END>  because the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was dripping all over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't give us any paper  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> .-Freshness. Although $10 seems a bit much for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was justified when our  <START:Food> food <END>  came. All the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  and high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , and the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are appropriate. Even the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:Food> really good <END> !Why I don't give Switch  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> :-Slow  <START:Service> service <END> . We were sitting for about 8  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came to ask what we wanted to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for our  <START:Food> food <END>  seemed like forever (c'mon, how long does  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  take to make a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ?). Or maybe I'm just used to Subway. Strangely though, our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was amazingly quick to take away our  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and bring the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . hmm.-The  <START:A_Decor> lighting <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was way too dark,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was actually darker inside than  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . This may be personal preference, and of course  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  during the daytime for  <START:Food> lunch <END> , and not dinner.-Consistency. Whereas the Dragon Pita was delicious, the Lobster  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was pretty ordinary. If you don't know what will turn out good, I'd advise choosing something with a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of eclectic  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> .Finally, this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  seems to be targeted more towards the 20-35 year old age group. I wouldn't advise coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with children or your parents... unless you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  take-out.
I'll sacrifice a lot for a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  Factory you get both  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  and sacrifices. The slow-as-molasses  <START:Service> service <END>  and often-dirty  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> : no biggie, since the  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  I get  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  comes covered  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lox <END>  spread and is chewy and boiled to true  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  perfection. So far, once of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  I've had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the 'burgh.
My  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  told me how amazing Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was, and I kept writing  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  off.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a generic  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Inside a  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .  Pass.  But then I found myself at Planet Hollywood and a friend of mine was hungry, so I told him to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  ate a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and was surprised how good  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was, too.Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I found myself at the PH, I made a point to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  The Original  <START:F_FoodItem> 1762 <END> , which is a roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with horseradish  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just as good as  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  have been saying.  Just a tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  for a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> , especially as we were on the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> .  I'm not going to drive down just to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but I will try to snag this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  again if I'm  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> .
My friend who came to visit me several months ago ( <START:Restaurant> in <END>  tandem with  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  step-mother, who came for a work convention) attended a corporate conference dinner at this joint, and donated  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:Food> leftovers <END>  to me, which were oh-so-delicious as I was working two jobs at the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> they <END> 'd been sitting  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the fridge for several hours.   <START:Food> that <END> 's why I decided to give Lucille's a go when I was looking for a dinner spot with a friend of mine a couple of weeks ago.  What a difference the lack of desperation makes.  Lucille's was basically an overly- <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  conditioned gigantic disappointment, with a hyperattentive young  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  who did  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  best, gosh darnit.  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  were high, to say the least, which is why my friend and I chose to share our  <START:Food> meal <END> , a full rack of  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ... with an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  of fried green  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  (for the kitsch factor, of course.)  I'll just lay  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  was terrible. The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  had practically no  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> them <END> , and I felt like I was just gnawing on sinewy bones for like ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was gross to attempt, and probably worse to watch. The side  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  was equally  <START:F_FoodItem> vile <END> , and I don't know how you even mess  <START:Food> that <END>  up. The whole  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was awkward, our conversation was continually interrupted by the enthusiastic little  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just so damn  <START:A_Env_AC> cold <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  we felt like we were being refrigerated.  I will admit  <START:Food> that <END>  we both enjoyed the fried green  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just isn't enough to save this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  well-earned one  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  review.  To over-charge so horribly for the sorry excuse for  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> served <END> ?  To subject their guests to the hokey "down-home" manufactured  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might as well be an Applebee's? I don't know.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just all too much for me. When all was said and done, we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  over 40 bucks for this totally subpar  <START:Food> meal <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just weird.  I'm sure my out-of- <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END>  friend had a better  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  stepmom's corporate shindig... but then again,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were all drunk.  I'll make sure I'm good and sauced prior to my next visit to Lucille's... because  <START:Food> that <END> 's the only way I could be convinced to return.
This Gordon Biersch is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> ! The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  Eddy is why this is my favorite  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  is always on point and you can tell runs the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  well
Had  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  Saturday morning.   The  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was super friendly and attentive.   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was very good.  My problem is the  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  per se.  Never been a big fan of the " <START:A_Places> space <END> " itself, when  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> jams <END>  before.  Like a  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  garage  <START:Food> that <END>  has been  <START:A_Decor> painted yellow <END> .  Acoustics are horribly loud...and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  weren't too many  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  when we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  If  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were more kids....would be very loud.  The counter looks very uncomfortable..... <START:Restaurant> its <END>   <START:A_Decor> design <END>  doesn't allow for legroom...what is with  <START:Food> that <END> ?   <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  were very present and hands on.   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  seemed very happy.If you like the sort of  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END>   <START:Ambience> ambience <END> ....this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for you.
YES.  This was exactly what I needed.   <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  I go to is a marvel  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  efficiency and obviously the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  is right.  Make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a double and get a  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  You can't go wrong.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is so tasty!  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is knowledgeable as well. I will definitely  <START:O_Experience> be back <END> . Many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> 
Sushisamba continues to be my "go to" spot when I am staying  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the Palazzo.  Good,  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  are personable and welcoming always make my evenings  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a good one.On this visit, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the king  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  leg.  At $25  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems like a splurge, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was huge, meaty and absolutely delicious! <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  and tasty and even my grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  was perfect.If you are not staying  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> - know  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is on the 2nd level of the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  along with plenty of other  <START:Restaurant> shops <END> !Always a good  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> !
Either I am just easy to please or have been getting damn lucky on the  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  I have been spending my  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END>  at. Anyhoo, I went to Maizie's last night for $3  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  night, best 3 bucks I have ever spent on a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ! First off though when we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seemed like we would have a bit of a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , not so!  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  less than 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  which was awesome because I was starving. For an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  dip, so freaking delish I could have eaten another! I had bacon and  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  jack  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  added to my  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was so filling I could only eat half. My  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  this morning, the other half! Tastes  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  heated up too. For my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  I had  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  which was perfect, not to sweet, not to sour. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was attentive and the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  watching was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> . This wasn't my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at Maizie's and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  won't be my last either.
Although  <START:Service> service <END>  was good, my  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was seriously  <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down. To the point of me almost saying, can I just get a  <START:F_Drinks> rum <END>  on the rocks? Seriously. Basically I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $12 total for two  <START:F_Drinks> cokes <END>  with a splash of  <START:F_Drinks> rum <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  reminded me of hearing Kat Williams say, if your  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  is really, really dark like blood,  <START:Food> that <END>  is because you didn't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  buddy so sit your broke A$$ down. I actually  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for some  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  and got none.. I am not asking you to pour like I am  <START:F_Ingredients> fish <END> , but man, can you add a little bit of spirits to my  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> ?  <START:Food> that <END>  would be lovely, thanks!  I wasn't the only one with this issue as another member of our party complained about the exact same thing.
Over a short period of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has gone to the  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END> .  Napoleons and other  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  cream  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END>  are now frozen as a matter of course.  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  selection is poor and badly made  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is accepted. Hipsters seem to accept the off hand  <START:Service> service <END>  and lack of attention to detail as a badge of honor. Sadly the hype has done Amelie's a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  disservice. I hope  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  can remedy  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  I used to love the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Went to Stratta to watch the Super Bowl.  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $75 for a three course  <START:Food> meal <END> , 2 well  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or a pitcher of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  front of the TVs. If you ever want to watch the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas, I highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the best  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  we could have made for the weekend. Totally  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> ! The  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  of buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and calamari were the perfect football watching  <START:Food> food <END> .... and large enough for us to share. For the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> , I had the rigatoni and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  and the wife had the  <START:F_FoodItem> linguine <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  clam  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Both solid. For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came with the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream. The  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream was the "worst" thing we had  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was just eh... but the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  and rich.The  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  and provided awesome  <START:Service> service <END> . I don't know if I'd  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  during a regular trip to LV, but for the Super Bowl, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is on top of my list.
Seriously?Cheap 'Vietnamese'  <START:Food> food <END>  with a Plateau  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  tag. My friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Pad Thai, and then remembered  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  needed to ask about any  <START:F_Ingredients> nuts <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  due to an  <START:F_FI_Healthy> allergy <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  just brought us out the jar of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , complete with  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  tag of $2.99.  Maybe lots of  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  do this, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's pretty disappointing.  I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> lemongrass <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just like any other miscellaneous asian stir fry with the same mix of  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a fairly good  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> .  I haven't had their  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> , so maybe  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are amazing, and the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was ok, but everything else on their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is basically  <START:F_FoodItem> veg mix <END>  +  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  + (jar?)  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END> .95+tax gets you  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and spring  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  or  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  This is definitely not Schezuan.Also, strangely enough: we had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  on a Saturday and were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  right away but the same 3 groups of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  were  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  from the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we arrived and throughout our entire  <START:Food> meal <END>  even though we were sitting  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  facing three empty  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ? So, make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> , I suppose.
Went for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very busy because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's Sunday afternoon. My  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  but had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for someone to clean off the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . Otherwise this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is always nice and clean.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a fast good fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  option, much better than the other corporate spots.Pros:Spicy cajun style breading.Good  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  combo options.Grey  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END> :Gravy seems to be out of a bag or from powder. <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  seems to be pre-made too.Cons: <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  give you are kirkland dinner  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  just warm  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  under a heat lamp.  Can't stand bogus  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , or at least don't let me see you pulling  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  out of a kirkland package.Also,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems  <START:Food> that <END>  their is a moderate probability  <START:Food> that <END>  if you go  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  when  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's slow, you might get  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  has been sunbathing under said heatlamps for hours.If I need fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , I definitely consider this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ; however,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not the best and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not the worst.  The value is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  and the fixin's adequately fill their role... you be the judge.
 <START:Restaurant> in <END>  terms of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's name,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's appearance,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's attitude and  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , Always Sunday is quite unique on The Royal Mile, and is more the type of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you'd expect to find  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Bruntsfield or somewhere.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not perhaps the best little  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and tearoom  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Edinburgh, but on a street loaded with utter dives such as Rabbie Burns  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and Garfunkel's,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's certainly some way ahead of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's neighbours.Especially good with a  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and a newspaper.
This will be short and simple! Amazing  <START:Food> food <END> , amazing  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  with the  <START:A_Ent_Music> piano <END>  man playing.  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  was a bit bitchy and didn't say a word when we walked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  or when  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  us. Told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  I had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  for four,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  looked at me (up and down) and then grabbed a few  <START:S_Menu> menues <END>  and rushed us to a cramped  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  had more of a  <START:S_Stf_Appearance> personality <END>  and was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , until we all decided to move to the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>   <START:A_Places> room <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was  <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  too long  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  even noticing us as we sat. REALLY?  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was us and two other  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . HOW HARD CAN  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  BE! Oh  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ,  <START:Food> that <END> 's because  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  and Miss bitchy bitch  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  were too busy playing chatty cathy at the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  station. Sigh
Friday night, we were heading to Blue  <START:F_Drinks> martini <END>  for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked loud and packed, we were looking for some  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to talk. Since Ocean Prime was right next  <START:A_Furniture> door <END>  and didn't look quite as busy, we decided to stop  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  instead. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a very upscale  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and I immediately thought  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was going to be a pricey night and I was right. We went to the lovely  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some sort of  <START:F_FoodItem> berry <END>   <START:F_Drinks> martini <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had a  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  ball  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the center and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came with enough for 2  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the $14  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  tag. My boyfriend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a dirty  <START:F_Drinks> martini <END>  and  <START:Food> that <END>  also came with enough for 2. We had the best  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at Ocean Prime,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were  <START:A_Ent_Music> singing <END>  some of the old  <START:F_FoodItem> jams <END> . When  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  started  <START:A_Ent_Music> singing <END>  "doin the butt" I ran on the dance  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and danced my butt off. This is the kind of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  where you can leave your purse unattended which I did to go dance. I decided to try something to eat so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the ahi  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  tartare with  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came out and looked so pretty I felt like I shouldn't wat  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . But I did. Hahaha  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delicious.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't like  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  tartare I've had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the past though, this kinda  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . When our friend arrived we decided to try some  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . We both had a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of Moscato which was absolutely delicious and sweet, almost like a Reisling. Oh  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was VERY tasty and I do recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . My boyfriend and I danced the night away  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  until  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END>  up. We will  <START:O_Experience> be back <END> .
 <START:Food> food <END>  smelled  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  when we walked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  (2 of us), asked for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , 2  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  consulted each other, one  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  said  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be a  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , just sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and we'll get you when your  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  ready.  Sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , 1 woman on one end watching  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>  halfway thru  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> , a couple halfway thru their  <START:Food> meal <END>  on the other, we chose the middle  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  allowing 3 empty  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  either side of us, so we are pretty visible and alarmingly drinkless and  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> -less.   <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  made no eye contact for 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  despite walking back and forth several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  the already eating  <START:Food> diners <END> .  We then saw 3 ladies walk  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  who also were told to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  til their  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was ready.  So  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  we were at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , those girls who arrived after us were  <START:Service> served <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and handed  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> ,  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  back walked past the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  who saw we were sitting  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  awkwardly asked us if we needed  <START:Food> anything <END> , told him we were  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , brought us  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> , we asked barback for 2 shots  <START:F_Drinks> honey jack <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  told the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  and went to do  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  other duties.  So ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  after  <START:Food> that <END>  i watch the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  make 6  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  for a  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> ,  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  out the 3 ladies tab AS THE  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  SAT  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  TO A  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , (mind you  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  came  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  about 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  after us), still no shots we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  or eye contact from  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  as  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  passed us a dozen more  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .   So 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  LATER, our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  skipped us and gave away our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  ignores us, 2 different  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  forgets about us, shots  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  forgotten about, we look around for assistance,  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  deems not important to remind  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  we've been  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  We get up slowly making our way to the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> no one <END>  notices us and we leave. <START:Service> service <END>  from  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> : NEGATIVE 10Service from  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> : JUST PLAIN FOR GOT ABOUT US. <START:Service> service <END>  from barback: OUTSTANDING.So if you are a cute couple looking for good  <START:Service> service <END>  and wanting to eat something,  <START:Food> anything <END> , look else where,  if you are 3 nice looking cougars, don't worry, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  will easily ignore  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  patrons and skip the others before you and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  you priority.  NEVER COMING BACK, don't like being ignored and forgotten.    <START:F_Ingredients> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  did smell good though. (Don't know if  <START:Food> that <END> 's on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  because never received one.)
Good  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> . Polite and fast  <START:Service> service <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict.
My girlfriend and I ad the opportunity to stop  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the Black Dog on a Sunday afternoon and after a  <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  at two  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  near the back by a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  stand. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sampler platters <END>  so got a good range of  <START:Food> entree <END> 's and sides. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  (white  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ) was tender and the  <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END>  was smoked through wonderfully. I was not a huge fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was different and I would not hesitate to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> . I also had the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sampler and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a nice range of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  to compliment the  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was friendly and  <START:Service> service <END>  was fast but we never felt rushed at all. I will definitely stop  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i'm  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> .
We have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  countless  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> . FIrst of all, we are local Las Vegans. We've been to a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> , but mostly we steer away from the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotels <END> . Secondly, we found  <START:Restaurant> hotels <END>  which cater to locals usually offer pretty good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  for the  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> selections <END>  is incredible  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . After many visits, we still have  <START:Food> items <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  we have not tried yet. My favorite is  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp scampi <END>  over some  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  greens for  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with galic  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> clam chowder <END>  with artisan  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , steamed clam, diced  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> baked mussels <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>  short  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> . For  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  sweet and nicely sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> , creamy  <START:F_FoodItem> flan <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> banana foster <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>  gelato, fluffy and  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>  short  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> , and smooth  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . On top of all these,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offer  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  which is included  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Food> buffet <END> .
This was a total waste of 3 hours.   <START:Service> service <END> : glacialFood: crappyDessert: disgustingOverall: overhypedIf you like the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory, you'll probably like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  If you like actual  <START:Food> food <END> , run far far away.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  were  <START:F_Ingredients> dry <END>  and not cooked properly.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were  <START:A_Env_AC> cold <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> nasty <END> .  The frozen hot  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  has somehow earned rave reviews was disgustingly sweet.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> banana split <END>  was unpleasant.  The only good thing about Serendipity 3 is  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  way to differentiate idiots.  If someone likes this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , then you know  <START:Food> that <END>  you can safely ignore any other  <START:Service> recommendation <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  might make.  If  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , then you have a higher probability of getting a  <START:Service> recommendation <END>   <START:Food> that <END> 's useful.
We had  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  during a layover at the airport. Our  <START:S_Staff> sever <END>  was awesome. I wish I could remember  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  name.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was so nice and polite with  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  North Carolina accent and hospitality. The Bloody Marys were  <START:Food> really good <END>  and one of the better ones  <START:Food> that <END>  I have had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and thought  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very good if you like  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> . I would definitely come back if I were on a layover. I think  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is one of the better  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the airport.
Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  before a hockey  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> , and got  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and a local  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , I think  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the Kiltlifter.  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  were reasonable, the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were just spicy enough, and the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was good.  The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was recommended by a  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  when I told him  <START:Food> that <END>  I usually  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  Stone or Sam Adams.  Can't complain.
I had originally seen the other listing for this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  which had the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>  at four  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  rather than 2.75; and after being  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  I wish I would have seen this one first.2.75  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  is the perfect  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for the ratings to rest - La Parrilla Suiza is lackluster, tolerable Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's best.To be fair - the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is extremely nice and attentive.  Being a Sunday early afternoon  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was imperative  <START:Food> that <END>  my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  was replenished frequently and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was.  Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> !  The  <START:Food> food <END>  itself was pretty good as well - I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  and had the tortilla  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  which was very good.  The part  <START:Food> that <END>  knocks a plausible four  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  down to three is the lack of character  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just a big, open,  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  with vaguely Mexican-oriented  <START:A_Decor> decorations <END> .  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> pricing <END>  was average for Americanized  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  - ranging from about $9.50 - $14.00 a  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  which I would have definitely taken advantage of had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  not been a Sunday and the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  been less than $4.50 a piece.  Overall - If  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not too out of your way and you're  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a bind, La Parrilla Suiza won't be the worst  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> .  I'd much rather head to either an authentic  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like Salazar Brothers or a slightly more upscale  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like El Zocalo.
This is an amazing  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and a jewel of a find  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  AZ!  When you step into the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  you are immediately transported from the Southwest to Paris!  I was shocked... Yes... Really shocked to find to find the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . All of the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  love the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and specialize  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  one thing or another. The  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> ,  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , and ABSINTHE (yes, absinthe) are spot on!  Dustin is the  <START:S_Staff> sommelier <END>  and knows  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:Food> stuff <END>  about French  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END> . Try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bouillabaisse <END> , grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> escargot <END> !  You won't be disappointed. Most important!!!!!! Have the Absinthe!!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's prepare authentically and is fantastic. Bottom  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> :  This is a MUST try  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  anywhere.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's one of my new favorite  <START:Restaurant> haunts <END> !!!!!!
I had an excellent  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at this  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  owned  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a cute  <START:A_LocatedArea> area <END>  of Montreal, Quebec. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Pierogi - dumplings filled with  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were delicious. I also had the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  Blintz and Borshct, both of which were the best I have ever had. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent, but Mazurka is a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for the incredible  <START:Food> food <END> .
The ' <START:F_FoodItem> shroom <END>  does offer a  <START:S_Menu> good selection <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and our house special pie was generously topped. I'd still  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  only slightly above average at a high  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . Better part of a  <START:O_Pay_Price> fifty dollar <END>   <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  for a medium and two drafts. <START:Service> service <END>  continues to be spotty and indifferent. The dishwasher must not be working properly as the  <START:S_Cutlery> flatware <END>  was also spotty. And I hate when I have to straighten  <START:S_Cutlery> fork <END>  tines...I'm thinking the best option  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  drafts and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> .
good thing i've eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  before. the  <START:Food> food <END>  has been amazing but the last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i was  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  i was so pounded  <START:Food> that <END>  i remember  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> vod and cran <END>  as soon as we sat down. the next thing i remember is like a snap-shot of my red  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  sitting on the white  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  cloth, then i woke up  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  my  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>   <START:A_Places> room <END>  the next morning...don't even remember eating this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  has always been  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .
Open letter to the  <START:S_Staff> management <END> : <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is something you seem not to know about your  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  try to take advantage of your customers by  <START:O_Pay_Method> rounded down <END>  the change on a ticket. Let's say a ticket totaled $17.31, and I gave  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  a $20 and a $10, what should I have gotten  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  change? Why any 3rd grader will tell you $12.69 (broken into 1's and a $ <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> ). What I got was $12.00 even,  <START:O_Pay_Method> shorting <END>  me you $0.69. Is this a big deal? Not once  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not but after having this  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> behavior <END>  happen at your  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has become a habit with your  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , assuming the change. To compound this, this particular  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  I had called this on  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  before. I had also informed  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  before and so obviously nothing had been done. Did I get pissed off, yeah... I certainly did (and admittedly a bit over the top). Did a  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  both to ask why I was so upset... no. OK... so I'm 86'ed from your little  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ... plenty of  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Vegas, but you should know  <START:Food> that <END>  your  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is not as honest with your customers as you would like to think and your  <START:S_Staff> rep <END>  on the street is reflecting of this. I had been warned (by a former  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  of yours)  <START:Food> that <END>  this was the "inside baseball" thing  <START:Food> that <END>  happened  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  but I couldn't believe  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Obviously  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was true. The shame of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all is unfortunately this sort of  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> behavior <END>  has spread to other  <START:Restaurant> places <END> , and I would assume  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is the economy  <START:Food> that <END>  spurs this on.The funny thing is, when a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  brings me my  <START:O_Payment> change rounded <END>  the other way (so maybe I get a few cents extra back), I usually am sure to  <START:O_Payment> tip <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back and then some, and  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  who know me know I am not a cheap  <START:O_Payment> tipper <END> . (Unless you assume the change and then I am likely to leave nothing at all, seeing as how you've taken your  <START:O_Payment> tip <END>  already.)So yeah,  <START:Restaurant> 86 me <END> , but be sure to fire your  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are doing you a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  disservice. And now you know what gets gossiped about your  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> , a rare thing for  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  to learn, and I'd use  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  if I were you.-JBNeed to contact me: yelp@visual-impact.com
Timber's was the final stop last night to conclude some birthday debauchery for one of my best friends.  Phil, the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> , was fantastic  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  letting us play endless rounds of  <START:A_Plc_Bar> pool <END> , and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  Jameson shots to our hearts' desire.Timber's wasn't very busy, however, the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> pool <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> / <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  side of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  looked like a hurricane had hit  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  bottles, pint glasses, papers all over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  I'm not sure if Phil was shorthanded but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was a mess before we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Regardless, we all had a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and accomplished our mission of b-day fun for my buddy.
Fantastic!   <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  and unique.  Scotty was attentive, humorous and knowledgeable.  I would recommend multiple visits because everything we tried was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  We actually went two nights  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a row.
I  <START:Restaurant> dined <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  the other day and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a unique  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  from the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  is nothing like the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  on the inside. The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  itself surprised me because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a very oriental  <START:A_Decor> theme <END>  setting.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a very nice change from the modern "vegas" setting  <START:A_Decor> theme <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> . Soyo Korean Barstaurant's  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  reminds me of the  <START:A_Decor> theme <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  China.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had high  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  which created a sense of intimacy but I could still  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  sitting behind be talking. The  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  to the  <START:S_Cutlery> cups <END>  we used to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  caught my attention and made  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  stick out.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  barley  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  instead of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  with thin  <START:S_Cutlery> tin bowls <END>  as  <START:S_Cutlery> cups <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  to try but we requested  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  shortly after. I didn't like the  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and I am a heavy  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  drinker. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Kalbi  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  as well as the Spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Tofu  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  came out quickly after we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . The Spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Tofu  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  had  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and the Kalbi was cooked well done, like we asked. My overall first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Yogurt Cocktail Soju.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a little stronger than what I've had before but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was good.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was only $12 for a large  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of Soju. I also noticed the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  for only $3.50 a pint and $13 a pitcher which I thought was a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> !The only aspect of holding me back on rating this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> , is the language barrier I had with our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  spoke enough english to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  but not to explain clearly some of the  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  we had questions about.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard to understand what  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was saying even though  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was trying to pronounce  <START:S_Staff> his <END>  words slower. Communication was a little difficult through out our  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at dining  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !! One of my favorites!  <START:Service> service <END>  is always  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> ! <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious, a few of my favorites are:  <START:F_FoodItem> fusion torta <END>  with spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  sliders, the bulgogi  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  and the kimchi fried  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . I can never get enough of Komex!!PS: their homemade hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is a must try!
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was really  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> . Friendly, warm  <START:Service> service <END> . Not to mention, probably the best Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  I've had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Madison. I'll definitely be going back.
Such a good  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> !! So juicy and delicious!! Lots of  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are all...  <START:Offers> free <END>  (except for a select few)!! Their  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are OK. I prefer  <START:Restaurant> in <END> -n-outs better, but I'll live. My biggest complaint is the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  takes  <START:W_Waiting> longer <END>  than any fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint to get your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's double the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . Yes,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are delicious, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's still just a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . I do really like the fact  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have peanuts to  <START:F_Appetizer> snack <END>  on while you're  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END> !  <START:Food> that <END>  does help.
Be prepared to be WOW'd! Windsor is one of the best spots  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Phoenix if you are looking for amazing  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , awesome  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , and possibly the best  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  night, or just getting together with friends! The overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  for me was one of the best  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is.I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was more than enough  <START:Food> food <END>  and was so good. My friends both got  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  absolutely loved  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . I think  <START:Food> that <END>  one thing  <START:Food> that <END>  sets Windsor over most other spots  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Phoenix is the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ! Like Postino before  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , Windsor's  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is awesome and make you feel like part of the  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  the second you walk  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> ! I have and will continue to send  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  to Windsor! So far every person I have told to go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  has text or called me the next day thanking me because  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so much! Go... you won't regret  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !
If you live out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Phoenix  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a number of good BBQ  <START:Restaurant> places <END> , many of which have a strongly Southern focus on BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , specifically  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  and pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  already  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  with or covered  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Texas BBQ, at least from my own personal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  (born  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Texas and raised  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  till I was twelve and moved to Hawaii, which has a very different type of BBQ), is generally  <START:F_Ingredients> dry <END>  rubbed and smoked and any  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is put on after you get your  <START:Food> meal <END> , at your discretion, and of course, thanks to the bountiful supply of cattle  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the early years of the state  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a strong focus on  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  BBQ and  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  addition, thanks to the many German settlers,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is also known for some  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  smoked sausage ( <START:Restaurant> in <END>  fact, if you find yourself  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Corpus Christie take a drive out and go to  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  Grove, a small  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> , at least when I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  20 years ago  <START:Food> that <END>  is very German and wow, the sausage, but  <START:Food> that <END>  is another story).Well, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , based on the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  (always my ultimate test of Texas BBQ) makes some  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  BBQ and even better,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has the bare bones approach to  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  is standard  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  many little Texas BBQ joints and many  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  hole  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  general.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not  <START:Restaurant> in <END> , to say the least, the fancy part of  <START:A_LocatedArea> town <END> , all transactions are done  <START:Restaurant> in <END>   <START:O_Pay_Price> cash <END>  so leave your credit card at home, and the  <START:Food> meal <END>  is provided on an empty  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  crate bottom sort of thing with a piece of butcher paper on  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and then the sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  of your  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  is on another piece of butcher paper and when  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  ask how many slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  you want, and you reply,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  reach into the drawer below the  <START:O_Pay_Price> cash <END>  register, rip open a  <START:F_Ingredients> loaf <END>  of sliced Wonder  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  (or the equivalent) and give you  <START:Food> that <END>  to make the  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  folded  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  of sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . You can also get a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  special but I'm a traditionalist, I'll make my own. <START:Restaurant> in <END>  addition, I have an obsession with  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  at BBQ  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  (once again, an offshoot of the German influence, I would think, on Texas BBQ  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  and boy, the  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is classic  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Oh, and to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , if you are off work,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  do have Shiner Bock,  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the bottle, along with a number of other  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and if you look up the Shiner brewery website, you will once again, see the strong German influence and one thing  <START:Food> that <END>  I don't think is German, but definitely Texas, Country  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the  <START:A_Ent_Music> sound <END>  track.Now, for those looking for a luxury  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , you may need to go to Joe's BBQ, which two of my 3 dining companions said  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  liked better (the whole slices of Wonder  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  did not excite  <START:S_Staff> them <END> , but one of the  <START:S_Staff> people <END> , along with me, was sold on this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is VERY authentic Texas hole- <START:Restaurant> in <END> -the- <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  BBQ and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  does  <START:Food> that <END>  well and if you are looking for something other than the no-frills approach to the BBQ  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , then some other  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  may be more to your liking.
I usually don't take the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to write reviews, so you can bet  <START:Food> that <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is special. Definitely got a local  <START:Food> hispanic <END>  vibe when we arrived, but the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  Everything is made  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  right  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  front of you.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have 3  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  stations for each type of  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I recommend the adobado and asada  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> .If want a delicious alternative to  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> , try the adobado  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are piled high  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a large to go box with spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  Very delish!!!   I grew up on mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is as authenticate as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gets!!
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is good. If you're stuck uptown and want some "Q" as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  were, this is a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's exactly what you might imagine an "uptown BBQ" joint would be like. Busy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , "club" type  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> , "fancier" country fare (if  <START:Food> that <END>  makes sense - this ain't no paw's country cookin') and a generally more "uptown" clientele. Don't get me wrong,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was tasty, if pricey,  <START:Food> food <END>  - pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  with a bevy of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  to choose from,  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , mac &  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , hushpuppies.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might be a tad ambitious - the night I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  (granted  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a Saturday night, right before a Bobcats  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> ), the  <START:Service> service <END>  was slow and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seemed like the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  was very backed up - I wonder if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have too many  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .
See Rachel C's review which kind of hits the nail on the head.  I came with friends on a Friday night around 7.  Was told 30-45  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , which turned out to be more like  <START:O_Pay_Price> 15 <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  Meanwhile a  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  stopped by and took  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  while we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  -- nice touch!One thing struck me upon entry:  Why are we  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the middle of East Liberty and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are only two...umm....non-White  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the whole  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> ?  I'm just sayin, the clientele doesn't at all match the  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> .  And this is my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> .  I was skeptical.The potential answer?  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> .  All sides are a la carte at around $3-$ <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> ....and  <START:Food> that <END>  includes a slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END> .   You're gonna  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for your  <START:Food> entree <END>  ($10-$22) plus a side or two ($ <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END> ) plus a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  ($9 for a whiskey  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END> ).  Not exactly a cheap  <START:Food> meal <END>  for Pittsburgh. <START:Food> that <END>  SAID....I wanted to bad mouth this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  But the  <START:Food> food <END>  made up for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  were PERFECT.  The fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ?  The best we've ever had  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  Pittsburgh.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  was amazing.Bottom  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> :  We'll  <START:O_Experience> be back <END> .  Hell, maybe tomorrow.  Except we left with enough  <START:Food> leftovers <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  is already taken care of.
Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with a co-worker and  <START:Food> food <END>  was good. Very clean and  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  and hot.
THEIVES;  <START:Food> that <END>  is all I can say. Was staying at  <START:A_Places> stratosphere <END>  next  <START:A_Furniture> door <END> . We went to use the internet  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and after we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  we went on computers to print out airplane tickets. Then the  <START:S_Staff> security guard <END>  comes by and then tells us to stand back and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  will get us a  <START:O_Payment> refund <END>  because the machine wasn't working. THen  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  comes back and doesn't give us the  <START:O_Payment> refund <END>  and tells us the leave. We short  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END>  and left without printing out tickets. I would  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  0  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  on  <START:Service> service <END>  if I could.** This review is not about  <START:Food> food <END> .
What a beautiful  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !! Luv the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  & the  <START:A_Decor> layout <END> !! The  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the  <START:A_OutsideView> waterfalls <END>  is done superbly!! And the  <START:Food> food <END> , very very good! Delishhhh!!!A perfect  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to take someone special!! Servings are  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  good  <START:A_Places> portion <END> !I enjoyed my dinner with the girls!!!
 <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's me and my bestfriends birthday! We wanna do a girls  <START:Food> comp dinner <END>  somewhere... Bagatelle  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's eight of us girls. We are  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  at a round  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and two of us decide to go to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to get some  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . We asked if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  still do the first round of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  for  <START:Offers> free <END> ?  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said Yes. So we got eight  <START:F_Drinks> delicious shots <END>  and back to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to down  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  to the other girls while we were gone and then I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  promptly  <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>   <START:S_Staff> them <END> . Dinner  <START:Service> service <END>  started... Bagatelle  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  - pretty much giant  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  leaves with some type of  <START:F_Ingredients> vinaigrette <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  for  <START:Food> entrees <END>  and mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> hericot verts <END>  for sides. So  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are eight of us girls, and for the  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are four pieces each. So we all just split everything... This was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> comp dinner <END>  but someone within our group had been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  before and said the had always gotten A LOT more  <START:Food> food <END>  than what we had just been  <START:Service> served <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was all GOOD though, tasty, but I could have had more! We did have a  <START:Food> vegetarian <END>  among us though and the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  did accommodate  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  and brought out a  <START:Food> vegetarian <END>  risotto  <START:Food> dish <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  was pretty freakin' good too! Oh and of course I checked  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  on YELP and a check  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  offer popped up for a  <START:Offers> free <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> bubbly <END> ! I asked our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  Martin about  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  would ask  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:S_Staff> manager <END> . Griffin came over and I  <START:A_Entertainment> showed <END>  him the check  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  and asked him if  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  would honor  <START:Food> that <END> ? I know we are getting a  <START:Food> comp'd dinner <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't hurt to ask!  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was very nice and said  <START:Food> that <END>  was cool and then we all got a  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  of the  <START:F_Drinks> bubbles! <END> For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we had little tiny  <START:F_FoodItem> creme brulees <END> . Not very much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  involved, and I think  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  torched the tops of  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  a little too much but whatever - we scarfed those down.  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to check out with our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  and head to Ellis Island....The  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  comes and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is $89. Apparently  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was some misunderstanding about  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ... We had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  those shots from the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and I guess the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  had transferred those over to our tab and then we had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a round of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  but thought our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  had said those were comp'd but only the shots got comp'd.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's not  <START:Food> that <END>  we didn't want to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or  <START:Food> anything <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just  <START:Food> that <END>  when you think something is taken care of and then  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ISN'T we're like WTF??? Not a big deal anyway, we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  and hooked our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  up and then we on our merry little ways to... Ellis Island! Would I come back  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ? Yes, but either with less  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  or a better understanding of what and how much  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are actually going to  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  us!  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was all VERY nice and  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and we had a lot of fun!
Very good and run by  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:S_Staff> people <END>  from Israel. You won't be disappointed!
If you're having a case of the munchies at 11pm, make sure to check out the  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  at Yonaka to take advantage of discounted  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  on some  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Even for dinner,  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are pretty reasonable compared to lot of  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>   <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  this caliber of  <START:Food> food <END> . If  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's your first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> omakase <END>  is the way to go. The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is nice for a  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  night and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is prompt and friendly.Almost everything is good  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Standing out from their regular  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  were the uni to ikura  <START:Food> dish <END> , wagyu  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and the seared foie gras  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . The latter is just so buttery,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  melts  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  your mouth.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are also several must-try  <START:Food> items <END>  on their  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  like the  <START:F_FoodItem> crispy brussel sprouts <END> ; the sake orenji which consists of  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  on top of sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> oranges <END>  and special  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ; and the chuka  <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END>  which are  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly baos. Don't care what those talking chihuahuas say, this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for fourth  <START:Food> meal <END> .With more delicious  <START:Food> dishes <END>  to try, Yonaka is quickly becoming one of my favorite  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to eat.
Discovered this gem during a vintage staycation! Had  <START:Food> lunch <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> , loved the decore! MY  <START:Food> food <END>  was good. Hubs  <START:Food> food <END>  was better! Love the sirracha (?)  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> ! And of course the peach sangria. Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  getting the pitcher! Had so much fun on the seesaw! Haven't giggled like  <START:Food> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a while! Going back for brunch  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  a few weeks.
My wife and I went for an early dinner last Saturday and I have to say I am impressed.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  and the  <START:Service> services <END>  was attentive.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's so nice to have a comfortable  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  so  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a good  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  I definitely recommend going  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .
Gem!!! What a fantastic little  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Exceptional  <START:Food> food <END>  and even better  <START:Service> service <END> . You can feel the  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  cooks right  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  front of you. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  comes out and pours a  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>   <START:F_Drinks> liquor <END> . This is a piece of Italy  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  American Southwest. Dont miss.
This Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  the real deal. Everything is made  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .
Oh McFadden's where to start... I've never been to a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  was soooo obsessed with trying to create the illusion of fun than promoting  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Every  <START:O_Pay_Price> 5 <END>  mins you have your Deja Vu(esque) DJ calling for  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  to get on the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  and dance. Which is fine. But 1. some  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  aren't meant to be dancing on  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  but might be better suited being pushed off  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . 2. Kind of sucks trying to get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  when you have to navigate  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> nasty <END>  feet. 3. The majority of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  are " <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END> " (i use  <START:Food> that <END>  term liberally) which means less  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  dealing with customers behind the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Which means  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>   <START:W_Waiting> longer <END>  to get a stupid  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . The easiest way to get a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  would be to grow boobs and work  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  because every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I looked around their  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  were able to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  more than I could even  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . McFadden's will be another Cadillac Ranch, Ranch House, and Coconuts. I appreciate trying to create this party  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  but not at the expense of the customers.
We just had  <START:Food> breakfast <END> !!!  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty good!!!This is a new  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems where ever  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  open a new  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  do well! I would recommend  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  over Mcdonalds any day! I believe this is long enough to be posted!
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Food> really good <END> , the head  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  is rude and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is slow
A big upgrade from the Robbie Foxx days. Very good for big groups.  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>  also very noteworthy. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is nothing extraordinary - but -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't matter.  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang out.  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  is very good.
We enjoyed the  <START:F_FoodItem> barbecue <END>  and  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Husband got the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  w/  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  platter.  <START:S_Staff> his <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was too big and messy to pick up right away but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was tasty. My  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  had tons of  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  which I only like 1/3 of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I also had the cheesy  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END> . All was tasty. I liked the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  b/c  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was laid back. Half of the  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  had small kids but the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> ,  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>  and noise level was perfect so  <START:Food> that <END>  the kids can be themselves and loud w/o bothering others.
Visitung Arizona because a  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  friend is going to a treatment center for stomach cancer.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  has no  <START:F_Appetizer> appetite <END>  but Nourish had  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Food> that <END>  was delicious and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> her <END> . We didn't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to long for our  <START:Food> food <END>  to be ready.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  got a yogurt  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:A_Furniture> refrigerator <END>   <START:Food> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  loved and ate for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  the next morning. We will defiantly  <START:O_Experience> be back <END>  while visiting. Thank you Nourish.
Cool concept, but not fully executed to  <START:Restaurant> its <END>  potential.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a baked  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> /mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where you choose all of your  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> .  The  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  was right, but the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  didn't seem as  <START:F_Ingredients> fresh <END>  as  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  should or could be.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  had their friends/ <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>   <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were extremely loud... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:Ambience> quite distracting <END>  being the only  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  customer  <START:Restaurant> in <END>  the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .

Went with a galpal for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  not  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  ago. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was, well,  <START:Food> it <END>  was like a glorified  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was loud, but upbeat and  <START:Food> it <END>  was packed with college age kids watching a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . The  <START:A_Ent_Tv> flat screens <END>  are nice, but  <START:Food> it <END> 's not my  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>   <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  for watching  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> long <END> .  <START:Food> lunch <END>  was ok,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  aren't bad. The  <START:Food> fries <END>  took so  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  to come out  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , who was a riot, came to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and looked at us and says, deadpan, I'm going in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  to make your  <START:Food> fries <END> . I'll be right back. Five or so  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's got a  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END>  stain on his shirt and  <START:Food> fries <END>  in his hand. I don't know if  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  actually made  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  or not, but I got a kick out of  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . I give  <START:Food> it <END>  an A-OK for a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  hangout but all around I'm pretty underwhelmed by  <START:Food> it <END> .
I can't believe this gem has no reviews.  I stopped by America's Taco  <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  the other night expecting something similar to what I get at El Rinconcito.  No comparison whatsoever.  The carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are far superior and much for sizeable.  Sure the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  isn't nearly as  <START:A_Decor> fancy <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent.  The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  are  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  but you will likely need to brush up on your Spanish before you go.  I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Great  <START:Service> service <END>  & great  <START:Food> food <END> ! Brought a  <START:A_Env_Size> group <END>  of 13, 5 being small children.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was so kind!!!
Good sign when the crowd includes policemen, firemen, business and more importantly locals.  Another good sign when my 3 and 4 year old make me  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  not one extra  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  but two  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  so  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  could get thirds.
4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  just because how could I give Taco Bell 5??To start, I am biased towards  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrapped <END>  in a  <START:Food> tortilla <END> ..  I love  <START:Food> it <END> ..  Put  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  or  <START:F_Dessert> ice cream <END>  in a  <START:Food> tortilla <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  is just  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  much better.  Short of the extreme of the Taco  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  SNL  <START:A_Decor> sketch <END>  (google  <START:Food> it <END> ),  <START:F_FoodItem> wrap <END>  my  <START:Food> meal <END>  in a  <START:Food> tortilla <END>  to go!Ok, as for Taco Bell, for the most part you know what you are going to get.  While I have had a few 7-layer  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were "off" in the past, for the most part,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is little surprise.I just want to commend this particular  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  is probably the busiest Taco Bell I have ever seen.  Any day M-F and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a mad house at  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  Thankfully,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are super fast on servicing both the " <START:Restaurant> here <END> " and "To Go"  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> ..   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's  <START:Food> it <END> ..  4 starts for a Taco Bell  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivers <END>  the highest  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  fast  <START:Food> food <END>  mexican at the fastest  <START:Restaurant> pace <END> !
Just tried this  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ....although I have lived in the neighborhood 7 yrs...   The  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have on their brochure depicts a nicely browned and bubbly  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  reflecting lots of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  actually looked like  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ...Unfortunately the actual  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  looks absolutely nothing like the  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> ...I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was 2 slices  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  had 2  pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rest <END>   had one little  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>  on each slice.The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is very  <START:Food> doughy <END> ....the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  are sparse and the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  is a paper thin layer  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  resembles a dominoes or papa john type.....In essence....for $7.40 appox for a 1  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  will do when you just crave  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and have little funds ...Remember....you get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for!   I do have to compliment  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  on the quaint eating  <START:A_Places> area <END>  ....just a few  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  but very  <START:A_Environment> homey <END>  feeling.....very nice  <START:S_Staff> employees <END> .I am not sure if I will try  <START:Food> it <END>  again....
Good  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END> .  Over  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> .
Keeping this short and sweet:  The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like the  <START:Food> food <END>  you get in Thailand.  Authentic enough for you Phoenix?
This was our second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  having china rainbow, and I can officially say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I am a fan. I decided we would try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  has two unusual  <START:F_Ingredients> proteins <END>  for a valley  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> duck <END> . I'm used to these at nicer  <START:Restaurant> resturants <END>  back east but not out  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . My wife had the Yuling  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we went and I can say  <START:Food> it <END>  was great. A full  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  breast fried in  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>  and perfect with the delicious yuling  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and I had hunan  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  good and spicy...super spicy and tasty. I didn't  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  for the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chestnuts <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> wonton <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  otherwise  <START:Food> it <END>  was good. Tonight we got takeout and I took the plunge and got the yuling  <START:F_Ingredients> duck <END>  and the wife got  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  "highly recommends" the  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and for good reason,  <START:Food> it <END>  was really good. I would  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  for myself everytime we go but I'm gonna try something new next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I got the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> wonton <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  which was a waste of  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END>  even if  <START:Food> it <END>  was just $3  <START:Food> it <END>  was just fried  <START:F_FoodItem> wonton <END>  wrappers with no filling I was expecting actual  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  fried wontons or for  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  to be stuffed with something. Still a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with really good and very reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
drove up to wickenburg w/friends to have  <START:Food> lunch <END>  we decided to try anitas . i had the carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  w/ <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were smokey and flavorfull  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were very good as well wife had the  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rellenos <END>  good  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  our friends  <START:Food> meals <END>  were brought to  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  switched  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  so  <START:Food> it <END>  took our friends a few  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to figure  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  out.. <START:Service> service <END>  was good (except for the  <START:F_Ingredients> mix <END>  up) will defenetly return  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  also do  <START:Food> breakfast <END> 
Worst  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  I've ever had! So soggy and too much  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I hate  <START:Food> it <END>  when the crust is soggy!!!
I'm not sure what else to say about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hasn't been already said. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is LEGIT.  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> lines <END>  are  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  but goes fast.  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  has always been fresh as can be when I go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is the best I have tried in the south so far.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was top notch also. The south for sure is very very nice and  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is no exception.This is my  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat again when coming back to NC.
 <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have good  <START:Food> food <END>  and I love their Hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END> !
"EAT MO BETTAH!' I sure did!Walk into this small  <START:Ambience> building <END> ,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  your  <START:Food> food <END>  from a super chill lay back  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END>  you feel like you in New Orleans. The commercial for Zatarain's was playing in my mind the whole  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was eating. But so much better then the box  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END> .Would recommend the Mardi Gras Combo (red  <START:F_FoodItem>   bean  &rive <END> , jambalaya &  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  creole) because most of the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I can't make up my mind. Now the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Étouffée is said to be very, very hot. So I got a half  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to play  <START:Food> it <END>  safe. For me I've had spicier  <START:Food> food <END>  elsewhere. Don't get me wrong  <START:Food> it <END> 's hot put not with 2 verys. I was kinda let down by this cause I LOVE spicy  <START:Food> food <END> . Hotter the better.
I love  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! Their sizzling  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  is awesome, and you usually get enough for three  <START:Food> meals <END> . Lots of  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:S_Menu> options <END> , and my husband loves their  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  (as did I when I used to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ). Ask for  <START:Food> it <END>  spicy --  <START:Food> it <END> 's delish!
If I lived in Vegas, I would be  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  ALL the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . LOVE.  <START:Food> things <END>  to dig:Its pretty. Really. Love the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> . <START:Service> service <END> . I am a whore for good  <START:Service> service <END> . FRESH. SUPER FRESH. UBER FRESH. yay  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> !Fave apps:1. Wok Fried Calamari and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> - lightly fried and golden with a sweet and spicy dip laced with  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . 2. Korabuta  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Potstickers- extra  <START:Offers> special <END>  potstickers, not at all greasy with an awesome  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .3.  <START:F_Ingredients> filo <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wrapped <END>  Tiger  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END> - shredded  <START:F_Ingredients> filo <END>  envelops these gigantic  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are laid in a  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> - <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is out of this world.Fave  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> :1. Little Buddha  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> - this is one of  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  where  <START:Food> it <END>  is a lot, but  <START:Food> it <END>  all just goes together. The  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  is awesome and of  <START:S_Menu> course <END>  anytime you have spicy and sweet together I am a fan. 2. Fantasy  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> - light and fresh. The  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  is real and king and the  <START:F_FoodItem> halibut <END>  is thin on top.3. Palm's  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> - killer Naruto, not too spicy.I am not a fan of spicy  <START:Food> food <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  else loves the  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail <END> . And I have to admit, the only  <START:Food> entree <END>  I have tried is the  <START:F_FoodItem> fried   rice   <END>  :)Sake  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is great,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have  <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  for after  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pistachio <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> creme brulee <END>  is to die for. Pretty expensive, but this is Vegas. Unless you leave the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> , this is what you will  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>   <START:Restaurant> everywhere <END> . Plus, the Palms is very generous with  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> comps <END> . Get a  <START:O_Pay_Method> card <END>  even if you aren't playing much and you might be  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END>  how much you  <START:Offers> get off <END>  your  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  (just give  <START:Food> it <END>  to your  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  will take  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  of  <START:Food> it <END> ). Of  <START:S_Menu> course <END> ,  <START:A_Ent_Music> comps <END>  can't cover  <START:Service> tip <END> . Single gripe:  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't have  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END>  :(
Overall 3.5 starsGold medal - sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Silver medal - uniBronze medal -  gyozaIf you are looking for  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  then  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  coma is better.  If you are looking for  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  at Yama are really yum.The sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  at Yama is really good.   <START:Food> it <END>  is large  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimps <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fry <END>  the head.The  <START:F_FoodItem> uni <END>  was fresh and super creamy.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> gyoza <END>  was very crispy and tasty.  Super  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , so try to get  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  early.Happy Sushiing!!
I love Fuji.  I have been coming to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for as  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  as I can remember because  <START:Food> it <END>  has been my entire life.  Since  <START:Food> it <END>  is one of my grandfather's favorite  <START:Restaurant> places <END> , I have been sat in a  <START:A_Furniture> highchair <END>  at Fuji as well as celebrated my college graduation with friends and  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> .  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is simple, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is always solid.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  and not as slow as some other reviews suggest.  And the  <START:Food> food <END>  is totally authentic home-style Japanese.   <START:Food> it <END>  reminds me of my grandmother's  <START:Food> food <END>  - a memory  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   has not been invoked by any other Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .Consistent and delicious, you can count on Fuji to fulfill a Japanese craving.
Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the Snow White  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .  Amazing.  I don't know exactly all  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  put in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , but the  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  goes on  <START:Food> it <END> , is what makes  <START:Food> it <END>  so amazing.I've done the AYCE  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  is a bit pricey and will only be  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  if you're a big eater.  Oh, and make sure you finish  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , otherwise,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  will  <START:O_Payment> charge <END>  you a la carte for  <START:Food> it <END> .
I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  chops in a  <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END>  Serrano  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  reduction  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The chose I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  medium rare. The  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  was saturated in this  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  which was incredibly over powering, too vinegary and really needed to reduce longer or use a better  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END> . I had this  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth for days.  <START:Food> it <END>  was edible but I don't feel was executed properly and for the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  I would expect  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . When i told the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:Food> it <END> 's not for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> . I explained  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the issue was the  <START:F_Ingredients> vinegar <END>  was over powering and if  <START:Food> it <END>  was properly done  <START:Food> it <END>  should be more sweet than  <START:F_Ingredients> vinegar <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  chops were a little over done  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  medium well-ish and were and effort to cut. The  <START:F_FoodItem> tamale <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  with  <START:Food> it <END>  was underwhelming at best. My friend had the  <START:F_FoodItem> ciopinno <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  was phenomenal.. I was very  very jealous of his  <START:Food> dish <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was lovely to share with me. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  of the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  was sensational, I could  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .We had the  <START:F_Ingredients> hibiscus <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END> , which I loved! The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  at the beginning was interesting. Some I liked more than others. the  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  I felt just had a weird  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> baking soda <END>  was intense. My husband didn't seem to notice. The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  definitely leaves something to be desires. I feel more as if i am in some high  <START:Ambience> ceiling <END> -ed  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END>  with  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  cloths.  <START:Food> it <END> 's not romantic or  <START:Offers> special <END> , more of a  <START:A_Entertainment> cattle call <END> . I think the  <START:A_Decor> design <END>  could have lent a little more to the  <START:A_Environment> intimacy <END>  and  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of enjoying the  <START:Food> food <END> . Again, for the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  I have had better for less. Based on my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and for the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , I would say I expected more.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> ciopinno <END>  is what saved my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I might try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  again if I was with a  <START:A_Env_Size> group <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> person <END>  who insisted on going but would not get the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END> , and most likely wouldn't seek  <START:Food> it <END>  out again.
For a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not bad at all. Dont get me wrong, I have nothing against  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  chains. In fact,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are pretty good sometimes because you know  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is going to be consistent  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  and you will not be in for a surprise,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is bound to be a regular  <START:Food> dish <END>  off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you like and always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and so on. We went to Biaggi's for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . After we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> , a  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  came up to us and while  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was greeting us, explaining what the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of the day was,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was preparing a  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  oil with  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  on a small  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  simultaneously (talk about multitasking..). After taking our  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  for  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> warm <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were two types of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> - one was a regular  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , the other one was.. i dont remember actually. My husband got a  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  -  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  was extremely tasty! For  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:S_Menu> course <END> , I got the  <START:F_FoodItem>   penne   sardi <END>  without the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and my husband got the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> parmiagana <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem>   penne   sardi <END>  turned out be the best  <START:F_FoodItem> penne <END>  I have ever had so far. With the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> breadcrumbs <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  with a hint of  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  creamy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , this was absolutely great! And, after getting to know the fact  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> , i was pleasantly  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END> , since the overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>  was way beyond expectation compared to any other  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a good  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> . But their  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:S_Menu> course <END>  is so filling  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you end up taking the  <START:Food> food <END>  home and leave without tasting the  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> . <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a good  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  too and usually,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:S_Menu> suggestions <END>  available for pairing with your  <START:Food> food <END>  as well. When you enter the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , you will find a lot of business cards on a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . These happen to be the business cards of the different  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  working in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> . I found this pretty  <START:A_Environment> neat <END>  :)The  <START:A_Places> downside <END>  of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the  <START:Food> food <END>  is a little over  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> . But I would highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> - the German  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pretzels <END> . Especially the  <START:F_FoodItem> pretzels <END> - one of the tastiest  <START:F_FoodItem> pretzels <END>  I have ever had.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a large  <START:A_Env_Size> group <END>  of us- all very  <START:A_Plc_Bar> drunk <END>  as part of a  <START:A_Environment> bachelor   party   <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitstaff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> patent <END>  with us, as Vegas is all about drunken douchebags causing problems. Eventually, after several Nazi jokes and broken  <START:F_Drinks> steins <END> , we got kicked out. What was painful was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we got some  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  in the  <START:Food> food <END>  of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  next to us, and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  stuck us with part of their  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> ....
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Lived  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  for 5 yrs, and only Indulge  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  comes even  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END> ...but still by a  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  shot. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is amazing, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> caprese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  is even to die. The most  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  around. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are delicious, the  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  are incredible, and if you don't mind the possibility of a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is great too. Not to mention the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  is off the hook. Something for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> . Don't have a take on the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , not a big  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  connoisseur. And also not a red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  eater, but I bring all of my out of town visitors (from the midwest... <START:Restaurant> they <END>  know their  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ) and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  love  <START:Food> it <END> ! MmmMMmmMMmmm!
Not much for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  just  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> 
Good  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  but a bit expensive all you can eat is $ 30B
Fix  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and Grill is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>   inside the Bellagio  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> . I  <START:Restaurant> dined <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  only because my sister was getting married at the Bellagio. We had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  for a  <START:A_Env_Type> party <END>  of 20, if your entire  <START:A_Env_Type> party <END>  can't make  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a $40  <START:O_Pay_Price> fee <END>  per empty  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> . Our  <START:A_Env_Type> party <END>  was seperated into 3  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have no large  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> . After being  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  we where greeted by several  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  share the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . We were  <START:Service> served <END>  by a very mean  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  gave us total  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attitude <END> , forgot to take one persons  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  30 mintues for our  <START:Food> food <END> . While the other two  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  ate we sat staring at each other. I spoke to the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  about our  <START:Service> horrible <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  apologized, of  <START:S_Menu> course <END> . Out of our three  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  mine was the only one  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  added the  <START:Service> tip <END>  to our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . So my thinking is because we didn't not  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  as much  <START:F_Drinks> liquor <END>  as all the other  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and I spoke to the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  then added the  <START:Service> tip <END>  to my  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  to guarantee  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  got something out of us. My aunt told me  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  because Vegas really has know gauranteed customer returns  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no need to try to impress the customer. SO TRUE.  I do not recommend anyone eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at FIX. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pricey and really didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  great.  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:Service> horrible <END>  to say the least and if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  gives a 1/2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  I would have choosen  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .
My first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ! My children kept talking about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are 19 years old with huge  <START:F_Appetizer> appetites <END>  and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  fits the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . I had the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with the absolute best  <START:F_FoodItem> okra <END>  ever as a side. My son had the monster  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with BBQ atop and  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was too tall to  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . I grazed off their  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> . Can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go again. Well  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END> .....yum yum.
 <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  about what you would expect at a  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>   <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> . We ate twice on our trip  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> steel cut oats <END>  both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>  was good. No kids  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so both of my kids had regular  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  on first  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  should have shared one and still would have had one  <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>  left over. Took the  <START:Food> leftovers <END>  and used  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  as  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END>  as we walked the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> . The second visit  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  shared a  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> .
absolutely delicious . I am glad I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  early in my vacation ,so I can go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again . I had the  <START:Food> cheesy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelette <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ranch   potatoes   <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> banana nut muffin <END> .  I was looking at the stuffed strawberry French toast, no really I literally was staring at  <START:Food> it <END> , the lady probably thought I was a creeper, but I am getting  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sometime this week, with a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> ranch   potatoes   <END> .  However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  sounds good too...I did not get to stare at  <START:Food> it <END>  to report back...sorry.  Whatever you do... <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ranch   potatoes   <END> !!
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is by far the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  i've ever been to!!
I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!  Very good  <START:Food> food <END>  at reasonable  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END> .  Be prepared for a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  with large groups and at peak  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:Food> it <END> .
What the hell Tom Colicchio?!?!?!  My blindfolded cats can make a better  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> !  I'd give  <START:Food> it <END>  -5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  but I can't. Hubs and I were at the  <START:A_Places> pool <END>  and wanted some  <START:Food> food <END> .  Since we've been  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  fans of Tom on Top Chef we thought we'd give  <START:Food> it <END>  a try.  We weren't  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END>  by the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  ( <START:Food> it <END>  is on the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> , after all) and expected the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  to be top notch.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the slow roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  I should've known this was going to be a problem when I didn't see the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheddar <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  said "aged  <START:F_FoodItem> cheddar <END> " on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , why wasn't  <START:Food> it <END>  on my sammie??   Ehhhh, I wasn't going to walk all the way back to the  <START:A_Places> eatery <END>  from the  <START:A_Places> pool <END> .  I thought to myself, "I can deal, I'm sure the  <START:F_FoodItem> rest <END>  will be yummy".  Boy was I wrong.  If you like some  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  with a sliver of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and a pound of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for you!   I'm pretty sure the high school kid at subway can assemble a nicer  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  than this.  Not only were  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  thrown together,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was barely any  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ...  not to mention my forgotten  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .   And  <START:Food> it <END>  was sooo salty!  Sorely disappointed, Tom.  How come all the other  <START:Food> food <END>  you make on TV looks so good?  You've really  <START:F_FI_Price> cashed <END>  in on your fame.  I'd write him a note expressing my concern but I know  <START:Food> it <END>  won't reach him and  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's too  <START:A_Env_Type> busy <END>  raking in $$$ to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END> . Looking for a good  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> ?  Try Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  at Planet Hollywood.
I am across the country and cannot believe how much I miss Manolo's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> empanadas <END> ! <START:F_FoodItem> empanadas <END> :So many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> ! My favorites are the  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Stay away from the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> thyme <END> , I thought  <START:Food> it <END>  was awful. I haven't tried their  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> empanadas <END> :  <START:F_Dessert> brownie <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . The san telmo  <START:Food> anything <END>  is okay if you want more of " <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END> "  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> :The BBQ Meats  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is why I can never become  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END> ! Imagine a super thin  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  crust where BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  substitutes marinara  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Then add  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> , ground  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> . Mmmmmm....You had me at  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> .I've also enjoyed their other specialty slices.I also have to give credit to Manolo's for having great  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  crust. The thinness of  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> toasts <END>  so well in the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  oven  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you have to hold yourself back from inhaling the entire slice in five  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> :Limited  <START:A_Places> indoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  and a few  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  when the weather is nice. I suggest taking your  <START:Food> food <END>  and sitting in the Krannert  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> theater <END> .
awesome  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat. I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  regularly on my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  break in the  <START:Service> service <END>  is always  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  I recommend asking  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  to ' <START:F_Ingredients> mix <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  up' for you once your burro is done  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> mix <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  all up before  <START:F_FoodItem> wrapping <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  :)
Very good  <START:Food> food <END> !! Try the fundido  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> !
Don't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  attention to the snob reviewers. No,  <START:Food> it <END> 's not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Phoenix. If you have to have the best of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>   <START:Restaurant> everywhere <END>  you go then  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  says all we need to know about you.If  <START:Food> it <END> 's  <START:A_Env_Type> busy <END> ,  you're going to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  We call  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  "science". I really liked my  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I have eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Last trip I spotted someone eating some really good looking  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> . I'll have to try  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .Come for a  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ,  a good  <START:Food> meal <END> ,  interesting  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and a great  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  at night.
I've been coming to Chloe's Corner since  <START:Food> it <END>  opened back in the day as "The  <START:A_Places> counter <END> ."   <START:Food> it <END>  is probably one of my favorite  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spots in the  <START:A_Places> area <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  is quick, yet relaxed...and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is perfect.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a plethora of  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  I've tried gets my seal of approval.  I usually always get the Classic  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  along with a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of their  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  I don't know what  <START:Food> it <END>  is about this  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , because their really is nothing out of the ordinary about  <START:Food> it <END> , but damn  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are so good.  Dip  <START:Food> it <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  is a bit of heaven (or your childhood...).  When I feel like switching  <START:Food> it <END>  up, I'll usually get the  <START:F_Ingredients> chinese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is shredded and the  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END> -soy) is so delish....I usually end up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  an extra side of the  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  because I like  <START:Food> it <END>  so much.If you are in the Kierland/Scottsdale Q  <START:A_Places> area <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> , do not hesitate one bit to come into Chloe's Corner for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .   <START:Food> it <END> 's quick, affordable, and tasty.
My  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  has left me with no words. Bad  <START:Service> service <END> . Mediocre  <START:Food> food <END> . I can definitely say I'm never coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.  <START:Food> it <END>  took over 20  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>  to get our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  some  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  didn't own up to  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  mistakes and blamed the busboy for not bringing the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . When we got the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END>  tasted  <START:Service> horrible <END> . Our  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  sink  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better than  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  came so late as if  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  left to catch the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  we were going to consume. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  then forgot to put in one of our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and apologized in the most stand offish way possible saying  <START:Food> it <END>  was a "human error" as if  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  wasn't even sorry about  <START:Food> it <END> . As we received the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> , my friend realized  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  got spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  when  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail <END> . All in all worst  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ever! The only  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:S_Staff> person <END>  was the busboy. Avoid the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  with a feather tattoo behind  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  ear.
We had a great  <START:Service> work <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were about 20 of us and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  did a great job timing the courses.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was nothing extraordinary.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the New York  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  could've used a little more  <START:F_Ingredients> marbling <END> .   The  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END>  we got before the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was the best thing I ate the whole night.  One annoying thing at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END> /cold you couldn't use  <START:Food> it <END>  on the  <START:F_Drinks> soft <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  Get with  <START:Food> it <END> .
This is a  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  local  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .   <START:Food> it <END> 's a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when you want Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  but want a step up from fast  <START:Food> food <END>  or casual quick.  I will say, however, on both of my visits, my  <START:Food> meal <END>  was good but arrived at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  barely  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> warm <END> .  Would have been better had my  <START:Food> meals <END>  been  <START:Service> served <END>  hot.   <START:Food> dinner <END>  for 2 including  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:Service> tip <END>  was just over $40.00.
Very good  <START:Food> food <END> . We are  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . And both of us  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  curry and  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  tandoori.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are fantastic. But I don't like the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are too sweet for me.
So, i went to see Javier Colon in  <START:A_Entertainment> concert <END>  on Tuesday night....which i had been  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for an opportunity to see him perform  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> live <END>  since 2004, so i was stoked about going. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:O_Reservation> tickets <END> , which were  <START:O_Reservation> front row <END>  btw, at a  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  for  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>   <START:O_Reservation> reserved <END> ...not bad for $38 per  <START:O_Reservation> ticket <END>  i thought. I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  a week and a half for my  <START:O_Reservation> tickets <END>  to make their journey through the mail, but still nothing, even on the day of the  <START:A_Entertainment> concert <END> , nada! I called and was told  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  would be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  at will call for me, so i  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  up after struggling to find a  <START:S_Seating> sitter <END>  for my daughter and the  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  drive from Queen Creek, only to just be escorted to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> , no  <START:O_Reservation> ticket <END>  stub for a keepsake or  <START:Food> anything <END> (AWESOME #1....not). We get to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and not only are the  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  i  <START:O_Reservation> reserved <END>  not empty, but apparently  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  thought i'd be cool with letting someone else  <START:S_Seating> sit <END>  in one of our  <START:O_Reservation> reserved <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  and myself or my wife just slide over one. Well,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  would have been cool if i wanted my head right next to a PA system, and to krank my neck up like i was talking to Shaq for 3 hours, but not only do i like my hearing, but i also have a bulging disc in my neck....(AWESOME #2!). When we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END>  took roughly 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came to speak with us even to ask us if we wanted a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  or  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> ...sure why not....my wife and i decide  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we will each get one  <START:Food> item <END> , i was gonna get a  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was getting a  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> , since we had just eaten  <START:Food> dinner <END>  while on the way to the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> . About 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END> , a different  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  approached us, we gave our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ...only to be told  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we must both  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  2  <START:Food> items <END>  minimum, otherwise  <START:Food> it <END>  will be an additional $10 per  <START:S_Staff> person <END> (Awesome #3) I'm pretty sure i  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for my  <START:A_Entertainment> concert <END>   <START:O_Reservation> ticket <END> , not a  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> ...thanks though, not so much!We finally just got fed up so  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we told the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  we were not going to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  any  <START:Food> item <END> , only to be told, rudely i might add,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  states such on the  <START:O_Reservation> ticket <END>  stub(which once again we hadn't received). Obviously not an issue i could help  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  with, especially seeing as how their was barely even walking  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for anyone over 95 lbs. Crowded is a good thing for a  <START:A_Entertainment> concert <END> , but do you really want the assortment of  <START:Food> food <END>  smells and  <START:F_Drinks> liquors <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  with the other customers bad breath as the scent of a date night. ( <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's #4!)After the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  was over, right as we were in the process of getting up from our  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  to make our way to the  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END> , our original  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  approaches us, immediately apologizing for the other  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> actions <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> tone <END> . We stated  <START:Food> it <END>  was fine but we will definitely never be going back. For being nice, so to speak...i'd rather stick to real venues... <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  actually are about  <START:Service> service <END> , not  <START:F_FI_Price> dollars <END> ...one thing i have learned in my life... <START:Service> treat <END>  people right, be  <START:Service> treated <END>  right....No  <START:Service> tip <END>  FOR YOU!.
I have heard so much about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , so I finally tried ifor my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  did not  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> live <END>  up to the hype  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was built.  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Service> decent <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , but not  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> ....$12.99 for a half rotisierre  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Frys gives you a whole one for $5.99 and  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  the same. I guess I was  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for the  <START:Food> dish <END>  soap used to wash the LARGE  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> ...so large,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so much  <START:A_Places> space <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . Just saying, if I am going to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>   <START:O_Payment> charged <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> , I expected MUCH better. I still may go, if someone can convince me I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the wrong  <START:Food> item <END> .
 <START:Food> it <END> 's fine.  No, really,  <START:Food> it <END> 's fine.Seriously,  <START:Food> it <END> 's fine.I'm not being sarcastic,  <START:Food> it <END> 's fine.__________________________________(this is just for the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> , which I've had 10-15  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  since I usually stay  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  when I come to Pittsburgh)
Day after thanksgiving me and my buddy thought we would have  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  at Chompies. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was crowded but we got  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  right away. At first glance  <START:Food> it <END>  looked like any other major deli, but after seeing the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  I saw  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a different kind of  <START:S_Menu> selection <END> . Wanting to try a something new I went for the famous "Original Jewish sliders" as featured on Man vs  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are 2 pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> challah <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> latka <END>  and and  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END> , topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  was great, and  <START:Food> it <END>  was super filling. I don't know how  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  had 11 of  <START:S_Staff> them <END> . I was full after 3.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are packed and rich with  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . My friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Spanish  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  said  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't very good, but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  finished  <START:Food> it <END>  cause  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was hungry. Overall I would have to try more  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to really judge this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was pretty good, and  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> , but a lot of the  <START:Food> food <END>  just looks average.
 <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious. I had the Vegenini,  <START:Food> it <END>  is like a  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . I loved  <START:Food> it <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:Food> fries <END>  are also delicious. Customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is always  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .
Brian and his  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are very  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .  The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and other  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are fantastic.  I highly recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END> 's AMAZING.
While not inedible, I don't think the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavors <END>  were at all authentic. We tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  curry,  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  korma and tandoori  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Of these, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tandoori and v. Korma were best. The  <START:F_FoodItem> nan <END>  was  <START:Service> decent <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END> , even at medium, is not at all spicy.
We had the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is awesome.  However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  was way too salty.   <START:Food> it <END>  was so salty  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  ruined a good piece of good  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .  We should have taken  <START:Food> it <END>  back, but we were too tired  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we wanted to go back to our  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> broccolini <END>  was plain and the mash  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  was just ok.
Went to this  <START:Restaurant> spot <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the Putt Park. Sadly Putt Park was a huge let down, but thankfully the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was YUMMY!We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a little bit of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was great. We were pretty much the only  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  which can lead to  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  being all over you or nowhere in sight but not our  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  :) I will definitely go back.
We only went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  because we had a  <START:S_Gift> gift certificate <END> . The caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  had been sitting in  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  too  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  and was wilted, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> croutons <END>  were so  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END>  I nearly broke a tooth! My daughter, who is 13, said  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  basic alfredo  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was "disgusting", and I have to admit  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  was pretty gross, swimming in  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>  and completely lacking any  <START:F_Ingredients> seasonning <END> . My husband's  <START:F_Drinks> tequila <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was very bland. But my  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> , surprisingly, were very good! The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is all over the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ? Lebanese? American/? Mexican? We don't know! WIll we go back? Probably not.
my husband and I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> oeufs fameux <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> fromage <END>  and  Benedict montreal smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are quite good.  Better than the same  <START:Food> food <END>  in other  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .If I have to say what are not perfect on our  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  are the  <START:F_FoodItem> patates rissolees <END>  and the Hollandais  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .The tates of the ppotatos are good and  <START:Offers> special <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END>  and some kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .  But  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are  too much minced.  I think  <START:Food> it <END> 's because  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> over-boiled <END> .  And we figure out  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  might make the Hollandais  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  by themselves, the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is way too rich, you will feel very stuffed after eating two Benedict  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> .And I'm  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:O_Payment> charged <END>  for the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  which other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  seem don't do. We  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $35  <START:O_Payment> tax <END>  included for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .    <START:Food> it <END> 's an enjoyable  <START:Food> meal <END>  anyhow.  We will go back again.
Would give  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's not fair as I'm a  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>  now... So this review is solely based on the  <START:Food> fries <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a small  <START:F_FoodItem> fry <END>  to go and noticed  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  scooped the  <START:Food> fries <END>  out of a metal  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  wasn't even being heated.. The  <START:Food> fries <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and barely  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> warm <END> . I requested  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  said  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  didn't offer  <START:Food> it <END>  except for with  <START:F_FoodItem> poutine <END> ?!?!  But I don't really eat  <START:F_FoodItem> dairy <END>  so I just wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  and would  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  extra.. Nope  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  refused to sell me  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> . I only had a few  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  as the  <START:Food> fries <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and then when I got home (TMI sorry) I rushed to the  <START:F_FI_Healthy> bathroom <END> . I guess my system rejected this  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> .PS- no A/C during 33 degree weather.Gave an extra  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  as I'm a  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  eater and feel somewhat biased reviewing a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint.
 <START:Food> it <END> 's a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and very customer- <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> . I loved the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  separation in the same pot (caters to different  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> : check). You are immersed in vapors and you come out feeling very full. I enjoyed almost  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  I put on my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> , but when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is crowded the  <START:Food> food <END>  can get  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  up on the shelves. I really like  <START:Food> it <END> .
I have been coming to Casanova Brothers for about 2 years and I can honestly say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I've never had less than an exceptional  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  remember your name, ask about your  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> , and genuinely  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  about each customer's  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . The Sicilian  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is great, thick but never  <START:Food> doughy <END> , and  <START:Food> crunchy <END>  with the perfect amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . However, the white  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is what keeps me coming back! You can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  by the slice or get the whole  <START:F_FoodItem> pie <END> , and my staple  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  on the white  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  are  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> . A must try!  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is  <START:A_Environment> inviting <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are excellent. If you are a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  snob, you will find no better  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  around!
The best Ive had in a  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> !  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:Service> treated <END>  us like  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was wonderful. Finally a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  w/ island style  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  and  <START:S_Menu> recipes <END> ! I will be using the  <START:Service> service <END>  I just received as a model for the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I manage. Thanks Island  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> 
Great  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  with great  <START:Service> service <END> ! Always happy with the  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> . Keep up the good  <START:Service> work <END> !!
Awesome  <START:Service> service <END> . Awesome  <START:Food> meal <END> . Lobster Pot  <START:F_FoodItem> pie <END>  still the best  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  ever, but should be shared. If you like Kale, the Kale Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is Unbelievable
being korean i've learned  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  i cannot go a few days without eating korean  <START:Food> food <END>  i really don't know why, but  <START:Food> it <END> 's something  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  i have to have within days. so i realized ginseng 3 opened about 6 months ago and my mom and i decided to go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:A_Environment> new years eve <END> . we had the mandu duk guk (dumpling  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ) because  <START:Food> it <END> 's  <START:F_FI_Religious> tradition <END>  to eat  <START:Food> it <END>  on new years ( <START:S_Del_Time> long <END>  life or good luck...idk something like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> ) and  <START:Food> it <END>  was good!!! i'm only giving  <START:Food> it <END>  a 4 because i haven't had  <START:Food> anything <END>  else  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but i will definitely update next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i go back :)
Gotta say I was  <START:O_Experience> surprised <END>  at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ...I maybe a frequent customer. <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  rub the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  then add a  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on top of  <START:Food> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was just about falling off the  <START:F_FoodItem> bone <END>  and good. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , frankly I gotta try  <START:Food> it <END>  again.  <START:Food> it <END>  was good I just couldn't get a feel for  <START:Food> it <END> . Not spicy, a little sweet with smokyI also got a pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , yes I did get a half a rack and a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , what, big man gotta eat!  The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  where good I tried eat one. The  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>  based one had a kick to  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I'm gonna venture and try again.I asked about the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  don't keep  <START:Food> it <END>  on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  just for the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> .Only bad part was how the  <START:Service> served <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  beard in  <START:S_Cutlery> aluminum foil <END>  for some reason  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  reminded me of school  <START:Food> lunch <END>  back in the day. I ate  <START:Food> it <END>  though!I'll be back at the Rock Store and we'll update when I've got a clearer  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> . A solid 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  on the Que for now.
my bf made  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  a month or so back for our valentines day  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ..since we had a great  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at our anniversary  <START:Food> dinner <END>  (read my other review for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> !)we were standing at  <START:A_Places> podium <END>  for a good 10mins b/c  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was noone  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ...so i eyed someone in the  <START:Restaurant> resturant <END>  to have  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  someone come over to help us...we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for 5mins in their lil  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>   <START:A_Places> area <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ...and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great but as amazing as  <START:Food> it <END>  was last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  though. we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , i  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  hot sour  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  since  <START:Food> it <END>  is def yummy, and we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tenderloin <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shredded pro <END>  and shared both  <START:Food> dishes <END> ...boy! we were full!  <START:Food> it <END>  was delicious and i recieved a rose since  <START:Food> it <END>  was vday :) so  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was a great gesture!my bf and i would come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  yet again..since its prob the only few  <START:Restaurant> resturants <END>  we would drop  <START:O_Pay_Price> money <END>  for  <START:Food> food <END>  on...of  <START:S_Menu> course <END>  for a  <START:Offers> special <END>  occasion though aha
"Never judge a book by its cover". This is one of  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>  small  <START:A_Places> gems <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  people might not give a 2nd look.  <START:Food> it <END> 's a free standing  <START:Ambience> building <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  has had its share of  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  tenants. If a buddy hadn't told me about Luu's, I might never have spotted  <START:Food> it <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  fresh, and  <START:Food> it <END>  is GOOD!  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  are my favorites. Very casual, fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> , but definitely dine-in  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . Tam and Christy are very  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a convenient drive-thru, also. CHECK  <START:Food> it <END>  OUT!
1  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  of  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  should be enough for 4 small people or 2 large people
Sooo, my rating isn't really regarding the  <START:Food> food <END> . I've been twice-  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  until after the 2nd  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to Yelp to give  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  a fair chance but really wanted to share my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to possibly save somebody else from the hassle.... Both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  weren't amazing but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  certainly weren't terrible either. My biggest  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  is with the  <START:Service> service <END> . BOTH  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  we had suuuuuuuper slow  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> . Both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  screwed up at least 2  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .  The first  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  gave us the wrong  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , I'm a good patron, I totally expect  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>  happens and I usually give the benefit of the doubt. Well-  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  AGAIN brought the wrong thing. How does one manage to do  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> !?We decided to give  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  another try since  <START:Food> it <END> 's the closer BWW to us and we were totally craving  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Well?  <START:Food> it <END>  was way worse this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  was the same- pretty good.   <START:Service> service <END> ? Sucky.   <START:Food> it <END>  was really odd because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  seemed to be an over abundance of  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  scheduled this particular night and yet the  <START:Service> service <END>  was super slow.  When the  <START:S_Staff> girl <END>  finally came to take our  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> soft <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and my boyfriend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .  So  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  comes back and does get my  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  right, but brings him a completely different  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .  I try to flag  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  down as  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  leaves without even asking if we were good and tell  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END> 's given us the wrong  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . "Oooops! I'll be back!" No lie- at least 5  <START:S_Del_Time> mins <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  finally  <START:A_Entertainment> shows <END>  up with the correct one.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  arrived and this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were no hiccups with the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , so we were just trying to enjoy the  <START:Food> meal <END> . So again I had to flag  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  down for a refill on my  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  and again for the check since we wanted to catch a  <START:A_Entertainment> movie <END> .The check  <START:A_Entertainment> shows <END>  up and I always look to make sure  <START:Food> things <END>  are ok (especially when I can tell the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  is a ditz) and sure enough-  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:O_Payment> charged <END>  us for the incorrect  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  AND the one  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  originally  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and got eventually.  I flag  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  down again and tell  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  about  <START:Food> it <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> apologizes <END>  and says  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 'll fix  <START:Food> it <END> .At this point, my boyfriend had given  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Method> card <END>  to  <START:O_Payment> charge <END>  after  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had fixed the tab. I warned him against  <START:Food> it <END>  because the  <START:S_Staff> girl <END>  was dumb as rocks, but let the inevitable happen. <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> later <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  appears and says  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 's having trouble figuring out how to remove the  <START:O_Payment> charge <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had  <START:O_Payment> charged <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Method> card <END>  before  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  changed the total. Awesome.So now the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  had to come and fix the whole mess and we were FINALLY on our way.We both decided  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we'd  <START:O_Experience> never come back <END>  to this particular  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and try the Gilbert  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  off Gilbert.
I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is so nice and professional. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is awesome,  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a great  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  and their  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are even better.
No lengthy review needed....great  <START:Service> service <END> , perfect (and honest)  <START:S_Menu> suggestions <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and delicious  <START:Food> food <END> . Won't be our last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
In  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of priority given the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and I was not nearly as hungry as my partner in crime:5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  -  <START:A_Places> space <END> ,  <START:A_Decor> layout <END> ,  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  goes on for miles, and the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END>  are sweet..yeah, I said  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .. 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  - the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is great, the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , a downright treat4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  - the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END>  ware is out of this world...where did you get  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> cups <END> , I want one...2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  - the  <START:Service> service <END> , we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  a good 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a... <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:Food> it <END> ...a single  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  with a few  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  at 9:30 in the am on a Saturday...the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was empty with the exception of a few  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  dwellers and a crazy amount of  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .So, RnR you are really really pretty but I can't bring you home to mom and dad because well, like you are not real stable if you know what I mean, but I will  <START:A_Env_Type> party <END>  with you any day!
Super  <START:Service> service <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent, you must try the Swedish  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END> . I really enjoyed Mike and Fletcher, a wealth of knowledge. This is a must stop in  <START:Restaurant> plaza <END>  Midwood.
What a disappointment!I was starving when I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> smoothie <END>  plus boba, and a  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  Club on a  <START:F_FoodItem> croissant <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  and extra  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , then tipped the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END> .  I love  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  and boba, so I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  with high anticipation for a fresh, delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on par with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Lee's popularity suggests.  Imagine my dismay when I instead got a stale, old, tough  <START:F_FoodItem> croissant <END>  with pre-squished  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END> , a minimal amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , and WAYYYYYY too much  <START:F_Ingredients> mayonnaise <END> !Don't bother with the boba either,  <START:Food> it <END> 's really  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END>  and not fresh.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> smoothies <END>  don't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like real fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  either, even though  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  say  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are. Funny, I didn't know  <START:F_FoodItem> jackfruit <END>  could be shipped to Nevada without being frozen. -_-;;  The  <START:F_FoodItem> smoothie <END>  I got didn't even  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like frozen  <START:F_FoodItem> jackfruit <END> ...  <START:Food> it <END>  tasted like a premade  <START:F_Ingredients> flavoring <END>  added to a  <START:F_Ingredients> mix <END> .I should also mention  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was fairly rude while I was  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> , like I was an inconvenience to  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  in showing up and politely expecting  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  to do  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  job for a  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  and a half. I was so hungry when I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I would have accepted even Subway as passible  <START:Food> food <END> .  For me to feel this badly about what  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offered is a pretty abysmal first  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  Due to such a stark lack of redeemable  <START:F_FI_Quality> qualities <END>  I won't be returning... not even at 2 in the morning, not even if every other  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is closed... I'd rather go to a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint, eat a Cliff  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , or starve.
I've studied and had my share of great and authentic Japanese  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> -- <START:Food> it <END> 's as much an  <START:A_Decor> art <END>  as a science.Not bad. Girls are really nice  <START:Restaurant> here <END> --aiming to please.  The  <START:A_Places> space <END>  is clean. <START:Food> it <END>  was great to see  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have the popular dual  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  (tonkotsu-shoyu)  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is quite trendy in Japan.   <START:Food> it <END>  was excellent. Unfortunately the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  are not made  <START:Restaurant> here <END> --what a disappointment.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  was made too far in advance and thus cold and too  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END> .But I didn't expect  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  much out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Vegas, so  <START:Food> it <END>  was a nice  <START:Food> meal <END>  despite the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> .
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has been on my radar for three months now. I finally made  <START:Food> it <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  a few days ago, and I have to say - <START:Food> it <END>  was a disappointing  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  I chose  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> item <END>  F-6 (Spicy Thai Holy  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ) -which was stir fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> , and Thai holy  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  leaves. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  itself was sliced -not ground and was a little tough and  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END> . The  <START:Food> dish <END>  appeared to be swimming in  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END>  -instead of a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I didn't know sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  could be greasy... The level 3  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  out of 5 barely registered as spicy, and as a result the  <START:Food> food <END>  was bland. Why do most Thai  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  skimp on  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> ? I thought this was a  <START:Food> dish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  featured  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END> ?  Instead, I found myself on the hunt looking for  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  underneath the rubbery overcooked  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  itself is clean, quaint, and  <START:A_Environment> inviting <END> . My  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was done in 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  which was nice considering I was on my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  break. However, I would rather  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  took their  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to make sure the  <START:Food> dish <END>  actually tasted good. I won't come back as  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are just too many good Thai  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to choose from in Las Vegas.
I've been to The House at Secret Garden a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for private events. The  <START:A_Places> area <END>  is absolutely gorgeous but their  <START:Food> food <END>  &  <START:Service> service <END>  is just mediocre. One event I went to was in the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  & sun  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> , and the other was in the urban barn. The  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  was very nice but the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  is a standard plain white  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> .  The urban barn is cute from the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  but the inside is a little janky. The  <START:Ambience> ceiling <END>  and  <START:Ambience> beams <END>  are unfinished ugly wood with the manufacturer stamps still visible and spray  <START:A_Decor> painting <END> ... <START:Restaurant> they <END>  could have at least stained  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  a neutral brown.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:A_Decor> faux <END>  wooden  <START:Ambience> beams <END>   <START:A_Decor> painting <END>  on the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END> . Not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  impressive, but the  <START:A_Places> area <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  (we had  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  under the carob tree) is beautiful.The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  is a different story. One of the  <START:Food> meals <END>  was catered by Santa Barabara catering and  <START:Food> it <END>  was fantastic. If you're hosting an event  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , I recommend going with a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  from the catering company. The other  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a  <START:S_Seating> sit <END>  down, pre-selected 3  <START:S_Menu> course <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END> . The  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> / <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  had zero coordination. One  <START:S_Staff> person <END>  out of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  would get their hot  <START:Food> entree <END>  a good 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before anyone else got theirs.  <START:Food> it <END>  was near impossible to get  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and was impossible to get a refill of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . I thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  was disappointing. I had:-  <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> beet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> : By far the best thing I had. Great  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END> , yummy  <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> greens <END> . -  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>  Trio: So small and just okay. The  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END>  was very soggy and the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  jam  <START:Food> it <END>  was topped with was far too sweet for an  <START:Food> entree <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> arancini ball <END>  was delicious but I only got one...for my  <START:Food> entree <END> . If  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  had been 3 then  <START:Food> it <END>  would have been a  <START:Food> meal <END> .-  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  with Fudge, Fleur De Sel  <START:F_FoodItem> caramel <END> , & Buttercream  <START:F_FoodItem> frosting <END> : Amazing sounding description but one of the worst  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  I've ever had. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and barely had a  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was about a tablespoon's  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> frosting <END>  and not even a teaspoon of  <START:F_FoodItem> caramel <END> . So so  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and lacking the richness or  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  of a  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .-  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  Pudding: Much better than the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  but still average.If you're planning on hosting an event at The House at Secret Garden, I recommend trying to make  <START:Food> it <END>  as outdoors as possible (prettiest) and not using their in house catering.
We walked in to Le Comptoir without a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> , and we got a great  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Places> counter <END> , where we could watch all of the hipster-esque  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  beautiful  <START:Food> dishes <END>  all night  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END> . We watched  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  send out  <START:Food> dish <END>  after  <START:Food> dish <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  looked -- and, more importantly, tasted -- delicious. We did not  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> charcuterie <END> , which was probably a mistake, but we did have the  <START:F_FoodItem> beet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> braised <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  loin,  <START:F_FoodItem> porchetta <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ceviche <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ceviche <END>  was probably our least favorite, but we still enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> .  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  also had a great  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list with lots of approachable  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  by the  <START:S_Cutlery> glass <END> , and very knowledgeable  <START:S_Staff> waitstaff <END> . A great  <START:Food> dining <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  all around.
For my fiancee's first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in Vegas  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  insisted on doing a  <START:Food> buffet <END> . Since I was going to be forced into going to one I decided to pick one of the  <START:Service> decent <END>  ones and Wicked Spoon was my first  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> . Really  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't bad (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ), but  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't great either.I sampled the  <START:F_FoodItem> paella <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  was actually ok (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ), and the  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was an interesting addition and not bad (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ), and some of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  were enjoyable (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ), and the overall  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was pretty good (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ).Really though, a lot of  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't  <START:Service> work <END>  in the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  format.  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  in small  <START:Food> dishes <END>  didn't really seem to  <START:S_Seating> sit <END>  well,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> curries <END>  also seemed to suffer. Actually  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  unique about this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  seemed to suffer sitting in the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  format, and the small  <START:Food> dishes <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  and your small  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  seemed to want to force you into multiple trips back to the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  until you just can't be bothered anymore and leave. The good  <START:Food> things <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are the  <START:Food> things <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you see in other (cheaper)  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> . A pile of  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs on your  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> , a gigantic heap of mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , just about  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  from a big communal trough worked (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ).  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was uneven and the  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  left a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth. A greyhound is like $8 (since I guess  <START:Food> it <END>  fits their spirit+mixer format), but a salty  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  which is a greyhound with a  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  rim is somehow 2 or 4  <START:F_FI_Price> dollars <END>  more?  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's some expensive  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .So really what  <START:Food> it <END>  comes down to is if the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is good is the  <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you can get in a  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  format works, and the  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> stuff <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is all kind of mediocre and suffers for sitting in the  <START:A_Decor> heatlamps <END> , what's the point of coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ? I can't really find one.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  being said, if you have someone who really wants to go to a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  and you don't want the usual  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , then this one is ok (for  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ).Edit: My fiancée just informed me the salty  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  was 14  <START:F_FI_Price> dollars <END> (!). I'm never one to complain about  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  can't be any rationale behind  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  other than "You're in Vegas, fuck you."
I took the whole  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  on a Sunday afternoon and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was about a 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to  <START:S_Seating> sit <END>  down.  Figured  <START:Food> it <END>  was a good thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we were not the only ones  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were good and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was super  <START:A_Env_Type> busy <END>  but still took good  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  of us.  We all  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some form of  <START:F_FoodItem> chimichanga <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were all good.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  messed up my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and brought me  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  which was ok because the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  had a little kick to  <START:Food> it <END> .  The kids had minichimis  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had no complaints.  We will definateley be going back.  Maybe next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we will take advantage of happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> .
The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is great.I love  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  Just  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> , a locally roasted fair trade, organic  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is  <START:S_Delivery> delivered <END>  by bicycle.   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  use organic and locally  <START:F_Ingredients> sourced <END>  products for their other  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  as well.Nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , with an open air  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  on the east side in the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> warm <END>  months.The  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  for  <START:Service> service <END>  can be  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  move quickly and the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  is never very  <START:S_Del_Time> long <END> .The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  seem reasonable for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  - the old "you get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for" matra!
Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing,  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is really nice, and the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  (Luke) is fantastic.  My friends and I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  often and we love  <START:Food> it <END> .
Yummy  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , great  <START:A_Entertainment> entertainment <END> , welcoming  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and good  <START:Service> service <END> 
Periodically I go in search of a good local  <START:Food> diner <END>  for just a good  <START:Food> meal <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the perfect  <START:A_LocatedArea> small town <END>   <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> .  <START:Food> it <END> 's not  <START:A_Decor> fancy <END> , the  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  don't match  <START:Food> it <END> 's just a simple  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  and I love  <START:Food> it <END> ! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is great,  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick and  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  is good! I will be bringing my friends and  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  from out of town after a night of too much fun.
We just came back from this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  tonight. We really enjoyed our  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at this tiny Ethiopian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was full of flavour.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offered extra Injera for no extra  <START:O_Payment> charge <END> . We had the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  combo and a  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  which turned out to be a little too much  <START:Food> food <END>  for us- we are stuffed right now! And the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END> , $31 including  <START:O_Payment> tax <END> !  <START:Food> it <END>  was really reasonable for the huge  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  we got. The 2  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were so nice.  <START:Food> food <END>  came out fast and we were impressed with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> it <END> . We will be back!Disclaimers and other notes:  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is basic, but  <START:Food> it <END>  seems like  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> . We would have taken  <START:Food> it <END> , but  <START:Food> it <END> 's too cold tonight.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  did not really have  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:S_Menu> options <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END> , so you may want to opt to plan  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> /sweets into your evening  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . This is not  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  poeple eat with  <START:S_Cutlery> utensils <END> - A lady near our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  suggested many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  MUST get  <START:S_Cutlery> forks <END> . And when  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  tried to explain his cultural  <START:F_FI_Religious> tradition <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was all: Ya, but you really need  <START:S_Cutlery> forks <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was kind of hilarious. Enjoy!
This brewery is pretty dope. I like the IPA's but I'd stay away from  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> . Good  <START:Service> service <END> , looks more like a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Overall a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to chill and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .
The best Soul  <START:Food> food <END>  hands down! I got the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  wi th  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  n  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .....  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  kill  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> 
Best Rueben in town! I take my ruebens seriously, i judge a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on  <START:Food> it <END> . If you mess up a rueben you're dead to me. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was great and I liked the overall feel of the  <START:Ambience> establishment <END> .
Wow! We had the Hell's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  & Sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:Food> fries <END> , American  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  & Truffle  <START:Food> fries <END> .  If you eat nothing else for the  <START:F_FoodItem> rest <END>  of your life make  <START:Food> it <END>  the Sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:Food> fries <END> .
Had high expectations from all the great reviews from Yelp. I know  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>  tend to be salty (though I've eaten at a few  <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  weren't), and this was no exception.  If the  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was flavorful, I couldn't really tell because the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  content drowned out all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  base and my gf had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  base. Both were equally salty. I even added a  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of hot  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  to my  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  was still salty.. Ugggh!  And the two slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  I got in my  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was literally more fat than  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .  And now I'm feeling so thirsty..  Definitely not one of the better  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> .   I will not be returning.
The best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  in Phoenix!!!
Customer  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are always excellent. Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we visit Las Vegas we make  <START:Food> it <END>  a point to have  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . We recommend  <START:Food> it <END>  to  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  visits Las Vegas. My husband is very picky when  <START:Food> it <END>  comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  always walks out raving about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  so I know  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  are doing  <START:Food> things <END>  right  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is so good  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  signed up for a Yelp account so  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  personally can give  <START:Food> it <END>  5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  (very unlike him).
I was really looking forward to eating at this  <START:Food> food <END>  truck, but after eating their stir  <START:F_FoodItem> fry <END> , I would have to agree with the other reviewers -its not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  great.   <START:A_Places> portion <END>  was a good size but  <START:Food> it <END>  was pretty bland and needed more  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  Unfortunately, won't be visiting this  <START:Food> food <END>  truck again.
Went back today with the whole  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> ....I have to suggest the  <START:F_FoodItem> al pastor vampiro <END> !   <START:Food> it <END> 's like a  <START:F_FoodItem> tostada <END> , but so much better!  The  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:Food> tortilla <END>  isn't fried, but  <START:Food> it <END>  is crisp, light and not greasy.  A great option for  <START:F_FoodItem> those <END>  who like crunch.  My dad had the  <START:F_FoodItem> carne asada torta <END>  and was really happy.   <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's not a big fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> tortillas <END> , so the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was the perfect  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  for him.   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  thought this was a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many different  <START:S_Menu> options <END> .  Definitely go for the carne asada or al pastor on  <START:Food> anything <END> !
 <START:Food> it <END>  was alright. Nothing  <START:Offers> special <END> . Pretty average.  <START:Food> food <END>  arrived lukewarm, had to heat  <START:Food> it <END>  up for a bit. Way too much  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was very good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  though.
 <START:Food> it <END>  had probably been twenty years since I had tried any  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  on a stick and now I remember why.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  three  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  on a  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> , one on a stick,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders and two  <START:F_Drinks> lemonades <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came to OVER $30.  Okay.Let me start by saying I've never felt more ripped off in my life.  Tiny shriveled  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  and third-rate  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .  I mean seriously, if the  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  were $0.99 instead of $3.85 I might not be writing this...but  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  weren't.  Likewise, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was thickly  <START:F_FoodItem> breaded <END>  and looked like  <START:Food> it <END>  had been deep fried some weeks ago and merely heated up...in fact, I'm nearly sure  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is how  <START:Food> it <END>  was.  The actual " <START:F_FoodItem> hotdog <END>  on a stick" we got, according to my wife, was fine.I will give  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  high marks on their fine  <START:F_Drinks> lemonades <END> .   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were tasty and great.In short, I would have to be starving and this be literally the last  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on earth before I'd go back.   <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  bad...and a horrific value proposition, especially when you consider the excellent Costco  <START:F_FoodItem> hotdogs <END>  just a few miles away.I predict this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  will  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  down within less than a year -  <START:Food> it <END>  is a weird  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  with a weird drive-thru and inadequate signage.
A great addition to this  <START:A_Places> area <END> . The  <START:Food> dining <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  areas were nice and well kept. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were extremely helpful and  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> . I love  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> protein <END> , or green style as  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  called  <START:Food> it <END> . Their  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  custard was heavenly! We will go back.I wish  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:Food> fries <END> !
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> gyros <END>  in the world customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is great I would really recommend ALS Chicago Finest  <START:F_FoodItem> gyros <END> !!!!! Good  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  and yummy
 <START:Food> food <END>  was mediocre at best, and overpriced. Rotating  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  on  <START:S_Cutlery> cask <END>  is a great idea, but half a pint for the pint  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  just seems wrong.  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was nice,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were only for other  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  while we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Can't see making a return visit.
Pulling up to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  the 1st good indicator, lotsa Indians  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  with obvious full & happy bellies. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  could've been any  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Nothing Indian abou  <START:Food> it <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's fine.  <START:Food> it <END>  was clean & didn't smell like sweaty feet.The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is just a few tems & I tasted  <START:S_Staff> them <END>  all. Very good! The  <START:F_FoodItem> nan <END>  was great & plentiful & the  <START:Service> service <END>  efficient.  BUT the draw if this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> it <END> 's really inexpensive...$7. I'll keep this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in mind at the end of the month & needing to rob the coin jar.
Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  is tucked in a small  <START:Restaurant> plaza <END>  off the  <START:F_FoodItem> strip <END>  in Chinatown. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great and the lady who took our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was incredibly  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  is interesting to see the 3 different  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  base  <START:F_FoodItem> ramens <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  offered. This was how each  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  was described to us by the waitressKome  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  (Hokkaido style) - their best selling flavorShiro  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  (Kyoto Style) - very similar to your regular  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  soupRight side is Mame  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  (Nagoya Style) - "bold" flavorSoup was flavorful and filling.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  have a monthly  <START:Offers> special <END>  and this month's was free  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  add-on. The other add-ons were additional  <START:O_Payment> charge <END>  (like  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> ), but  <START:Food> it <END> 's not a big deal for me.At the end of our  <START:Food> meal <END> , we were offered free lychee  <START:F_Dessert> ice cream <END>  and stamp cards. If i lived closer to Vegas, I would definitely come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again.
This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  rocks!  Found this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on Yelp coz I was craving for Asian  <START:Food> food <END>  and my white business partner was craving for  <START:F_FI_Quality> hard <END>   <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END> .  Great happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>  is great and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are legit.   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is the bomb and the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  really is upbeat.   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is really  <START:A_Env_Type> friendly <END> .  This is a new go-to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for me.
Last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went, we were given poor banchan while the two  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  next to us received much higher  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  banchan (?) We got  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  and some  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> , while  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , kimch radish,  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, etc. Why???? Also kept hearing the lady in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  "found the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> " after overhearing the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  tell the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  next to us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> they <END>  were out of spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> . How do you lose the  <START:Food> food <END>  in your  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> ?! I had apparently  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the last  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , but I was extremely  <START:F_FI_Quality> dry <END>  and overcooked.The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are also a bit unreasonable. The nengmyn-kalbi combo comes with a good  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  but literally 4 pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Probably won't be returning  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a while.
I love  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and Go. The delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and nice  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  make my day.  Eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is making me more  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END> .    <START:Food> it <END> 's a very convenient drive through with  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> .   <START:Food> it <END> 's clean and the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  about us.  The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  was patient with me when I asked about organics.  <START:Restaurant> they <END>   <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  large filling  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  for an inexpensive  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> .As a single  <START:S_Staff> person <END>  who has fresh  <START:Food> food <END>  spoil in the  <START:A_Furniture> refrigerator <END> , I would like to divert my whole grocery budget to  <START:S_Staff> them <END> .
Mean  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , as usual.  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in the new Forum  <START:Food> food <END>  Court at Caesars Palace. I grab Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I go to Vegas so I was excited to see another one open. My  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  was shopping at the Forum  <START:Restaurant> shops <END>  and needed a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . We decided to eat at the  <START:Food> food <END>  court we passed by on our way to the  <START:Restaurant> shops <END> . Little did I know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the Forum  <START:Food> food <END>  Court opened  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  very day.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  BLT on  <START:F_FoodItem> wheat <END> . Loved how  <START:Restaurant> they <END>  used crumbled  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END>  strips. Every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  had the right amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  can make just about any  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  better. The balance between the  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> mayonnaise <END>  was just right which really put this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  over the top for me. <START:Service> service <END>  with a smile and no  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> lines <END>  during this visit. Hope  <START:Food> it <END>  stays  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  way. Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , conquering Caesars Palace.

Another overdone  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and utterly inattentive  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.So, we finally got the attention of a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  who was not our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Michael.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was kind enough to take my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  back to the kitchen. Michael, our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , finally shows up 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  have now been sitting empty for 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  makes an appearance and brings me a strip  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  looks rare from the sight of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . He informs me  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's, you guessed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  apologizes again and asks me if I want to take  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  rare but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a cheap cut of strip  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's  <START:food> meal <END>  and we left. I never hope for people to lose  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  jobs but the cook and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  Applebee's again.

Worst drive thru  <START:Service> service <END>  ever.... <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't tell me the total cost of my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  till I got up to the window.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took a couple mins. before anyone even came to the window, and then I had to sit  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for almost 10 mins before I got my  <START:Food> food <END> .  A drive thru is suppose a little quicker  <START:Service> service <END>  of getting your  <START:Food> food <END> .  And the  <START:Food> food <END>  was not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  I  <START:O_Pay_Method> paid <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is not the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I've had  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  kind of  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  The people working  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  also don't seem like  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  want to be  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I don't know why I even tried going back.

Canyon  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  is in the top five of favorite  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to eat. My fiance and I recently celebrated our anniversary at Canyon  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> .  Pro: The  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  rock my world! The  <START:F_FoodItem> entree's <END>  are delicious! The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and efficient.  The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is quiet and relaxed.Con: The carnitas tacos are very greasy.Canyon  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  exceeds our expectations every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  You go for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  but you stay for the  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> .  The chip basket includes sweet potato, blue corn, wonton, and  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  tortilla  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  is roasted and heavenly.  Recommended: The bison  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is juicy and flavorful. The Verde  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchiladas, love the sauce and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is tender.  The top shelf margarita, suggested to share but make sure to stir or the tequila will go straight to your head.Can't wait to go back.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's our little secret  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we enjoy because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's quiet and we usually leave feeling quite euphoric.

The Brioche french toast  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 're advertising now is amazing! <START:Service> service <END>  was quite good; I've been here before and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  isn't always good.Clean enough.  Decent  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> .

Amazing  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's authentic Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  pseudo mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  catered towards gringos like some  <START:Restaurant> places <END> .   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was cool  <START:Ambience> looking <END>  with nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  are served fresh and hot with tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchiladas will change your life. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chile relleno <END>  is great too. The  <START:F_Dessert> churro ice cream <END>  desert is A1.   <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  is very reasonable.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came to 34$ for 2 with  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> horchata <END>  was tasty too.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  were fantastic. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were HUGE. Great  <START:Food> portions <END> . Fair  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . I'll be back.

Why, oh, why is Teppanyaki such a challenge!?!   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is the ultimate in party cuisine and a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , plus the  <START:Food> food <END>  seems  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  much better cooked in front of you.  Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .My nephew is an Asian  <START:Food> food <END>  junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and Sakana remained one of two  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in town we have not tried so onward...We were sat immediately about 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  prior to our  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  and quickly  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> .  After reading other reviews I walked over to the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and looked at the day's specials.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna roll <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was nothing wrong with any of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  had a clean  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  and was very good.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a pleasant surprise.The teppan started with a decent  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  The show itself was good, not great.  The  <START:Food> portions <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  as Teppan  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  I always feel has the best  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  from my perspective as a non  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  eater, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like typical  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .So basically the whole  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the  <START:Service> service <END> .  Lackadaisical is the word  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  comes to mind.    My sister said  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  felt  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  I mentioned having and how many  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  means!  I had to ask to get water and  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took a good 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for my sister's beverage to come from the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was almost an hour before the teppan  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  came over.  The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  though was personable enough  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the non- <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  was less irritating than  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't a bad  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is not  a bad choice.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has hands down the best healthy options EVER!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is not your typical pancake, egg and hashbrown  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  only lets you sub toast for sausage. No.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is legit alternative choices to keep your heart healthy and your body unbloated by sodium.Why do I say  <START:Restaurant> this <END> ?  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> . Want whole wheat  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> ? Ok. Want whole wheat with organic flax seed, organic agave syrup,  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END> , almond, and a shot of protein powder in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ? OK!!!!! I kid you not,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a mind blowing amount of options for your  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> . At addition  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> , of course :).My boyfriend got a healthy plate of  <START:Food> fruit <END>  (nice and fresh) an egg white scramble with turkey, and a side of whole wheat  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  (for just a dollar more!) and I got a plate full of huge  <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  (cuz I'm a fatty). The  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  were unfortunately not to my liking as some were over cooked to the point of being burned, and others were still raw. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> , however, were pretty good.With our room key we got a 10% discount and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  all came out to 17$ before the tip.

Wonderful  <START:Service> service <END>  especially if u get Beth   Everything outstanding to include the hot bean dip to start things off.

Another tourist  <START:A_Environment> spot <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not about the  <START:Food> food <END>  as much as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is about the novelty and character. Fun  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  for kids and families!And, even if you've been  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  a million  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , SOMEONE ought to wear a tie just for giggles.

I don't understand why  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only gets a 3.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  in general reviews because I have become a HUGE SWEET TOMATOES FAN of the Tempe  <START:Ambience> location <END>  in a matter of 3 months.Before I moved to Tempe, I knew about Sweet Tomatoes only because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was my vegan friend's shrine and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  suggested a double date  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Well, at  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I visualized  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  as a buffet with unappetizing lettuce leafs and drippy  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  dressing, like the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in a university cafeteria  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I never visited. Given  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I was generally skeptical of my vegetarian friend's recommendation and particularly skeptical of how good  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> -and- <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  can possibly be, the idea of a double date  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was ... kind of out of the question.Now I have the good fortune of living really close to a Sweet Tomatoes. Now I want to go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , whether  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a single, double, triple, quadruple, or quintuple dates!Things I love about Sweet Tomatoes:1) Seasonally changing  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  features the freshest  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  in season and the low  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  reflects  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . Last month I experienced an Asian-inspired buffet, and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  week is a potato-fest. I like surprises!2) Amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> . I would have to spend 7~10 bucks on some bland, refrigerated boxed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  close to where I work. But why get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  if I can build my own delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , for almost the same  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  (plus other amazing goodies)? The dressing, by the way, is the reason why I don't attempt to make my own  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  at home. 3) Warm, yummy  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> muffins <END> . In  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  serving good  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , I would finish a whole basket of complimentary  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  before my entree. Yes, I am a carb snob and in desperate need of  <START:Food> portion <END>  control when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  comes to carbs. Here, I love the selection of mini-bite, fresh-out-of-the-oven  <START:F_FoodItem> cornbread <END> , orange/cranberry  <START:F_FoodItem> muffins <END> , chocolate brownies, and blueberry  <START:F_FoodItem> muffins <END> . The are the perfect  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> , and give me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside.4) Homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> soups <END> . I love all the Sweet Tomatoe  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soups <END> : the clear-broth chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  noodle  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> , and the creamy  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  wild  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> . I tried the curry lentil  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  and I remember  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  made me very happy. The  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  selection changes every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I go but I think the chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  noodle  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  is a staple.5) Helpful, friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . People are super friendly  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  would walk around and give out a plate of warm and gooey chocolate-chip cookies to  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  where people almost finish with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  not just smile to you, but also talk to you. Each  <START:Food> food <END>  item is labeled clearly with a description of the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , but apparently I can ask for recipes as well!*A side note: the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  really care about  <START:Food> food <END>  hygiene. I noticed one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the lady filling the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  had some mushrooms fell outside the tray.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  didn't put them  back (even though  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were literally on the verge of the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  tray) but threw them away.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is really basic, but I don't think all  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  have trained  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  to do  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .6) Kid-friendly  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . I always lament the fact  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  kids don't eat  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  vegetables. To get them to eat veggies, you probably have to wrap a  <START:F_FoodItem> celery <END>  stick in bacon, put on a  <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk <END>  batter, and deep fry  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  in butter. I think Sweet Tomatoes is helping to change our  <START:Food> food <END>  culture. I am very proud of the kids I have seen at the Sweet Tomatoes who eat a hearty serving of vegetables before digging into the frozen yogurt!Maybe I am writing an unnecessarily long review. But I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  deserves more applause! True,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is not on your Micheline  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  guide, not the one-of-a-kind neighborhood gem, never featured on  <START:S_Staff> man <END>  v.  <START:Food> food <END>  or Triple D, and surely not where you would call for an anniversary  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is simple, fresh, lovely, inexpensive, and best of all, in moderation.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is where I would go for a weekend brunch when I don't want greasiness and excessiveness in my system.

i used to love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but i have noticed the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  in  <START:Food> food <END>  has gone a bit and the rude  <START:Service> service <END>  about always telling my party  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  a reserved and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we only have at least 45 min to eat if we still want to be seated....are u freaking kidding me?! how are the same  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  ALWAYS reserved at "7:30PM"?!?!?! finally someone told me who used to work  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  says  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is just a LIE!  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are NO  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> !!!  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  reserve  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  for people who has a party of 4 or more, so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  doesnt matter if u came first w/ a group of 3 people, the party with 4 or more who comes in after u gets the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . i can't stand  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  rude  <START:Service> service <END>  anymore. read the other comments  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> , see the pattern about the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ??? lol reserve my butt

Busy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has a Mish mash of things, from gyros to lasagne. I had the gyro platter and DH had the gyro and pork kabob platter. First off, the gyro  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  reminds me of  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>  in texture and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was very salty.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  put some kind of gravy on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The Greek  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was good.  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> ...well,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 're  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Signs everywhere saying, "We work for tips." However, aside from bringing the  <START:Food> food <END>  to the table  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  really don't do much to earn a tip. In addition, we  <START:O_Pay_Method> paid <END>  with a card and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't a line for a tip anyway. Overall, tried  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  once. Will not go again.

Good  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is obvious you aren't in a chain  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a big group of friends.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is good, the vibe is super comfortable and since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's already going to be loud and crowded, your group won't stand out much.  I've been here for large group birthdays, and small group hanging out before a night on the town.   <START:Food> food <END>  has always been  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  out quite quickly, and with a big group if you give them the ok  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 'll bring  <START:Food> food <END>  out as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's ready vs. trying to wait for the entire table's  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to be ready. Not only is the  <START:Food> food <END>  good,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  gives you  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  comfort  <START:Food> food <END>  kind of feeling.  Yummy cheesy goodness.

Four Peaks wow. Very tasty  <START:F_FoodItem> grubbins <END> . Went with several friends.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  was calm, casual and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good too, oh yeah, great  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .

If you like lamb you can't go wrong with some Lamb Chops or the Lamb Shank! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent and quick.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is amazing,  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  eggdrop  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  is delicious,  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is extremely friendly and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is to drool for.

hadoken!

New to the area and went for  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  based on the good reviews. Once we went inside we immediately decided to take the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  to go.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so dark and dreary in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  you can barely see. After  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  we decided to get some  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  while we wait. Nothing on tap, but a few craft selections in bottles. We saw you could buy a 6 pack for $8  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  is a killer deal. We got Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and cracked one open.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had gone bad. We asked to change  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out for Alaskan Amber.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  had gone bad too. We ended up throwing the 6 pack away,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I don't do. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was not square as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  boast but round. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  looks nothing like the photos on the outside of the building or on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  website. Small and scarce  <START:F_FoodItem> pepperoni <END>  with a cracker thin  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  you get at an arcade or a bowling alley. My guess is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was frozen. We would have been better off getting a freezer  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and 6 pack from Albertsons across the street. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would have been a lot cheaper. $26 of junk we through out. We would never go back.

Amazing...best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  ever.  Had the bone in ribeye and was outstanding.   <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent,  <START:Food> food <END>  was pricey but  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

By far the most elegant and expensive  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I've ever eaten at.  We made  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  for a Wednesday night, but found  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no need for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a dress code, but I noticed a family walk in with jeans an a sweater but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  still sat them anyway.  Pretty good  <START:Service> service <END> , but you expect  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  at a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END> .  In my opinion though,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  felt a little overbearing.  I couldn't figure out who exactly was our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a different person for each task; wine  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ,  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , drink  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ..a different person who  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  us water, our  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , etc.As far as the  <START:Food> food <END> , incredible.  As an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Bisque  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was smooth and sweet, perfect!  For the entree, I got the vegetable medley and my husband got the Duck.  Both very delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> , I had nothing bad to say about either one.  Nothing felt like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was undercooked or overcooked.  For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , I got the Banana Foster Souffle.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  ever having a souffle, and as far as souffles go, the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is set pretty high.Overall, I enjoyed my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  here.  When coming here though, expect to spend over $100 on a 3-course  <START:Food> meal <END>  for 2.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was AMAZING and of course if you can get a seat outside on the balcony  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no better  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  in Vegas. The wine list is a bit over- <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  wasn't the best as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  forgot us in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  while waiting for a table for over an hour ( <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  wait). Overall though a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and fabulous  <START:Food> food <END> !

Talk about disappointment.  And regret.  We were told by one of our guys  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  Caesar's had a great buffet, and who were we to argue?   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still one of the nicer resorts on the strip.  We got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  Memorial Day morning, and while we weren't surprised  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we got charged the weekend  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a bit weird  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was next to empty.We found out why.  You don't get nearly what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for to come here.  The selection really comes down to the  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet station <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> prime rib <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  cocktails, and  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't much variety in the  <START:Food> foods <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't  <START:S_Delivery> re-supply <END>  quickly enough ( <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a point where was no fresh  <START:Food> fruit <END>  to be found at all!)  Also, even though someone said  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  beats out  <START:F_FI_Size> quantity <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sure sucks when you have to wait in line to get  <START:Food> food <END> .  And really,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  much better than other  <START:Restaurant> places <END> .On its own  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's passable, but with so many better options around for the same  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's really not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to go.

I come here quite often since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's close to work and not too expensive.I love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a couple or reasons.  Consistency and a decent cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  I'm born and raised in AZ so I don't know what a "true" Philly cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like so for me  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is pretty darn good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is always nice and soft and the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  is great with the whiz and onions.   <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are always perfectly crispy and soft on the inside every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  as well but I don't ever seem to be in a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  mood when I go here so I've yet to try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  I'm deducing a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  because the chairs and  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  are in some serious need of replacing and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a lot of dust on the walls and upper ledges above the booth seating.  I've seen enough episodes of cooking shows to know  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  isn't acceptable.  Great  <START:Food> food <END>  though and I will continue to come back!

Not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is below average,  <START:Service> service <END>  is bad, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not anything special.  I would not go back.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are too many great  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  on the strip to go to waste your  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  rinky dink establishment.  The  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are pathetic.  Waited for refills.  My husband had to wait for a new pot of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> which <END>  took 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .  The extra  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  who gets water etc is a joke.  Unfortunately I have no choice to give 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a big 0!

AMAZING! My favorite  <START:Food> meal <END>  of our trip!  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  on. I started out with the Temple  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and my husband the egg rolls. Both were phenomenal! During our stay I had salmon on 3 different nights.. Tao was the best! My husband had Filet mignon  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  melted in your mouth. For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we had  <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate spring rolls <END> ... again.. delicious! And the  <START:F_FoodItem> fortunes <END>  are my favorite. I never tried Tao in NY, but now I am going too! Thank you Tao for an amazing  <START:Food> meal <END> !!

 <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a cold and rainy night. I headed to Vegas for the cure. The cure was Tom Yum  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  from Archi's. The  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  was hot and delicious and hot. Why 2 hots? Because I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  spice level 5 from the option of 1 to 10. As I get older, I find the spice level I'm able to tolerate keeps getting lower.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's a shame...my 18 year old self would laugh at me now. Back to my review. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END> , friendly  <START:Service> service <END>  and reasonable  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a solid 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  in my book.

Went here with a 50% off coupon sold to me by the tix4tonight booth.  I was disappointed. Everything was overcooked and looked unappetizing in general. Actually, the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  taco was good, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and mahi mahi were mediocre at best. The soda  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  funky, to the point where my bf sent his back.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  looks like a fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to drink at night and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have live music and a tropical cabana theme.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  also had a claw machine with live  <START:F_FoodItem> lobsters <END> , (you catch  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  cook  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .)  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 'd probably be a fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go drink with friends. But as far as  <START:Food> dinner <END>  goes, if you're in Vegas, do yourself a favor and eat at one of the other million  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .

Bajio makes me sing "Loco Gringos Like a Party." Okay, so Bajio isn't really where you go to party I was just compelled to use Rev. Horton Heat lyrics in  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review. You could say  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  old joke  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a party in your mouth and  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> 's coming. Except  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the Bajio  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's making the party in your mouth... Um, where is  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  going? Bajio is *Krills! The brightly  <START:A_Decor> painted walls <END>  hold the enormous and very cool  <START:A_Decor> paintings <END>  (Prints?) on the walls, the weathered dangling lamps Bajio's  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  makes you feel as though you should be in San Diego and not next to a Home Depot off of Flamingo.  When you get down to business and make your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the set up is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  station style (like Subway) where you get to pick and chose the variety of beans,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , etc. Everything down to the sour cream is seasoned and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's what makes Bajio different from the other chains of Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  joints.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not authentic but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you can prolly bring those who don't like Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  would eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and you'd be happy to be  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .   *Krills is street for Crack Rock.

Delicious upscale casual fare. Excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . I had the salmon. Overall a very nice  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .

When i walked in here, I felt like I was in a  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  warp.....  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was say  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END>  by someone with little more skill than me..... I would not say inviting or especially welcoming, but......I really enjoyed the  <START:Food> food <END>  here and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is why  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  get the 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> .  The only thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  could have pushed them to a 5 would have been better  <START:Service> service <END>  but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a fantastic Korean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ....Never having had  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  until as an adult, I can tell you in beginning I was not impressed and only ate the Korean BBQ,  but about 28 years ago, I was working in Korea and fell in love with the  <START:Food> food <END> ! <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are three simply reasons to come here and if the three are speaking to you, move on to another  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ...Soondobu - If you like the nice spicy soft tofu  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go!  When yelpers Lisa S. say  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is like  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  mothers pork soondobu or Christopher S give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a good review, I gotta try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  You can pick the spice level.  And, like Lisa says,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  like you expect home made from your mom or grand ma. and Like Christopher S says, you have to do the  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  mouth, or the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  mouth routine to eat  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  properly!Samgyetong - Korean Ginseng  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  - I have spent many a winters in the early days in Korea doing work and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is freezing cold to the bone.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  is so delicious, warming and darn right simple  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  always harkens in my memory the best of Korean dining family or peasant style.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a simple  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .  If you like complex thick  <START:F_FoodItem> soups <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  are overpowering,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  more like hot dishwater to your tastebuds.  However, if you have a delicate palate and very delicate tastebuds, you will know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dishwater of  <START:F_FoodItem> soups <END>  is absolutely more rich and flavorful and refreshing!  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  itself is bland as well,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is boiled in water with minimal herbs, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is so underwhelmingly just right.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is hard to describe.  Simple yet satisfying. I guess  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is like have a grilled cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  Simple yet satisfying....Ban Chan - I love all types of the small  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  of Korean pickled or spiced vegetables and here the selection is the best.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had gobo,  <START:F_FoodItem> celery <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> , white  <START:F_FoodItem> radish <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean sprouts <END> , cubed  <START:F_FoodItem> radish <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> watercress <END> .  Yummy.So, if any of these are speaking to you, gotta get over here. If not, well, you will probably not care too much for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .....GK says....check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out!

Went here for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and had the kafte  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  stuffed in a puffed pita.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was very tasty but I thought  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a bit pricey.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was VERY attentive - my  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  almost ran to the kitchen when he heard  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  ringing for pick up.I will have to go back and see what other  <START:Food> meals <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have, but I think the  <START:Food> food <END>  would be good.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just pricey for what you get.   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is why I am giving  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rather than 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  - value for the money.

Been coming here for years since  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  opened back in 06 because the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  great.  Beats the pants off of Panda Express or Kyoto Bowl because the  <START:Food> food <END>  is made fresh when you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  Super psyched  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the brand has expanded to a few other  <START:Ambience> locations <END>  in the Tempe and Mesa area, hope  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  open shop in Chandler next!

Great  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  joint.Upscale, with a side of small back east  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  joint.  <START:Food> food <END>  is consistently good no matter when I go. Great  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  in Chandler (Only one I have been to so far)Flavorful and about average  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  wise. Would absolutely go back again.I have to try out  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  other  <START:Ambience> locations <END> , Gilbert would be my next stop.

Went here on Sunday afternoon, went here a couple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  when i first moved to Vegas, but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  back in years. I liked the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  before and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  still met my expectations.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is laid back, seat yourself, dark pub. One thing I learned  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have no kids seats. And really no Kids  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . (though you can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  them a grill cheese or quesadilla for $4.99) Losing some  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I had the Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was delicious. Big, Juicy, with some Maui onion, aged cheddar and heirloom tomato. Though for $13.99  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  could throw in some  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . My wife had a Reuben  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> which <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  liked.  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list is good, not great. I did have a Rouge hazelnut brown 22oz. for $5.75 off draft, so not bad  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . All in all the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , meet expectations for a standard pub.  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  going to if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is what your  <START:Ambience> looking <END>  for.

Very modern.  Very chic. Very cool.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  goes without saying  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  at Mix is incredible.  Celebrated  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  Alain Ducasse has created an inspired  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  The only problem is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was not as memorable as I would have hoped from a  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  who has multiple 3 Michelin  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in France.The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has undergone changes since Mix first opened.  Although  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  now is "Americanized"  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  lacks the classic  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  one could only have enjoyed if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  went to France or Monte Carlo.  At least  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  still have the gnocchi.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is fantastic as is the halibut with saffron braised potatoes in a bouillabaisse sauce.    <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent.The wine list is extensive but  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  run high even by Vegas standards.A special note;  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  taking the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to have a drink at the Mix ultra lounge before  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  Incredible  <START:A_OutsideView> views <END>  of the Strip.  Good cocktails.Finally, even if you book months in advance, you probably will not be given one of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  window  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .  A $50 "gratuity" to the host will assure  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you do.  Its Vegas baby!

Pretty good  <START:Food> food <END>  and plenty of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! Barbecue snobs need not eat here. Yea, some will be put off by the smokiness of the 'cue but after being barbecue-deprived from nearly a year in the middle of nowhere  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was some serious chow action!  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  also sell  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  BBQ sauce ( <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  and spicy), and some BBQ tools as well as  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  Magic Dust dry rub,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I promptly shipped some to Kwajalein!Barbecue snobs need not eat here. I'm not one of 'em. If you've got a craving for 'cue, look no further!

Go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for full  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , not for  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  or  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . Many delicious  <START:Food> meal <END>  options. I'm not a big Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  fan, but I can tell full  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  when I have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was great! The  <START:Food> food <END>  was great, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was awesome (I'm lactose intolerant and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  went out of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  way to accommodate me), the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were great and the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  isn't too bad (average for a steakhouse). Overall I would totally recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and plan to visit again.

Best Aged- <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Vegas!The only down note was the rock music playing.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't fit with  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  type of fine-dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .My wife had the filet mignon.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  out two (one for each of us) by mistake.  When I told the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  the correction he told me to enjoy the filet and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  he would bring me my aged  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  shortly. So...I had the turf-and-turf and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was sensational!

When we drove up to Pearl for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  appeared very upscale,  <START:A_Decor> lighting <END> , high ceilings, modern furniture. However, not so much. The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  tries to be upscale, but the plastic  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  and junk cluttering the walkway to the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  brings  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  down.  <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent, but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no gluten free  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is not aware of gluten free  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END> , except for gluten free soy sauce.  <START:Food> food <END>  was fine. Lots of fun  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . If  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are trying to appeal to the average working non-celiac patron,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 've succeeded.

Again top notch British fare ven a little store where you can buy the British goods you miss so much from home  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a little gem at 16th Street and Bell. You should not miss  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  Saturdays and Sundays are awesome you gotta do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  for a traditional English Brekkie

 <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> , and the back  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  is so much fun for a classy girls night out!  The  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  of the house is dark and romantic for date nights.

I always thought  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was Shwartz's lame brother, but after not wanting to be part of the museum like tourist line, as a local I wanted a good deli style  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  without the wait. Le Main is well known for late night pub grub but having gone  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  recently with some out of towners  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  holds up as a great diner  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the smoke  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  platter and smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  poutine with Cherry Cotts! For about $44  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  hit the  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  and didn't have to get cattle proded in and out because of too many people. Long story short, if your heart is set on visiting the Graceland of Smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  then go and line up at Shwartz's if you want to actually eat because your hungry you can cross the street sit down and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  great  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  here too.

DELICIOUS  <START:Food> lunch <END> , snack and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  in the Old Port. Between the four of us, we tried two different paninis, some wine, the raspberry-lime-lemonade (OMG), a latté and an espresso. I skipped  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and went straight for the almond croissant, and have no regrets.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was served warm and was oh so tender and not too sweet. Everything was top- <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and very tasty. Five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for the  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was fast & friendly too ( <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  now have table  <START:Service> service <END> ).At 4 p.m. on a Saturday, we had a 20- <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  wait so went around the corner to the Phi Centre to check out the art installations. We found the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  quite crowded and noisy --  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's what you get at a (deservedly) popular  <START:A_Environment> spot <END> , I guess.  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  were normal for the Vieux Port, about $12 for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and $4-5 for a pastry.Another coup de coeur from the book "Devorer Montréal" by Claire Bouchard & Chantelle Grady.

Came in here for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today and although I was seated promptly, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was very very slow and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was hard to get a  <START:S_Staff> server <END> 's attention. I had decided what I wanted to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and still no one was coming around to take my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  until  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  got down to me staring at the waitstaff. I wound up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  spaghetti  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was being advertised.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good although I'm not crazy about smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  but I figured I'd try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  anyways. The other thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sadly has landed  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review down to two  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  is the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . For what I had, the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  was a little steep for my liking and refills on my soda weren't free  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I suppose I should have thought to ask. Anyways, I may or may not come back depending on who I'm with..but I probably won't if I'm on my own like I was today.

Our favorite stop off the island.  Best on Friday or Saturday night when things are hopping and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and kitchen keep things fresh and moving. Great spirit, perfect  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  pan, rest of  <START:Food> food <END>  is good and pretty straight forward. You will never find the free wifi  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  promise, but the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is big and varied and you can get a bit of a line on some nights. Hopping  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , hockey is always on.

So now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I live on the East Side, I've come to really appreciate and enjoy Alchemy. Yes,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's small, and yes,  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's almost always a wait for a table. Yes,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  only take cash, but hey,  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's an ATM  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  only charges a $1 fee.Despite those very minor inconveniences, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a true gem. Nothing beats sitting at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , enjoying one of the awesome taps  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  always have available (or a classic cocktail, or a very reasonable bottle of vino), with a plate of grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> which <END>  comes with a spread/dip  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  changes regularly), and then splitting an entree with a friend.I've yet to have  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  isn't delicious; from  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  frys to the bella  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  -  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's all superb.  <START:Service> service <END>  has been consistently good, and the vibe/feel of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is so welcoming.Go. You won't regret  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

Hotpot? Check! All-you-can-eat? Check! I discovered  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  several years ago and have been visiting ever since. Gone is the buffet-style, you'll now find the whole  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  has been renovated and re-designed. You now  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  each item from a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you fill out, and the overall  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  has gone up from what I remember. Everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh (beef, lamb,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , squid, mussels, vegetables, tofu,  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , sausage, noodles) and was presented quite nicely. What you lose by not being able to pick 1 piece of an item, you gained in  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . You can still self-serve soft  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and mix up your own dipping sauce.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are also  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  available with no charge ( <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END> , sesame balls, canned  <START:Food> fruit <END> ) and some  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  to buy for an additional charge.Overall I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  system is an improvement and am already thinking about going back in a couple of weeks.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  poses as a wine  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> / <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but frankly  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be better off if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  just lost the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  bit.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is fabulous -  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  new will always take your fancy, but more so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is no of the ordinary, I cant think of anywhere else  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  does such a different  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . If i was a  <START:Food> food <END>  critic I would call  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  innovitave, but I'm not, so make up your own mind. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is alwaysgood value for money, extremely tasty and quick to arrive.Now for the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  side of things. Firstly, its expensive - even the special deals on things like cocktails are on the dearer side. Its always empty too, meanin  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  just seem to hang about. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area has seats and  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>   <START:Restaurant> which <END>  are far too low and uncomfortable to enjoy your  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  here, and the booths are pretty cramped, but so isolated you cant split your party across two for fear of never seeing your friends again.As I said, great  <START:Food> food <END> , poor  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .

Okay, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is no frills, simple, would almost qualify for Triple D... Except,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  good.  We've been to a few Triple D joints and most have been disappointing, making me wonder how much  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  to grab Guy's attention and the publicity.   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of Louisiana brings  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> !!!!   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , smell, appearance, and  <START:Food> portion <END> ... All good.  What would make them great?  One thing... Liquor license... so I could have a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  with my fab  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> !Glad I grabbed the 'go' box because I had serious craving the next day.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  reheated perfectly and I learned  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  was really the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  and not over saturation of grease.Momma loved her Gumbo and appreciated  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were NOT huge slimy chunks of okra in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The hibernate  <START:S_Staff> man <END>  and I had oysters,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END> ... All worthy of  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  again and again and again.  I enjoyed the tater  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  but we both thought the dirty  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  could have used more  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in much, much larger pieces.  As  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was so minimal and small  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  could not be  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  even though I could see  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ...  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , and the lack of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , were the only down sides to our kickin' Lous-E-anna  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> !

Fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I agree with the other reviews. Don't go here for the  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's nothing bad,  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's just better mexican  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , the  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> , and the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to be though.

What a great find!    <START:Restaurant> this <END>  Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is located next to the Ultrastar Movie Theatre at Wadell and Litchfield Road in Surprise.   From the outside, you can't tell  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a really nice, roomy,  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on the inside.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a sit down Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with all you can eat  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> .  (Before we went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I thought  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was just a small fast- <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but I was wrong -  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a big, full- <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .)   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have very reasonable  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> , great  <START:Food> food <END>  and a great  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> .  How can you go wrong?

JT's is a small, family-operated diner right on Brownsville Road across from the Whitehall Plaza.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are open for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very friendly and  <START:Food> food <END>  is good.  The JT Omelet is my favorite.  The fare on the TV is rather mind-numbing and the syrup is just corn syrup, but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are generally quite busy, so many customer don't count these major issues.

I love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  here!! Try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and you'll be satisfied.

Left zarkana and decided to grab a bite.  Talked my spouse into trying  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and boy am I glad I did.  The ceiling is like watching a school of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  passing over.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was remarkable in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  attentiveness and  <START:S_Stf_Experience> knowledge <END> -  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  seems to be less important to many of the venues I have sampled during  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  week in town.  I enjoyed the deconstructs thoroughly.  My biggest issue was trying to narrow the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  down to a single choice.  I'm not gonna lie,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had me at the corn  <START:F_FoodItem> muffins <END> .  A great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> !

Came here on my last visit to Las Vegas after finding a coupon online.  Immediately after walking in I sensed chaos.  The  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  could not keep track of people walking in as  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  kept walking away from her stand.  People starting getting angry and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  just didn't want to deal with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  Finally got seated, but the waitstaff, just like the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  seemed to show much indifference to our presence.  Finally after being served our  <START:Food> meals <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  really was just eh.  I think the Olive Garden (I am not really a fan either)  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better.  My broccoli/cavatelli was swimming in  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> /oil...I didn't even want the left overs.  Won't be returning.

I live in summerlin so  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a little out of the way but way  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the trip. The pablano stuffed with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  is so damn good! I wanted to take a whole other one home to eat later.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> 's here are authentic and have just the right kick.  Gustavo is an absolute gentleman and makes you feel like you are eating at his home.

 <START:Food> food <END>  lion strip mall Chinese  <START:Food> food <END> , also offers deliver.  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  had always been good and  <START:Food> food <END>  is exactly as you'd expect.

I recently went to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  establishment for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .I have been here before but decided to give them another go since  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  remodel  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  expansion.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was slow at best.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  weren't very busy, may have been understaffed. I imagine  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  well as the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  didn't seem interested.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  signature "Vinny's  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> " medium-well, with a side of french  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  came overcooked and dry.The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , also overcooked.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  advertise fresh-cut  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , but my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  had a very dark appearance and will small in length.I'm sure  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  does great bottle/six-pack business due to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  large selection. <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  may want to reconsider  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  or better yet, give up  <START:Food> food <END>  all together.

Great  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , lots of  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  to choose from! However, if its Friday- get the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  fry! Do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and thank me later.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  also offer tater tots on the side,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  is kind of my favorite thing ever.

Watson Road is one of the last stops on the West side of Buckeye while heading towards California so I knew I should stop for a bite to eat (or wait over an hour til the next town). I saw the signs for a Cracker Barrel and my memories of a good 'ol hot country  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  sounded real good. When I got inside and realized how packed the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was, I decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  to go. So, based purely on what I could eat while driving, I had to say no to the biscuits and gravy I so love or  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  fluffy  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> . I narrowed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  down to handheld  <START:Food> food <END> ;  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> . Almost went with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> catfish <END>  or grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , but ended up with the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  (hoping for a lil bit of comfort with each bite). The sourdough  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> which <END>  had some sort of glaze) was really good, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't toasted so the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>  started to make the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  soggy. And  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END>  wasn't thick and generous like I've had at BJ's or other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> . And because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't made too firm,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  kept falling out of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and onto my shirt (lucky, no car accidents). The store had neat stuff (bought a cow mug  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  had utters) to browse while waiting for my  <START:Food> meal <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  (thanks Jenifer) were great. But if you want to eat and enjoy  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , don't get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to go. My biggest mistake.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great!Stick with the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  We tried the sausage plate and hot dog and neither were  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  exciting.I love the duck and pork belly baos.  I would have liked to try the short rib one but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  told me  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  took  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  The Banh mi  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was also very good.I would love to give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  5 starts bu the  <START:Ambience> location <END>  is not great for people staying on the Strip--about $20 cab each way from Mandalay,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  basically doubles the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  of anything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  5starts is you have your own ride but not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the cab ride.  Please open a  <START:Ambience> location <END>  on the Strip!  Please!!

When staying at Caesar's Palace,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is one of the more affordable and familiar  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to munch at.  Whether  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a large  <START:Food> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  or refined  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  tacos, the  <START:Food> meal <END>  is decent in terms of  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  and  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  given  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's in Vegas.  I'd  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the sweet potato  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  on the side. <START:Service> service <END>  is fast and friendly.  The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is a bit bare with cramped seating in small  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  next to gambling  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  with smoke.   <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is ample in the hotel's garage.

I guess you'll all have to count me as part of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  "vocal minority" who are critical of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has joined a long list of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in the South West of Las Vegas  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I won't be visiting a second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Perhaps  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  depends on who you get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  influences your perception of customer  <START:Service> service <END> , but my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as a walk-in customer was one of being rushed into my decision so the proprietor could get on with more important things.The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was edible, but with a very bland  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  and unevenly cooked.  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  knots are tasty but are beyond greasy.An uncomfortable  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:O_Pay_Method> paid <END>  off with blah-tasting  <START:Food> food <END> .

DO NOT GO IN  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!! I made a yelp account just to write  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  horrid  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .I never knew I could get the WORST POSSIBLE  <START:Service> service <END>  EVER, especially in Las Vegas. If you're thinking bout eating in here, TURN AROUND and go to Pinks just outside or  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  me next to fat tuesday.I ate here with my friends Friday 2/10/12 for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and we were sure in for a  <START:Service> treat <END> . We got seated right away and asked for orange juices all around. 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later someone comes to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> : 2 Classic Breakfasts, Sausage Biscuits, Bucket of Wings,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  & Eggs, and  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  Skins (Potato Skins).  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  comes back with waters all around, still no orange juice. 15 min later.. Bucket of wings come out; pretty good, not the best but still somewhat satisfying. (Still no orange juice)20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  have gone by no orange juice and still no  <START:Food> food <END>  at our table. We're getting restless and impatient. Since no one bothered to ask us for refills we asked one of the  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  passing by to see if our  <START:Food> food <END>  was ready. Another 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later, our  <START:Food> food <END>  has arrived. Classic  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  - Eggs were cold. Not hot. Not warm. Cold. Tater tots cold. Bacon was the only thing even close to warm.Sausage biscuits - You can tell by the look of congealed formation of skin on the gravy on the biscuits  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was only possible to achieve  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  look from sitting around too long. Not to mention  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the biscuits were getting harder by the second. Hopefully  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  think twice before putting  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  biscuits in the microwave.  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  skins - Looks nice. No sour cream?? Potato skins were not even baked long enough, no crisp whatsoever.  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  & Eggs - Asked for medium rare, came out well done.After all our  <START:Food> food <END>  was delivered, we had to ask for our orange juices. We couldn't even finish our  <START:Food> food <END>  because of the low  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> . I don't understand how you can eat at a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and not even get asked "how's everything tasting?" "would you like refills?" "everything come out ok?" not once. After we asked for the check the busboy had was cleaning the table, literally everything while we were still sitting down. Picking up silverware, napkins,  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> , and even wiping  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  down while we were trying to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> . Couldn't  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  have waited till after we left? I would never come back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  God-forsaken  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Worst  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> . Worst possible customer  <START:Service> service <END> . Worst lack of integrity for a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Save yourself the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and eat at pinks 2 min away or  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  me down the walkway, you won't regret  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

Kennedy's is a fun  <START:A_Environment> spot <END> !  I have only really gone to drink,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have some great specials and a fun  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is typical  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END> ..nothing to write home about.  Sports fans,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have flat screens everywhere, all over the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  as well.  A fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go out with friends on a sat night as well as a fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to day drink on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> !  I'm a fan

My pregnant sister was craving  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  for the longest & 1 of our friends told us about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  so we decided to check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out after  <START:Food> dinner <END> . As I came in, I smelled  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  wonderful & sweet. Even though I was kind of full from eating at Montesano's Italian Eateria nearby, my stomach got excited again & my mouth started watering w/ the aroma. I got such a bad sweet tooth.The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was so clean & had  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  cute modern look. Very friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Very reasonably  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were so many options on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Everything sounded good. We ended w/ the Cookie Monster, Banana Foster & the Elvis  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  w/ vanilla  <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END> . AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cookie monster was my favorite.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was like eating  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  Half Baked  <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END>  by Ben & Jerry's but 100x's better. OMFG! I seriously want to come back again today. I'm in love.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  having a  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  in shape of a cone w/  <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END> . I can't believe I've been missing out all  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . So thankful for my sister's pregnancy cravings. Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm going to try either the Rebel or Tickle me Berry w/ the green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ice cream <END> . The Maui Fever sounds good too. I'm so excited for my next visit!

The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I came here was with a bachelor party. We were sitting in the lounge area by the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  doing some drinking, and unbeknownst to us, the  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  here are scantily clad, sporting massive jugs. I'll get to the  <START:Food> food <END>  in a second.So we're sitting down and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  is right behind my friend Zach.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  says, "Would you guys like any  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ?" Zach swiveled around to answer and accidentally got a face full of 36 F's. Like, an unintentional motorboat. Great life moment. Also, the little  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  with the tongue ring is highly attractive in  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  librarian kind of way, and you know  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  also owns thigh high boots... na'mean? I'd shake those  <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END> . I'd let her hold my stein. With my eyes open and the lights on. Mmmmhmmm darlin'.The  <START:F_FoodItem> shakes <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> shakes <END>  are insanity in a glass. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a Compost shake and immediately wanted to vomit. I mean  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  in the best way possible. Think of like - an excitement induced vomit. Like when you get married or  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END> . Actually,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's probably not the best analogy. What I'm trying to say is the  <START:F_FoodItem> shakes <END>  are incredibly rich and tasty, and I would recommend the Compost shake to anyone who was punishing themselves with tastiness.The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  I ate was so delicious,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are no words to describe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The best way to describe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would be to make a series of guttural noises and then pass out face down into a pile of puppies. I hadn't had anything like the kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  in a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just what I wanted. My pants also wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , because I came home with the bad kind of stained pants. Messy  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .Two other things  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  stood out for me were the awesome art adorning the walls, and my  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> 's enormous handlebar mustache. Good on you, mate!

I doubt  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still a secret as to how to find  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  joint, but just in case someone needs a tip:  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a hallway on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan between Blue Ribbon and Jaleo. If you're coming up the escalators,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 'll be almost directly in front of you.I've had  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  a handful of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and have always enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Today was no exception. I went with  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  simple:  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  white pie ( <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  sauce and healthy chunks of ricotta cheese) with sundried tomatoes. Deeee-licious!  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  is fantastic (LOVE thin  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END> ). Now,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not my absolute favorite white sauce, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still damn good. And if you're not a white sauce fan,  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  red sauce is fabulous too. Also, if you're not on the go or in a hurry, get the whole pie and take  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  home!  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the savings (a slice of white pie is $5 compared to a whole white pie for $30). Oh, but pass on the fountain drink though;  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a red Solo cup for four bucks. Yikes.

I am picky, let  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  be known. Park Brugges satisfies my endless craving for mussels much in the same way its sister  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  does. Situated in the charming business district of Highland Park, Park Brugges is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to spend a romantic evening, or get your grub on after work. Roll up those sleeves because moule's can get a bit messy at  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  if you dive into them with a zeal such as mine.I imagine  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have other fantastic  <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I am sure of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Alas, I doubt I will ever discover  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  for myself as I am too busy getting lost in a sea of curried moules and crispy frites (mayo!), while the current of Unibroue carries me onward.

Came back to La Petite France twice after my initial visit, and both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  were for  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> . I'm giving  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  one more  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  just for the delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> savory <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> !  Although  <START:Service> service <END>  is consistently slow (compare to many other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ), I kinda respect  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are French, and why rush when you have the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to enjoy a nice  <START:Food> meal <END>  :) So if you are busy with a limited  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for a  <START:Food> meal <END> , just don't even bother to come!

Meh.

Zoe's is special for not fearing the Americanized  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  bud. I don't mean the  <START:Food> food <END>  is super exotic... I mean  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't serve deceitful  <START:Food> food <END>  just because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's popular.Many a "healthy"  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is so scared of people complaining about  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  hide absurd  <START:F_FI_Size> quantities <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> , fat, and salt in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dishes <END> , just to avoid losing clients  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  probably shouldn't be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  anyway. The rest of us end up with an entree  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  appears greener and more nutritious, but is actually just brimming with the same problem  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  as the  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  secretly wanted.Not at Zoe's. Sure, not every dish is "healthy", but the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is pleasantly accommodating to any diet.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  replaced every one of the original sides  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came with my kebabs in exchange for a heap of veggies without hesitation. You can pretty much build your own dish, and for people avoiding gluten, dairy, obesity,  <START:Restaurant> this <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , and the other...  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's pretty cool. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is cooked simply, nothing is drowned in sauce, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't skimp on the greenery. Plus, calories and nutrition facts are all available if you're feeling neurotic. Kudos to Zoe's, because even if my veggies would have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  better soaked in cheese, my stomach thanks you.

 <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for another update and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is still holding 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ! <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will remain one of my favorites and moving to the other side of town sucks for a go to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for me like  <START:Restaurant> this <END> .  I will drive over here for my hand made noodles, I guess because I have become spoiled!  The  Lan Zhou Beef Noodle  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  is my goto FAV and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we splurged on calories and had the Spicy wonton  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  with chili sauce.  OOMMGG yes a double OMG good love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  stuff.  Would  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  but my waist will not allow  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .  *Grumble* The hibernate  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  is back home visiting so the  <START:Service> service <END>  is not quite to par but I won't fault them for  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is temporary  <START:Service> service <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  awesome as always and gesh I feel like I am saying good by :( a 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  drive will happen here and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  but not as much as I would like.Love the  <START:Food> food <END>  and highly recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .

Don't judge a book by its cover, considering  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is in Papago Plaza. Mikas Greek is very nice inside, with a modern twist. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is always fresh and the customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is on point.

 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  opened in the same  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>  as Village  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  had closed several months ago.  I was hoping  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  would have gotten rid of the bad  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  cleaned and redid the  <START:A_Decor> interior <END> .I think  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  new tenant has what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  takes to stick around.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's basically a mom and pop version of CiCi's.  I was greeted by a friendly face at the counter where I had an option to purchase the buffet or a la carte.  I had come for the buffet, so the buffet  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was.  The  <START:Food> lunch <END>  buffet was $5.49.  I grabbed my beverage cup and found a table.  The buffet featured  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , and two types of  <START:F_FoodItem>  pasta <END> ..I can only speak to the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  here because I ignored the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem>   pasta  <END> .  I can tell you   that   the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  appeared to be your average  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  featuring romaine, and the  <START:F_FoodItem>   pasta  <END>  served was penne and spaghetti.  The   pizza   was decent.  Nothing outstanding, but I wasn't paying for outstanding.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were several different varieties of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  available and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  even took requests.  I asked if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had a buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  said Sure!  Ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was out.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  calls out the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> -type as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 're put on the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is extremely helpful in getting the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  you want. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's styrofoam plates and cups, so nothing fancy.  But the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is decent and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is outstanding.  I'll be back!

An authentic  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for meditation  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> every thing <END>  is fresh. I have tried Greek  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and lambs shawarma with yellow  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . All  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  are really delicious. <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to try on weekdays  <START:Food> lunch <END>  too,the last don't  forget to try "Baklva "  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is Yummy too.

Yes Indeed I am a Fan of Le Thai. I find myself finding ways to be near Le Thai on East Fremont Downtown, just in case I get hungry.. I love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  little Thai  <START:A_Environment> spot <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a more fused-up style of Thai cooking, hence the 'Le' :] but I love everything about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I have never dined anywhere other than on the back  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  under the mist sprayers, and even in 100+ degree heat,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is really comfortable back  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . With all the  <START:F_FoodItem> items <END>  you would expect from a Thai  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  - like Pad Thai and Panag Curry, Le Thai also incorporates some other delicious  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> .  My personal favorite is the Spicy Eggplant with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's. Really. Delicious. The only thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I find is difficult for me to grasp is  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 're spicy seasonings. I can handle, and do enjoy some heat in my Asian-Style favorites, but the spice is often not consistent at Le Thai. I usually get a '4' out '5' when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  ask for a preference in spice level.. Sometimes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's perfect, and sometimes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not spicy at all, and then other  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I can't even eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's so hot.  I have been told  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use 'Ghost  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END> ' (look  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up..its a really HOT  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END> ,) on the hotter end of the scale.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  may be why  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's sometimes hard to handle. The remedy for me, has been to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a level 3 and spice  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  up with the  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and chili sauce  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  bring to the table. Then  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's perfect for me every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . If you haven't tried  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , and love Thai  <START:Food> food <END> .. I think you will be very happy with Le Thai. Everything is fresh and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is great and the  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are right. See you  <START:Restaurant> there <END> !

Stopped in for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to go.  No greeting while I stood at the counter waiting to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and two  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  looked at me.   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were ok but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were dripping in grease.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  was very tender but lacking in  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  I loaded  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with  <START:S_Staff> chefs <END>  special sauce and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was much better.  The carolina sauce  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like French's mustard with paprika and a little bit of onions.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  made for good sauce to dip my  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .  All things considered I would give them a B-

Poor Customer  <START:Service> service <END> !! First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  I asked if the sauce was smooth and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was. The small  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was great, very tasty. Second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on a large  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , sauce was chunky, and my reviews show, I hate chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  sauce! (I know I'm fussy, but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's the way  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is) Last Monday 2/20 we went again for a large  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . I asked the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  could put smooth sauce on our  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , like straining  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  or removing the chunks.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  checked with the kitchen and told me " <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's the way the sauce is" meaning take  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  or leave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . To me,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wouldn't have been a big thing to take a  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  to remove the tomato chunks before baking my  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  to keep a customer coming back. So, since  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't take care of my needs, I will never go back  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and I'm using Yelp to vent my displeasure with  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . To the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> : Take care of the customers, or  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  won't come back.NOTE 3/4/2012-Lori from DeMarco's contacted me offering to "be our guest so we can make you happy". A nice gesture, but I don't care now. I don't want a free  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We'll spend our yearly $1500-$2000 on  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  someplace else.

My husband and I are foodies in the sense  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we LOVE  <START:Food> food <END>  and particularly enjoy 1. farm-to-fork establishments even more so if 2.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are inventive.I'll give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  inventive. I had a bacon-infused cocktail  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was shaken with a whole egg. Now, I LOVE inventive cocktails. I consider myself somewhat of a cocktail connoiseur (hands down best cocktails ever = Santaella in Puerto Rico).  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  eggy, bacon concoction was just weird, though.On to the hibernate course. My husband had the Heritage Farm  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Breast & California Chorizo Sausage. The  <START:F_FoodItem> mole crumb <END>  was yummy. But the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was so (so, so!) very dry!! So much so, he requested more sauce to help make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  palitable (if  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  had been a larger  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , we'd have sent the dish back....we didn't want to hurt  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  bottom line). I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the King Salmon. I love King Salmon -- I've prepared  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> . The plate was $34 -- not outrageous for King Salmon. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would have been a steal if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good.... but sadly  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was mushy. The table next to us sat three couples -- each of the wives  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dish and I noticed not one ate even half. Again, if  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  hadn't been a mom and pop operation, the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  would have gone back....The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is cute and rustic. Although the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and chairs feel like  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 'd be better suited for a diner. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was friendly and attentive. We came to Pittsburgh for a foodie weekend... and had anticipated  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would be the pinnacle. We left, unfortunately, feeling like our  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  (and money) would have been better spent elsewhere...

Nandos was by far my favorite chain  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Europe. The butterfly  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was amazing, as I had one in the London, Dublin, and Edinburgh  <START:Ambience> location <END> . A must have if visiting!

In the never-ending  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  wars here in Las Vegas, Bachi  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  continues to be one of the best for me! <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have an Asian Fusion thing going on  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is amazing! Don't worry...you traditionalists can still get a basic cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ...and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  will be amazing too!A few highlights - the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are really interesting. I like the the S&P  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , and my partner likes the truffle  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  with drizzle. Check them out. Also the Pork Belly  <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END>  are awesome too!  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  make a great starter!

Pretty much the best doughnut I've eaten, ever.I am no connoisseur, despite the overly descriptive detail  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  will follow, but have had my fair share of donuts over the years and was admittedly impressed to find  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is in fact possible to make a version  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  noticeably different than any other.We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  twist, a  <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk <END> , a seemingly simple glaze, and Thai  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . I bit into the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  twist first as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  tends to be a fave and noticed immediately  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a slight crisp to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I had never experienced. The  <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk <END>  was pretty much just a delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> warm biscuit <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  had been fried twice over in  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> . So bad, yet so very good. The glaze,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  is usually my least favorite kind, ended up the real show stopper.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was like a flaky layered croissant consistency, but with  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  same oh-so- slight outer crisp  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  accompanied the rest. Just pure evil really. The Thai  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  wasn't my favorite (a little too syrup-y), but the outdoor seating was a bonus, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good, and at just under $5 the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END>  was right.  I'm a fan and will be trying my hardest not to come back soon.

We had a really good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at Stone. I'd say  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are literally only two downsides...the first is  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> , and the second is a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  layout issue, though not a real problem for our visit during a slower  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . The former is what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is...you're not likely to get a  <START:A_Environment> spot <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's close to the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  can be said for most downtown  <START:Restaurant> places <END> . The latter issue is simply where the robust wall  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is located in relation to where we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . Still not a huge issue...unless  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's packed. Then I could see  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  being tough to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from.I liked how the idea was setup, though. You pick your  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END> , your sauce, your topping, etc.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a fully customizable  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's reasonably- <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END> .I got the caprese  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was good, and I like the lack of pretentiousness with everything served on  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  trays, a la Fiori's style. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was perfectly cooked. A lot of these neapolitan  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> places <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  are popping up struggle to cook the center of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not soggy without overcooking the outside of the  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END> . Our  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  were perfectly done, though! We kept  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  simple on our visit, but overall the nice  <START:Service> service <END> , fair  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> , and delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  make Stone a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:W_Price> worth <END>  checking out if you're downtown and have a craving for  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  won't leave you feeling miserably full of grease. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  (I'm assuming based on his interaction with guests while making  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> ) was really nice and outgoing, and you could tell he was really interested in what people thought.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  mentality will help Stone stick around. I just worry about  <START:Ambience> location <END> .

Great Thai  <START:Food> food <END> .  My wife and I will be back for sure.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  loved the curry and egg rolls.

Whipped over here and enjoyed a  <START:Food> lunch <END>  outing today with Mark R. & Robyn N.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a simply  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END>  mid-sized  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  with a friendly host and reasonable  <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END> .  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  though, in my opinion, is a disaster case; very hard to follow and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from.   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's my big complaint about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .Once I managed to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a couple of things, I went with a street style Asada Taco ($1.30), and a plate of three Quesadillas, one with spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , one with beef, cheese and mushrooms, and one with marinated pork. ($6).  All three were covered with shredded lettuce and bits of cheese, and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a nice sauce floating around on the plate underneath.The serving of  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  for the three of us was dinky (even though we were  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  a few more later), &  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were paper thin.  The rest of the  <START:Food> food <END>  was very good, so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a high 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  overall for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .     :-)(Cash only.)

"Another  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> " was what I was thinking before going to BurGR.  Nowadays, everywhere you go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a "gourmet"  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .  But,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is different.  Just from walking in,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a warmth here.  I couldn't help but watch the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , and how friendly  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is for sure a rareity recently in Vegas, as  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  only seems out for a tip.  I have to mention my  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  (Karlenda) by name, because I was FLOORED by her.  If I was opening a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  tomorrow, I would be trying to steal her away.  Not only was  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  personable, but  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  had a perfect  <START:S_Stf_Experience> knowledge <END>  of the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , and knew every question we could throw at her.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  seemed honestly happy to be  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , and to be working.   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  shine before we even got the  <START:Food> food <END> .  As for the  <START:Food> food <END> , we started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and soba noodle  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was so good we were fighting over the last bite as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were trying to clear the plate.  The thing  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  impressed me the most was the range of  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  Of course,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is the "boring-middle-of-the-road" plain  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> which <END>  I have nothing against, but I want adventure when I have a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  out somewhere.  So many of the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  sound good, but I could not stop wondering about the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with the mango chutney, and so I had to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  We also had the spicy hot dog and goat cheese  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  at the table as well.  All I can say about the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was not a bite left on the table.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were AMAZING.  I couldn't believe I enjoyed them so much.  As for the hot dog, I am not normally a hot dog person, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was spicy, delicious, I couldn't believe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  I had under-estimated  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  assuming  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was going to be ok  <START:Food> food <END>  relying on a celebrity name ( <START:Restaurant> which <END>  happens, sadly).  For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  I had the banana shake with butterscotch pudding on top.  I let my friends at the table have ONE SMALL SIP, and the rest was mine.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  was not only great, but one amazing exprience I can't stop telling people about.  I can't stop thinking about those  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , and I am  <START:Ambience> looking <END>  forward to heading back over  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  soon!

Still too date my first Ramen  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in Vegas was at Monta Ramen so going too Monta Chaya  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  back found memories. I hardly go too Monta not out of dislike just not someone generally likes too wait. When you have Ramen Sora right down the road not as busy and just as good if not better. Few and far between see Monta. Monta Chaya  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  back all the things I first love about getting me some ramen just like back home in da islands. The shoyu ramen broth LOVE  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! I love the depth of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and the noodles are awesome. The gyoza now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  sorely MISS. By far all the Ramen  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in town been too few but truthfully not all. Monta gyoza is league by itself. I think its cooked too right on and the filling had so much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . I also had the kim chee fred  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  as side.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was ono. Just had right balance with the kim chee not spicy at all but well rounded with the vegetables and the sauce. I am just happy  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  Vegas is blessed too add another great Ramen  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in town. Now with so many  <START:Ambience> locations <END>  not part of town in  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  find some good Ramen.The biggest bonus about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Ambience> location <END>  and if ever need my Monta fix for sure  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:Ambience> location <END>  I would go before the original. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is the same at both  <START:Ambience> locations <END> . Just SO much nicer at Monta Chaya for obvious reason its brand new, LOT more spacious seating from  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  too seating at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , and like the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  inside very much modern asian theme. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly especially since went with my asian persuasian crew five of us in all.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  did great job of staying on top of our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and everything coming out in timing matter. So if in the area need your Ramen fix Monta Chaya is  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  too get some!!!

The  <START:Food> food <END>  was not good! The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  texture. The Cajun  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavoring <END>  was say to spicy. The  <START:Service> service <END>  over all was ok.  And the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was good.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is overrated.

Ok, folks  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a true hidden gem.  Inside the old Gold Spike, is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and  <START:Food> lunch <END> .    <START:O_Pay_Price> prices <END>  are good,  <START:Food> food <END>  is great,   <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is comfortable.    <START:S_Staff> staff <END>   are friendly and a kick in the pants.

I wish I could give 4.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .... Overall,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a pretty good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Here's how I rate everything: <START:Food> food <END>  (#19 Pho)-8/10. Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , good  <START:Food> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  for  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> . My only real complaint here is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the beef was a little fatty and wasn't sliced really thin. I've always liked when  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  serve the beef in pho paper thin-even if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  means I get less beef. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  lists one  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  foe $6.95,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's pretty big. You can apparently also  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  an XL serving, but I did not ask the  <START:O_Pay_Price> price <END> .drink (Thai iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> )- 5/10. Ok. I've had much better. $2.50. Probably won't get  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  again. <START:Service> service <END> - 10/10- I walked up to the door carrying my son in a car seat, the  <START:S_Staff> man <END>  working  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  opened the door and welcomed me with a smile, lead me to a table and grabbed me a high chair. He even put the car seat into the high chair and made sure  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was secure before signaling my  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> .  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was also great!  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  must have noticed me struggling with the chop sticks, because  <START:S_Staff> she <END>   <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  me out a fork, then a glass of water when my  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was half gone. I asked for neither but appreciated both. Top notch. <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> / <START:Ambience> location <END> : 7/10: I lump these two together because I tend to care more about the later, but I know some people put a lot of value in  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a pretty small  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , I think only 7  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  or so.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is nothing special, but you are  <START:S_Delivery> brought <END>  you  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , unlike my usual pho  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  is a small nicety.I will definitely be going here again.

Love  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The Winneburger (truck edition) is a delightfully sharp attempt to serve american classics (cheeseburgers, in particular) without relying on going overboard with  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  and toppings. So sharp, in fact,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  all I'm going to talk about is the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .Small  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> ? Check. Two patties, bacon, cheese?  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's all  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . And yet  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's one of the quickest  <START:Food> food <END>  truck eats; a perfect lead-up before you reach for  <START:F_FoodItem> something <END>  adventurous.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's everything you want out of a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  fest with half the work.The flip-side, of course, is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  if you want to be filled you'll want two. But I say  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  tapas - meant to be gobbled and savored as you wait out the lineup at a truck or  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  shop.

$6.50 all day  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ! Great thai  <START:Food> food <END> . The red curry was the best i have had on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  side of town. On par with Archie's!

We ate at texas roadhouse for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  last night. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was a young  <START:S_Staff> man <END>  with a great friendly  <START:S_Staff> personality <END>  wish I had gotten his name. We truly enjoyed him. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> prime rib <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was super tough I told him  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  and he took care of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  promptly also sent the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  over. We   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  instead  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  came out with two more sides  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was excellent. My party of four really  enjoyed our  <START:Food> meal <END>  and appreciated the swift fix of mistakes..

So Koi seems out of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Arrowhead Fountains. I mean the center  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's in definitely needs a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and I am glad Koi is  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , but Koi seems more strip mall-y/dive-y than anything. <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a lot of rolls to choose from (at least 50, one named for each state).We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the dumplings and two rolls.I am pretty sure one of the rolls was wrong, but we really liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so we didn't say anything.The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good, inexpensive.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was just ok. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I would come back to after a movie, but not a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I would go out of the way to eat at.

While staying at the Queen Elizabeth last week, concierge recommended  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to us.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was waking distance from our hotel and seemed to have a good vibe upon entering. A fabulous  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  seated us upstairs near the open kitchen area. We asked the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for  <START:Food> food <END>  recommendations and while none of us were eating red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  at the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and made  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  clear, he continued to say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a steakhouse and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was the only thing  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was disconcerting  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  he couldn't be positive about the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Grilled Cheese or fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . We then opted to just get a few  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> which <END>  were good. The fried  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese balls <END>  were delicious. We shared a fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> which <END>  was outstanding.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was delicious and came with  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END>  and shoestrings  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dish if you go and don't want  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> . Also, the quinoa  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was huge and delicious. A great plate to share.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was tasteless, overcooked and made from bad  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was dry and tasteless. The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was served in a can and we had to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were left on our table when we returned our  <START:Food> food <END> . Truly a bad  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .

This is a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  spot to grab a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  after work. While the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  didn't change my life, they were  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . Add a reasonable selection of  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and them having the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  on and you have a solid  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .
I was having a craving for Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> .  El Toro is  <START:Opinion> less <END>  than 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  from where I live and based on the reviews  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  seemed like a solid  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> .  I've not yet been to other Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in the area, so I can't say if this is really the best local option.However, based on my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  I would say that  <START:Food> it <END>  is indeed a solid  <START:S_Menu> choice <END> .  No frills, filling  <START:Food> food <END> , with LOTS AND LOTS of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  Oh man.  So much  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  So many  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  I got Vegetarian B (...why do all Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  follow the same formula for their vegetarian  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> ?) and  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  I really have no complaints about the  <START:Food> food <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  was cheap  <START:Opinion> plus <END>  we had a  <START:Offers> coupon <END> , making  <START:Food> it <END>  even  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was also  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and fast; as in, we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our  <START:Food> food <END> , and were eating  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:Opinion> less <END>  than 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later.I've had better Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  (oh Plaza Azteca...you're sooo far away right now...) but this wasn't  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>  at all.  The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  leaves something to be desired.   <START:Food> it <END>  was a bit weird and kind of looked like the remains of an  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  person's garage sale.  Nonetheless I enjoyed my  <START:Food> meal <END>  once the screaming children sitting behind us were gone.Oh yeah...and for some bizarre reason  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are bottles on  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  on each  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ...no hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  or  <START:Food> anything <END> ...just  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> ...at a Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ...am I missing something?
I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  because I wanted some  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and I was hungry. Settled on a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> intimidating <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  came in a  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> . The next thing that came was the  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  arrived a little different that I was expecting. Most  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  come on the  <START:S_Cutlery> tray <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  on sort of. Well at least the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of  <START:S_Cutlery> tray <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  was made on. You know the standard metal  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> pan <END> . Instead the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  came on a round rack on  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> tray <END> .Then while trying to grab a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  I thought  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't cut all the way though.  <START:Food> it <END>  look a while to figure out the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  wasn't cut traditionally.  <START:Food> it <END>  was cut every which way. The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , but  <START:Food> it <END>  doesn't compare to my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Some of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  didn't have  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END>  on  <START:Food> it <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was odd too because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on  <START:Food> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  also wasn't a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .I liked the crust of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> crunchy <END>  and not  <START:F_FoodItem> soggy <END> . I think I'd try some other  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  if I did go back.  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , but I'd try something else.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was  <START:F_Dessert> gelato <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two  <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> vanilla <END>  and then one  <START:F_FI_Size> scoop <END>  dark  <START:Food> chocolate <END> . The dark  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> vanilla <END>  was a bit sweet for me.
They lose 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for not having any hard cider in stock...supposedly they ran out. I can't  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  so I was left to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  a very  <START:F_Drinks> fruity cosmo <END> . Overall,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  isn't  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:Offers> special <END> . I hear the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  though. One thing going for them is that they have a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> . $3  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and munchies M-F from 3:30 - 6:30. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is nothing  <START:Offers> special <END> . Bathrooms were clean though and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> .
The  <START:F_Dessert> cheescake <END>  was standard  <START:F_Dessert> cheescake <END>  factory fare, so  <START:Food> it <END>  was above average buy below spectacular. The  <START:Service> service <END> , however was  <START:Service> amazing <END> . Probably better than any other  <START:F_Dessert> chesscake <END>  factory I ahve been too.  courtisy was spilling over by  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  in the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , from the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  to the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to the busboys. the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  even came over and asked if everything was OK.
Horrible!!! The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  don't have a clue. Sat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  just walked by. Waived your hand, they nod and guess what still no one comes by. Unbelievable how  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  functions.
Tony Roma's used to be one of my favorite  <START:Restaurant> spots <END>  as a teenager. Oh nostalgia...Where has the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  gone? Unfortunately, a lot has changed for this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  since then, specifically now with their raised  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  and smaller  <START:A_Places> portions <END> . Oh and can I mention that they don't offer the 4 different  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  anymore? Just  <START:W_Price> more <END>  of an  <START:O_Experience> inconvenience <END>  to have to ask the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  for  <START:Food> it <END> . I guess they're really trying to  <START:Offers> save <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END> , huh?I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the full  <START:F_FI_Size> slab <END>  of baby back  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  with a side of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> baked <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  ( <START:Food> it <END> 's the only  <START:Food> item <END>  that I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ). Their baby back  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  glazed with their  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  are freakin  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  and has always been freakin  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  are so  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and juicy. However, I feel like their  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  have been gradually decreasing over the years. And I'm confident to say that two full  <START:F_FI_Size> slabs <END>  today would make up a full  <START:F_FI_Size> slab <END>  back in the  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  along with  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END> . Sadly, due to a lot of their changes, I think they lost a lot of business. However, if I'm really craving baby back  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  which isn't very often these  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> , I will most likely end up coming back  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
The  <START:S_Staff> server <END> / <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> pleasant <END>  but had dirt under his nails.  Was very turned off when he handed me the  <START:Food> food <END> .  They keep  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  in the back so you cant see them which with  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  I like to see to know how fresh they are. The  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  weren't  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  either.
This is our version of Cheers. You know. Where everybody knows our name. This  <START:A_Plc_Bar> pub <END>  is really a versatile  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  changes from  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  dining to  <START:A_Entertainment> sports <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to kick back  <START:A_Plc_Bar> pub <END>  everyday. And its really conducive to all our different circles of friends. The  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> wenches <END>  are all SUPER  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and willing to please. Now that I think about  <START:Food> it <END> , I'm really spoiled by  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> . While we haven't yet memorized the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , we've memorized everything that we like on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Touting myself as a french  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fry <END>  connoisseur, I like to think that Steiner's  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> - <START:F_Ingredients> battered <END>  fries are among the elite. Bf loves the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , extra hot. They also have a  <START:F_Dessert> creme brulee <END> . Its not  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , but if ever I have a  <START:F_Dessert> creme brulee <END>  craving at 2 in the am ...
Can you say EXCELLENT! I would  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this better then Ponchos (south Phx) and right on par with Carolinas. Yep you read right. Granted this was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  but come on  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> ! The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is in a strip  <START:F_FI_Size> mall <END>  south of Peoria on the west side, with other types of Mexican  <START:Restaurant> shops <END>  all around  <START:Food> it <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  fits right in. I had a green chile  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was $4.95,  <START:Food> it <END>  came with  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  too. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  was plenty  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  and filled with a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  flavored and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  Green chilie,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with green  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was a white type not the cheddar type. YUMMY The  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were one of my favorite parts, they were soooo  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . Again  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with the white  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was very  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  and had a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  flavor. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  we re wonderful, anytime you get free  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . They also  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  type dip with the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . I do not like  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  guac but this was rather  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent,  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and attentive. The  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  area was  <START:F_FI_Size> larger <END>  then expected and was cleaner then CHINO but could still use some  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  updating. Not a fancy type  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I will be back but this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I am bringing my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> !
One of the best dinners I've had!  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pistachio <END> -crusted  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> , while my  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  had the  <START:F_FoodItem> puerco lento <END>  (slow- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ).  Both were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> !  Since  <START:Food> it <END>  was my birthday, we also had the  <START:Food> chocolate <END> - <START:F_Ingredients> peanut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  Oh my!  The buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END>  app was also a hit.I'd give  <START:Food> it <END>  five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> , but the noise level  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is ridiculous!  The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is a little cool and a bit dark for me, but still a nice   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to spend some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at, yet we couldn't hear each other speak.  I really do not find shouting conversations enjoyable.
The " <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  Ass"  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  I would recommend that to anyone. This was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and I was very much pleased. Would definitely come back and have dinner  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
Thanks to Yelp, I was able to find this  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  and brewery right behind where I stayed at Bally's for CES. For the week I stayed in Vegas, I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice. This is saying alot since  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  options to choose from on the Strip.  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , the prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  is a must try. I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  rare and mooing.  <START:Food> it <END>  came out  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and very  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> flavorful <END> . All their  <START:Food> entree <END>  comes with a  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . I opted for their  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with house Italian  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END> . Their Italian  <START:A_Decor> dressing <END>  is one of the best I've  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> . I wanted to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  like a shot with what I had left after finishing my  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  but decided against  <START:Food> it <END> . The second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I came, I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> surf and turf <END> , which was an 8 oz. sirloin with butterfly  <START:F_Ingredients> battered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> . Very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . Now the  <START:Service> service <END>  is not the most  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and keep in mind  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a strict rule that they do not allow separation of the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END> . We wanted to separate our  <START:O_Payment> bills <END>  but they said NO EXCEPTIONS! If you do want separate  <START:O_Payment> bills <END> , I'd suggest to go as party of one and request to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  next to your friends. This is a loop-hole that I thought might work. Maybe...maybe not. I only had their stout and  <START:Food> it <END>  held  <START:Food> it <END> 's own and was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . If you want  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  at  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END> , don't  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  too much about the  <START:Service> service <END> , this is a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  dinner without all the extra fluff from Vegas.
I wasn't super impressed with the India Palace  <START:Food> buffet <END> . They had a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>  interesting selections that I don't usually see at Indian  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  (like malai kofta- yum!), and also a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>  things that just looked downright unappetizing (the haleem looked really, really unappetizing- and my husband confirmed my suspicions when he, braver than I, gave  <START:Food> it <END>  a try-  <START:Food> it <END>  was gross). The  <START:F_FoodItem> chutneys <END>  were weird and  <START:Food> it <END>  was hard to track down a  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  when we needed a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  refill or something. The malai kofta was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , though, as well as a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  I sampled and I liked the inclusion of  <START:F_FoodItem> samosas <END>  on the  <START:Food> buffet <END> ... but the  <START:F_Dessert> gulab jamun <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like soap and chemicals and overall I just got a weird vibe. We won't be back.
A couple of friends told me about  <START:Restaurant> this spot <END> ... I read the Yelp reviews and finally came to try  <START:Food> it <END>  out. The reviews were right about the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> !  <START:Food> it <END> 's delish! Lots of fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  and I opted for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was MMMM  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ! I tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , yellow tail, sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . All of  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  except for the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallop <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  -  <START:Food> it <END>  was SUPER fishy and not  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  at all. Def don't recommend THAT. Everything else was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  though. Also tried a rainbow  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  and the Happy Ending  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are MANY  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  floating around always asking you if you want to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Food> anything <END>  else so  <START:Service> service <END>  is pretty much on point  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  as well. As I was reading the reviews a lot of them said the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  were all TOO  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  together, but apparently they have expanded the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are two  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END> , some awkwardly placed  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  as well, but for the most part  <START:Food> it <END>  was all  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !
My favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in Las Vegas. My wife and I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we have a craving for  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Their  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , and they don't drown the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in  <START:Food> it <END> . They give a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  array of  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  and don't skimp on them like the  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:Restaurant> chains <END> . We're very happy to have found  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  on Yelp!
I have heard such  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  things, but the actual event was so lack luster.  <START:Food> it <END>  look an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  to get our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , I won't even mention how long  <START:Food> it <END>  took for the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  wasn't even  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  full so I would hate to see if when they are busy. When the  <START:Food> food <END>  came out,  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  the  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  were wrong. The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  were odd and very  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  on any  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . The salas were both too  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  to be eaten with the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  which I think were three  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> .NEVER AGAIN
I decided to write a review for  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  but the only problem was that I have not eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in years. So I decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  take out last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the drunken  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with duck. Pros:  <START:Food> it <END>  was as  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  as ever. The  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> . They give you the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to put over separately, so be careful not to drench  <START:Food> it <END> . The duck was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  as well. The duck was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  and deboned for easy eating. Cons: they didn't give me a pair of  <START:S_Cutlery> chopsticks <END> .This is the benchmark for all thai  <START:Food> food <END> .
My daughter and I found  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  shortly after moving to Charlotte almost 3 years ago and  <START:Food> it <END>  has been our go-to spot ever since.  We've been coming pretty much once a week and never grow  <START:Opinion> tired <END>  of  <START:Food> it <END> .  For the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  We can pig out  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for $30 and when we  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  an equivalent  <START:Food> meal <END>  at a different  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  end up spending $60.  The Firecracker  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  is my favorite, but I also like to sample around the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and try to get something new every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I go.  I also love the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>  ball.  Their  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  has such  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  flavor and they use  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  rather than  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END> .  This is my daughter's favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Charlotte.  When I asked  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  how many  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  to give,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  because the  <START:Food> food <END>  is so  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  When a 9-year- <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  says a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a 5- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  then you know  <START:Food> it <END> 's  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , right?
Mlife black cardholder + free points = No  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , lots of people throwing shade at you.  Hah!Foodies rejoice, this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  has  <START:Food> it <END>  all.  From  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  to red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and fancy little  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  in between, how can you not love  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ?  Probably one of the nicer  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  on The Strip, if not the nicest!   <START:Service> service <END>  is pretty speedy since I'm sure they want you in and out of  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ASAP.  Come for the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs, the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> , the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END> , the prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> , and don't forget  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> !  Bottomless  <START:F_Drinks> mimosas <END>  on Saturday and $20 for a bottle of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  ain't too shabby.  Would I  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  to come and eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?  Maybe.  Bellagio is an extravagant  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and they charge you for  <START:Food> it <END>  for sure.  Will I enjoy  <START:Food> it <END>  when  <START:Food> it <END> 's free?  Of course!
So  <START:Food> it <END> 's about 6 in the morning and we are leaving Tao Nightclub. LONG  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . Starving. We walk all the way from the Venetian to Palazzo to eat at Grand Lux and find out that we have to go all the way back to Venetian since Palazzo's  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  was  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  and the Venetian  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is the one that is open late. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  was a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:A_Places> portion <END>  for an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , though was a little too  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END> . I almost would have prefered  <START:Restaurant> tapas <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:A_Places> portions <END>  for this one since  <START:Food> it <END>  could hardly fit in my mouth, and  <START:Food> it <END>  came with three hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END> !One of my friends however,  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  was SO  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ! SOOO  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ! I definitely  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  again when we ate for a second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at the Grand Lux Palazzo right before we left Vegas. At 6 in the morning,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  was PACKED!  <START:Food> it <END>  might have even been 5AM, but they had a list, and a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Crazy! I was really disappointed about the Kobe hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END>  so I had to knock off a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for that reason, and I really preferred the Palazzo  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in general.
The  <START:F_Drinks> margaritas <END>  were awful!!  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like all  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  and no  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END> . They charged $11 for essentially a non alcoholic  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END> . They had like 4 dinner  <START:Food> items <END>  on their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so don't come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  trying to eat dinner.  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>  when we asked if they could add  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  since  <START:Food> it <END>  was to  <START:F_FI_Taste> sugary <END>  to even  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . They get 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> .
Excited about the reviews that  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  had gotten, my friends and I decided to try this out as our "fancy  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> " in Vegas.  The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  was very nice, and I think the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  they used were definitely high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  But somehow, just didn't quite  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  off my tongue like I would've liked.I started off with the Arancine ( <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ), and while the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  combined with the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , I was not a  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  lost the richness of its flavor, while the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END> -ness was just not quite as  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  as say, on a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  okra.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> -based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was splendid, however.  For my  <START:Food> entree <END>  I got the short  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> raviolini <END> . Now, I must caveat that I was disappointed with this  <START:Food> entree <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> truffles <END>  I believe) in my  <START:F_FoodItem> raviolini <END> , and I do not like  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> .  However, the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  didn't SAY that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  would be  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and I believe that the flavor was strong enough that  <START:Food> it <END>  should've been warned of.  With that sad, I also tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> gnocchi <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> linguine <END> , and the rigatoni.  The rigatoni was the best out of the  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  that I had... overall the  <START:Food> entrees <END>  were pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , but the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  flavored overwhelmed my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  buds a bit and I wasn't able to enjoy the rest quite as much.While  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  was reasonably  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , I would definitely recommend Circo at the Bellagio over this.   <START:W_Price> prices <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were comparable from what I remember (went a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>  months ago), but the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  were far  <START:W_Price> more <END>  delectable.
Went to watch  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  3 of world series on sat afternoon. Had to complain to  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  just to get  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  on 1  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END> , they had espn college football news on 7 screens , got  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  on 3  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> viewing <END>  screens from  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area. Other 7 ppl watching world series left during 4th inn to go elsewhere to watch.   <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  but this is world series.
Not worth the $50. Sure is unlimited  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> , but the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  doesn't even  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was tough, and tasteless.  I actually had to throw one away because  <START:Food> it <END>  smelled terrible, and  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> . The two  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  is for the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> ,  their  <START:F_FoodItem> tiramisu <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> gelato <END>  are  very  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !
We enjoyed the  <START:S_Cutlery> pan <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roast <END>  and the Gumbo. Both were enjoyable a reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  for the offering.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:S_Del_Time> timely <END>  and attentive.
Everything I ate  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  brunch was excellent, seriously. Usually I leave a lot on my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  at these  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> , but not  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs were  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  and I became addicted with that drawn  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were peeled and CLEAN and juicy. Prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  wasn't dry or chewy, just super yummy. All the  <START:Food> food <END>  is high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is so much to choose from. We had a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>   <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarians <END>  and one vegan and all were very satisfied, so that says something. I picked this out for a group of 21(!!!) girl friends and we were SO happy; they couldn't stop praising me! Also a huge  <START:Opinion> plus <END> , they sat us all together!  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  Market @ Planet Hollywood split us up between 3 far away  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . Boo.Go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you're looking for a mid-range brunch  <START:Food> buffet <END> . The end.
 <START:Restaurant> this spot <END>  is Eithopi-ILLIN'! I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a bunch of  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and always come away smiling, belly bursting with spongy Injera that expands in your stomach. LV is a strange  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ...when I walked in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I expected the usual suspects of mangy trustafarians and tatted hipsters but was surprised to find myself dining amongst Ethiopians munching on piles of raw  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . But aside from scratching that stuffwhitepeoplelike.com itch to eat an ethnic  <START:Food> meal <END>  without any other whities in site, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is stand-up: excellent Doro Wat, Tibs, all the usual stuff. Funny though one of the "vegetarian"  <START:Food> items <END>  has ground  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  in  <START:Food> it <END> . My only complaint is they don't have Ethiopian  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , or Hej -- Ethiopian honey  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , a sweet alcoholic delight which appeals to the sorority girl in me (Deltas for life!). But they  <START:Service> treat <END>  ya nice enough to make you forget about any of that.  <START:Opinion> plus <END>  they redid the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  recently so now you have this absurd Saturday- <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> -Fever-looking panel  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  in with the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining-hall <END>   <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , creating a schizophrenic  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  that somehow makes the  <START:Food> food <END>  tastier. Maybe I'm too forgiving -- I just feel like I'm eating a REAL  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  by REAL people  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . And  <START:Food> it <END>  makes me happy and sated. What else can you ask for?
The Vig has a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> ! I've come at non happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  is pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ... however, the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are somewhat high for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . Their  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are also  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . I have had a  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>   <START:S_Staff> server <END>  a  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  or two, but I've also had very sweet  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  too.And their  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  on Sunday morning are nice!
The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is an absolute trainwreck. And  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's why: The  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  started with a 35  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , while tight shirted MMA wannabes  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  the "VIP" doorman to let them and their 30 closest friends in before us. We were in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  so long that people in front of us bailed and  <START:Food> it <END>  seemed like every person leaving was yelling to those of us in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  about how horrid the scene was inside.But we decided to stay because we had always enjoyed the one in north Scottsdale.  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>  idea. Once we finally got up to the doorman, he gave us the "whatever" distant stare and held his hand up in a "I'm holding an ID" move. No hello, or  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  to sandbar. Then they charged us $5, which would be fine if the girl collecting the  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  wasn't also cold and unattentive. But whatever, we're in let's have some fun! Wrong. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was busy but not packed, making us pretty angry that we were in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  so long. But still we couldn't get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . We flagged down 3 different  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  (who all had the exact same huge upper bodies,  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  legs and spiky hair) until the ONE person  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  doing their job approached us.  <START:Food> it <END>  was a small  <START:S_Staff> female <END>   <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  who was sweating and sprinting around the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  while  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  male counterparts sat around discussing the merits of the Jersey Shore and spray on tans. We had a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and walked around. The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is dull and unimpressive, the bouncers were all busy talking to girls, the  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  has super low celings and  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END> , the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  looks like you're at a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in Rocky Point that was  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  built but opened anyways. The  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  was pretty awful too. Lots of bumping with no "excuse me", tons of way too drunk people and very, very poor on the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  to girl ratio. After a failed attempt to get another  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , we left the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , confident that not only will we not return to this poorly designed, awfully mismanaged  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , but we will avoid the other sandbars at all  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  as well. Sorry to be a downer, I was anticipating a really fun  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  at a new  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , and  <START:Food> it <END>  ended up just being a complete waste of our  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
Don't let the hole-in-the- <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  keep you away! I LOVE  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> . The japanese lasagna  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END> . A must try!  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  too.
This is one of my  <START:F_FI_Taste> fav <END>   <START:Restaurant> spots <END>  in South Side.  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , and even though I don't usually like  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , their  <START:Food> food <END>  is really  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> !! I love watching the Pens  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  because of the  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  screen!! I went once for a Trivia  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and  <START:Food> it <END>  was packed and so much fun!
The best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  I have ever had. And I have worked at 2  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  places. I recommend the  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  crust  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  <START:Food> it <END> 's  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  enough to not need  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  than that! Also, the  <START:Service> service <END>  is personal and they have a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END> - <START:W_Price> price <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> . And we got a birthday  <START:F_FoodItem> cannoli <END> !
Very  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  panang  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> .   <START:Food> it <END>  has a complex flavor and the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is right.  Other  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  too.  Don't let the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  appearance scare you; Inside is simple and clean.   <START:Service> service <END>  is laid-back, so be prepared to stay a little bit longer than you might at some sit-down places, but they'll work with you if you let them know you can't stay long.
Any  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  where I can  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , watch the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and play trivia all while breathing in the goodness of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoke <END> -free oxygen  <START:Opinion> deserves <END>  at least 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . Forget about everything else,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  has a strict no smoking policy and that makes me a very happy person. I stopped in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  Tuesday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  around 7ish and b-dubs was packed. The happy  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  was just starting to filter out so I was able to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . The  <START:A_Furniture> stools <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  are so much better if you can snag one. The  <START:A_Furniture> stools <END>  around the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  don't have backs and they suck. If you're going to be  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for any amount of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  get a barstool that you can at least lean back in. Tuesday is 45 cent  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  lots of   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  in different  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> . My favorites are mango habanero which is my "go-to" and jammin  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END>  which I had never  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  before but loved. The  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are very small so I usually  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  than I normally would at other  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  joints. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is pretty average, about what you would expect from any popular  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> . I like the smokeless  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and lots of little  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  in different  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> , so for that, I'll go back.
I'm getting hot n juicy reminiscing about the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  in  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . When you're tempted, just remember that  <START:Food> it <END> 's not socially acceptable to feast on  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  on the full flight home.
Some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  you can find around. Hands down.I found  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  out a year ago and go back when I can. Business seems to be picking up cause I now find  <START:Food> it <END>  pretty busy during afternoons and  <START:S_OpenHours> evenings <END> . This  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  totally  <START:Opinion> deserves <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  too.I recommend the Kahuna  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  or Rumbi  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . Both are  <START:Service> amazing <END> , and come with the secret "Rumbi"  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .
Today was my first  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  dining  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and I met to celebrate two birthdays together while enjoying a  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  dinner.  I can't think of one negative thing about our complete dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  from the  <START:Food> food <END>  to the  <START:Service> service <END> .  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  Mark was hands down one of the best  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  I have ever had  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  He was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> outgoing <END>  and knowledgeable, and just took  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> care <END>  of our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  from start to finish.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly!  This will be my go to barbecue joint from this point on in the east valley area!!
5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  for our  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  Cooper and our  <START:Food> food <END> ! This is my second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to come back. We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and we got the blood  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  Cosmo which was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and strong. And then we had calamari which was so lightly  <START:F_FoodItem> breaded <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  marinara  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  especially their complimentary dinner  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  that came with some type of  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and home made  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> . Cooper was  <START:Service> amazing <END> , attentive, funny, and easy going. In fact all the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was the same. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was only $20 and our Cosmo came out to $14 and all so worth  <START:Food> it <END> ! The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is so nice and calm. This is my type of  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Count me as one  <START:W_Price> more <END>  reviewer that thinks  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is both  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END> .#13 Italian ftw
WOW! This  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END> .  I had the 7 oz  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , fries, and a creamsicle  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was juicy and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  was soft, and overall  <START:Food> it <END>  was just  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  The  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  was simply  <START:Service> amazing <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like i was eating a creamsicle, but better. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was fast and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .  The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was nice, but casual, not  <START:A_Env_Type> formal <END> . I would recommend this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to anyone wanting a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .
So I love Thai  <START:Food> food <END> !  Take this with the grain of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  considering I only  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  Pad Thai and  <START:F_FoodItem> curries <END> .  Yea, yea...I should branch out...but  <START:Food> it <END> 's so difficult when you like something so much.So how does the Viet Thai  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  House stack up?  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Pad Thai and was very pleased.   <START:Food> it <END>  was definitely different from the Pad Thai I've been accustomed to...but I usually get  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ...so maybe the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  threw  me off.  Anyhow, a friend and I both  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the same  <START:Food> dish <END>  with a hot rating of 3.  I couldn't have loved  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END> ...perfect amount of heat for me.  I do however...really enjoy heat...so a 3 may not be a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  idea for someone new to Thai  <START:Food> food <END> .  Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'll try a 4...but  <START:Food> it <END>  scares me a bit.The inside of the VTNH was exactly what I expected...well...except for the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  tanks.  The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  are casual and simple.   <START:Food> it <END> 's not a five- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ...but I haven't had better Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  in years.  I will definitely be going back...in fact...I'm wondering if  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and dinner at the same  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on the same  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  would be crossing the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> .Try:  The Pad Thai  (The Pho looked  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ...but I didn't try  <START:Food> it <END> )Avoid:  Finding  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  on your own...ask a friend or call the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for directions.
So we had a layover in Charlotte,NC on our way to Jamaica. About two  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  just enough  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to get to the next terminal, Because  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is packed. In the sea of people rushing to their next flight, I see a Familiar red and white bag in a gentleman's hand. The first thing that came to my mind was Bojangles. And while the Colonel ran "Bo" out of Kentucky, I still hold a  <START:Offers> special <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in my belly for Mr Bojangles. What you find  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is what you expect, fast, hot and fresh. Almost forget to mention  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick, not sure if the person was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , because i couldn't understand what  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said. I think  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said, may I make you over, so I just Gave  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and my  <START:Food> food <END>  somehow found  <START:Food> it <END> 's way into my hand. Love that red and yellow sign
Don't be scared off by the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  that snakes out the door, down the stairs and around the corner - this means the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END>  (and  <START:Food> it <END> 's worth the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ). If the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  is not your thing (you'll  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  a bit even if you have a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> ),  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  takeout, and you'll be in and out in just a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  flat.  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the chana samosa, baighan bharta, and the shahi paneer (these are all my favourites).  <START:Food> it <END> 's hard to go wrong, though, so peruse the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  until you find something that strikes your fancy. Go at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to take advantage of the $5 vegetarian thali. Pair  <START:Food> it <END>  with a mango lassi and you've got a  <START:Food> stellar <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . This is a hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  spot so don't expect linen tablecloths and a fine dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . What you'll get instead is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , a  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> server <END>  and some  <START:Food> stellar <END>  people-watching moments. BYOW.
Horrible customer  <START:Service> service <END> ,  I love the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  but won't go back due to their terrible customer  <START:Service> service <END> .
The  <START:Service> service <END>  was very slow despite the long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  did not  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  fresh at all.  I was lacking options but I should have just gone to the smoothies  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
My absolute favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat when on the West Coast.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is NOTHING better than a Double Double with  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Animal Style! I'm not  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  into the fries, and your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  WILL take a while to be made, but  <START:Food> it <END>  is totally worth  <START:Food> it <END> . I introduced my boyfriend to this while we were in LA and he's in love. Counting the  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  until I return to the US for that  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> !
Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with a party of 9 on a Saturday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . <START:A_Environment> environment <END> :  Sinatra has a very nice  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> .  Classy photos of Frank hung up,  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:A_Furniture> windows <END>  with a clear  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  into an atrium with  <START:A_Decor> lights <END> .  Has an  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  school classic feel. <START:Food> food <END> :  I had a Paloma to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , which was delish.  The clam  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , was decent but didn't  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  fresh.  I had the halibut for dinner, so, so dry.  My side by side dinner companions both  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  my  <START:Food> dish <END>  and confirmed,  <START:Food> it <END>  was the worst  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  they have ever had.   <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like cardboard.  I'm not sure if this is the  <START:A_Decor> theme <END>  for the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> , because the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  before we ate at Andreas and  <START:Food> it <END>  was also dry.  Horrible horrible  <START:Food> food <END> . <START:Service> service <END> :   <START:Service> service <END>  was tolerable but not the best.  I did give one additional  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for providing separate checks.  Sinatra also added on tip, when Andrea's didn't.  Inconsistent policies.  Would not go back, nor recommend.
We saw  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  on  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Stakeout, so when a Groupon came up we bought one. Overall for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  I think we would go somewhere on the strip instead.  <START:Food> it <END>  was odd to me that they had  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  crammed in one section of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  instead of opening the other side. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  we had were fresh and  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  nd I also liked that we could get a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of any  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END>  for an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> . They were okay, pretty salty though. We both had the  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  eye Oscar style.  <START:Food> it <END>  was okay, not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and I didn't realize their Oscar style wasn't with lump  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  but instead another  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ...so I was way over the  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END>  by then!Overall  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  but again for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  (without a groupon) I know  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are much better  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in this town.
Yummy- <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  on menue
Love love love  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ! I never have a  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent. This  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in the Boca Park shopping center. For customers they offer free valet  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> . If you don't feel like valet, they have a private lot for  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  or  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  garage.I love to start with the "Avocado Eggrolls" and if you have never tried them you must! They were  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  at $10.50 and can easily be shared.  My favorite thing to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for my  <START:Food> meal <END>  is the "Carlton  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ".  <START:Food> it <END>  is huge but I manage to polish off every last  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  because the awesome flavor keeps my fork going back for  <START:W_Price> more <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  at $13.95 which is fair for the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  and amount of fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  in  <START:Food> it <END> .The only problem is I never have  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for one of their many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  of fabulous  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  so I pick one to-go. This last visit  <START:Food> it <END>  was a hard  <START:S_Menu> choice <END>  but they are all so  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  I new I couldn't go wrong with the "Reese's  <START:F_Ingredients> peanut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> ".  If you don't feel like eating inside or  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> , you can phone in your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for pick up. They say to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in your car and they will bring out your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  but if I phone in a  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  I usually just go inside and pick  <START:Food> it <END>  up because they are always so doggone busy.  I noticed on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  they offer  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> catering <END> .
Went for  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was busy and loud, but decent  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  didn't disappoint.
 <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> .  The best  <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END>  I've had in a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  Love the cherry  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> .
I was pleasantly surprised by  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ! I'm a Texan so I'm always skeptical when my Vegas relatives suggest Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> . :) The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! Also the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were  <START:Service> amazing <END> !
My third visit was as equally pleasing as the first and second! This  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  I enjoyed the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> 's  <START:Offers> special <END>  of escolar encrusted with pignolias and thyme  <START:Service> served <END>  over  <START:F_FoodItem> polenta <END>  with haricot vert in a  <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END>  reduction. Everything was perfectly prepared. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was warm,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> flavorful <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , excellently  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  without being overpowered by herbs. The  <START:F_FoodItem> polenta <END>  was soft and creamy while not to rich and the green  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END>  and bright. I paired this  <START:Food> dish <END>  with one of the numerous excellent  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  that they had on  <START:Offers> special <END>  that  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . This was the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  that I ate at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is as  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and attentive as the  <START:S_Staff> waitstaff <END> . I have also sampled the buckwheat savory  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> . While the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are excellent and savory, I think that the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  could use  <START:Opinion> less <END>  mixing a bit  <START:W_Price> more <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in the  <START:S_Cutlery> pan <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>  seems overworked and under  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , but this could have just been the batch that I received. Friends on subsequent visits have had better preps for sure. The whole  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  (of which you get  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END> ) is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Service> served <END>  in a mirepoix reduction with  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  succotash. I would like to see this pared with other  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  as an option. Additionally the french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are enormous! The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is not huge but  <START:Food> it <END>  certainly is diverse and reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is something for  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END> , from the Vegan to the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  eating carnivore. The only two complaints I have about this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  are the climate and the noise. The  <START:A_Places> space <END>  is small and fun but  <START:Food> it <END>  can get very warm in the hotter months. Dress casual and cool for  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  if you go when  <START:Food> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END> . Heat is a consistent problem  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . The noise could be a problem if you are looking for a quiet intimate  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END> . This is a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  local for a group of friends or a fun second/third  <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  no doubt.(ForkOver is a Foodie transplant from Brooklyn NY searching out and writing about what's to eat in Charlotte, NC)
I have been wanting to get over to GFOM for quite a while to check  <START:Food> it <END>  out.  So finally, I was in the  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  around  6  <START:S_OpenHours> pm <END>  and decided to stop in for a  <START:F_Drinks> beverage <END>  and an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  I perused the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and decided to try the Green  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  Mussels. I absolutely loved the green  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  broth and the mussels that were perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . This was  <START:Service> served <END>  with a side of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END> , which was quickly gone as I used  <START:Food> it <END>  to sop up that  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> . Thankfully, one of the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  noticed that my  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was gone and brought me some  <START:W_Price> more <END>  so that I could enjoy  <START:W_Price> more <END>  of the yummy  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  broth after all my mussels were gone. I love the décor of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and on a quiet  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> , this would be a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  However, since I was by myself on this visit, I chose to sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . On the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  of my visit Jonathan the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  was very attentive and made sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my visit.  I didn't try any of the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , but I definitely saw some  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  looking concoctions on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  If you have not yet been over to GFOM, you should stop in sometime to give them a try. If you want to avoid the  <START:A_Env_Type> crowds <END>  that were mentioned by the other reviewers, do like I did and head over  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  early.
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in town
The following is a precautionary tale.As I was eating, I started to think about what I would write as a review. And  <START:Food> it <END>  was going to be pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , you know... for the money that is.  <START:Food> it <END> 's cheap for an all you can eat setting. Everything was going well until I went to the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> . And I found myself face to face with the two dirtiest crustiest urinals I have ever witnessed in a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Let's get something straight right off the bat, they don't clean  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . If they're not cleaning the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  (something we can see) what makes you think they're cleaning the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END> ?A fellow Yelper mentions that the Kanda on Bishop has failed multiple  <START:Food> food <END>  safety inspections.I even took a  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> , and I considered posting  <START:Food> it <END> . But this isn't the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , you'll have to take my word for  <START:Food> it <END> .
A  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  as filling and satisfying as a Thanksgiving dinner!After spending 12 years living in Southeast Asia  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is one simple  <START:Food> meal <END>  that I miss most, a simple  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> .Pho Saigon 8 will be my local  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  for authentic Asian  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . Their  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  are spot on.I had the Pho Tai Chin, rare and well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are two  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  options, small or  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  for .50 cents  <START:W_Price> more <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  double the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of the small and is helmet  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> steaming <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of satisfying  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  goodness. Before the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  arrives the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>   <START:S_Delivery> delivers <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  condiments that you can use to customize your  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> , don't be shy, add them all, the flavors and freshness they add lifts the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  to a heavenly level. Also, don't forget to  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  things up with a healthy squirt of Sriracha and a salty dose of hoisin  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is also a wickedly delightful  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that adds a solid hit of heat,  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and a touch of sour.The rare  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> sliced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  sirloin rests on  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  of the perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . Once you stir the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  into the  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> , the rare  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  becomes  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  well in the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> steaming <END>  hot broth,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , fresh - scrumptious.The depth of flavors is uber stimulating to the palate and the sheer volume of  <START:Food> food <END>  is tummy satisfying. You may need a nap if you finish the whole  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> !My wife enjoyed the Hu tieu hay Mi Dac Biet ( <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> ).  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  agreed, a fantastic,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , satisfying  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and curly.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  commented that the  <START:F_FoodItem> squid <END>  was fresh and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly.For an authentic  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of Southeast Asia, Pho Saigon 8 can't be beat.Their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is extensive and includes many other non- <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  that we will certainly be returning to try. We just couldn't handle  <START:Food> anything <END>  else on  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  of our hot tub  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> !Aloha!
The only reason that I didn't give five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  is because I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  take out  <START:W_Price> more <END>  often than I stay and sit, so I can't speak to the  <START:Service> service <END> . Their pad see ew is the best that in the Burgh and their yellow  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  as well. The last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the pad Thai,  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:A_Env_Size> bland <END> , but  <START:Food> it <END> 's been  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  before so I could've caught the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END>  on an off  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is also  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I'm a huge  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of pho and Thai and the broth in this  <START:Food> dish <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , warm, and  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  even by itself.
Typical  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  Pick your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and pick your  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  (4 are included,  <START:W_Price> more <END>  than 4 is additional $).  3  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  of fries.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>  other offerings on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area and a dining area.  They only  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  Overall, a little bit pricey for what you get.  I had a Groupon.
While in Vegas I visited Lola's A Louisiana  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END>  on Charleston near "Downtown LV"and tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  Gumbo and I must say I had a orgasm in my mouth lol !!! The Gumbo was authentic Louisiana gumbo I give that  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  a rating of 10+++ me and the hubby killed that little  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of Gumbo. When in Vegas visiting check Lola's out you won't be disappointed :-)
I've had Indian in London, in Germany, in California and this is hands down still my favorite Indian spot. The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  for a reason;  <START:Food> it <END>  is an excellent value. The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is around $7.Not only is the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , the  <START:Service> service <END>  is impeccable. I can't remember a  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  that I ever had an empty glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  or an empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  ready to be taken from the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  for  <START:W_Price> more <END>  than a  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  levels in the pans are also closely monitored by  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  so they are never out of  <START:Food> anything <END> . <START:Food> it <END>  gets slammed at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  so I usually come when they first open.When are we getting an Uptown  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> ???
 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> , unless you're in a rush. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , fresh, organic, and local.  <START:Food> it <END> 's all vegan and vegetarian fare with lots of gluten-free options. On  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END>  of this, everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .The biggest drawback is how painfully slow the  <START:Service> service <END>  is. Getting  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  and placing  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  takes no  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  at all, but be prepared to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  while for your  <START:Food> food <END>  to get to you.
Another  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  at Mitchell's Not many options for  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  in south hills
I'm so glad I found  <START:Restaurant> this spot <END> . Usually when I stay in the area I have to resort to Starbucks. Sambalatte has  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .
Was excited to go back... Not sure if ownership changed w name... But tried camelback  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and original since 1st review... Just NOT the same.  Sad was so  <START:Service> amazing <END> ... Disappointing when not consistent
 <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> .   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> buns <END> .   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> .   <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  rings.Terrible complimentary popcorn.Similar to Hoppdoddy's in Austin, Tx but not quite as  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  and I don't know that  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are local or organic.
Nice  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  was lacking . I had the 8 layer  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ..  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and the red sangria smooth and the myan  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  was their  <START:Offers> saving <END>  grace.
 <START:Food> it <END> 's a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  better then mcdonalds and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  King. Like that they do the "fat  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frys <END> " also known as  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  fries! Don't see them in to many places. They will do extras on your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  that you don't see to much either like  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> . All in all not the best not the worst. Something to throw in the belly while wasting your life savings!!!!
Best pot  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roast <END>  I've tried!
Their custom built  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are the best!!  ... You wont find  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  like this at In-n-Out or those other boring  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  places ... They offer a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of selections, their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END> , even their  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  look  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , (and they have homeade  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>   <START:A_Decor> dressing <END> , not that plactic tasting  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  in a bottle  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>   <START:A_Decor> dressing <END> ) also they're  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  too. ... Give them a try, you wont be disappointed.
A very reasonable Thai  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in the heart of Shadyside.   <START:Food> it <END>  pains me every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we walk by  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> , because  <START:Food> it <END>  looks so empty compared to Mad Mex.  But really, people, you should give Kanok a chance!  The pad thai was one of the best we've had in the Burgh so far, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> curries <END>  are done well.  Add to that sophisticated  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and gracious  <START:Service> service <END>  (and not having to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:Opinion> plus <END>  having to scream over the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at your eating companions) - what's not to like?My only  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  about the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is their  <START:W_Price> pricing <END>  -  <START:Food> it <END>  seems somewhat out of  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  with other Thai places in the area.   <START:Food> it <END> 's a little on the high side, but still worth  <START:Food> it <END> .
 <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> ! My boyfriend and I walked in and  <START:Food> it <END>  seemed  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END> . That wasn't the case once we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and found a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was a bit overwhelming for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  being  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I decided on the farmers market bene and I don't regret that decision.  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was excellent and was self  <START:S_Staff> serve <END> . The only thing I found to be weird was that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were no  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END> /silverware on the counters. When the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  bring the  <START:Food> food <END>  is when they  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  and silverware are given out. Besides that, everything went swimmingly.
The hot  <START:F_FoodItem> dogs <END>  are  <START:Service> amazing <END> !!! My favorite is the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  bulgogi  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  and the carne asada fries. Everything I've tried  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> !
Even thinking about  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  gives me a stomach ache.Where to begin, The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was fine, I liked the cheesy  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the outdated  <START:A_Ent_Tv> televisions <END> , but thats about  <START:Food> it <END>  . At first their whole hospital  <START:A_Decor> themed <END>  gimmick was cute then just got hugely annoying. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was completely unattentive and even  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is NO  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> , which you will be begging for after a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of their sodium packed but tasteless  <START:Food> food <END> . After a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of their  <START:F_FoodItem> soggy <END>  flavorless  <START:Food> food <END>  and too thick and rich  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  I was ready to leave. I am a HUGE  <START:Opinion> fan <END>  of  <START:Food> anything <END>  that tacky and greasy  <START:Food> food <END> . But all their  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  filled  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were all gratitious and adds nothing to the flavor of  the  <START:Food> food <END> . I have a stomach of steel and  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  left me with an upset stomach. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The  <START:Food> food <END>  is ok the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are a bit on the high side and they could definitely use some help on keeping the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  clean  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  were dirty garbage on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END> 
 <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  Not sure what impressed me  <START:W_Price> more <END>   - the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  or the warm and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  Found Barrio Queen while walking around aimlessly  (I'm from out of town ) and was extremely pleased.  Tge fush  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  were hot,  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> ,  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  Accompanied by a Dos Sequis Amber,  I had a perfect combination.  I'll definitely be back.
Tried their shio ramen along with a side  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> .  After sitting down,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was taken quickly, and my hot  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  off three  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  before my  <START:Food> meal <END>  arrived.  From  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , things started going  <START:Opinion> downhill <END>  a bit.  I had to move myself to a different spot on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  because  <START:Food> it <END>  was so dark, I couldn't see what was in my  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END> .  The first sip of a  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of ramen did not trigger all those wonderful memories of  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  ramen  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END> .  For a shio ramen, the broth was definitely lighter in  <START:Food> texture <END> , not unlike  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  I know they say  <START:Food> it <END> 's stock from over 24  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiling <END>  black  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  bones.  But the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  is definitely infused with too concentrated  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  of a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of vegies.  And the after  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  hung around too long on the palates, not like the deep  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  after  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  from savory fats, but from something  <START:W_Price> more <END>  like MSG, or concentrated condiments.  If shio ramen is oil painting, I believe they  <START:Service> served <END>   <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:A_Decor> colors <END> .  My tongue was confused, and thirsty from the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and now that I needed  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END>  stopped coming.The high notes of vegies did not stop  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  curiously had a strong  <START:F_Ingredients> carrot <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  paste  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , unlike any Japanese  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> .  At the end, I had to ask the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> , is the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  Japanese?Like all  <START:Food> foods <END>  made with instant condiments, or chemicals,  <START:Food> it <END>  actually " <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> " pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  I do not have any evidence that their  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't go through long  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  of preparation so if I have offended anyone, particularly  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> , I do apologize.  But I do challenge that in the tradition of a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  ol'  <START:S_Cutlery> bowl <END>  of ramen, the convenience of offering customers, hey if you think  <START:Food> it <END> 's too  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  we have stuff to make  <START:Food> it <END>  heavier, or if too heavy, we have stuff to  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:Food> it <END>  down, etc perhaps is too wishy washy.  Take a stance on Ramen Sora's take of what a shio ramen should  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like and present us with That.
Lately, I've been telling people that Fukumimi is the best ramen around and beats Monta hands down. This was before I finally tried Ramen Sora.Earlier today, my friend said he was  <START:Opinion> tired <END>  of eating at home and suggested that we eat out for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . After some deliberations, we went  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . We arrived shortly before the 11:30 opening  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  a bit before walking in. We were the second  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  for the  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , which felt even better when I later saw people loitering in the  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  area before  <START:Food> it <END>  had even hit noon. Having browsed through some Yelp reviews (love you  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> ), I chose the Deluxe Sora Ramen ($10) with  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  broth, while my friend had the standard  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  Ramen ($7.50).A  <START:F_FI_Size> few <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later, heaven arrived. I don't know how else to describe the excellent, salty and umami broth, the al dente  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  (best I've personally experienced), the generous  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  (you  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  what you're  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for in this one), the chewy-but-not-too-chewy bamboo shoots, the green  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , and the seaweed squares. I did find the  <START:F_FoodItem> yolk <END>  of the soft- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  to be a bit runny compared to what I'm used to. Just based off the components that appear to be present in the normal  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  ramen, I would have been happy. I was smiling inside the whole  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .Unfortunately, my friend did not find his ramen as much to his liking. I could kinda tell by how much broth he left behind. His  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  complaint is that  <START:Food> it <END> 's too salty, and I agree that the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  is a very strong component. However, I happen to be pretty  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> -tolerant (at least compared to someone like my mom), so this is not a negative for me at all. If  <START:Food> it <END>  is an issue for you, then steer clear (or ask about clear broth on the side, I saw in another review).I was just so impressed today that I've decided that Sora is now #1. Fukumimi is still a very  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  second for me, with emphasis on the  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END> : if I'm leaving from home, then I want to pick Fukumimi for a shorter drive. If I'm around Spring Mountain and need a  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END> 's gotta be Ramen Sora. And I'm still smiling.
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  I've ever had.  How can you go wrong?  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to perfection with gruyere  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> caramelized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  and baconaise all nestled between a  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> .  Soooo  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !  My friend had the Drunk  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  crust sandwhich that was equally as  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  Can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back for dinner with my hubby!
 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  was just plain strange. Started by walking into a completely dead first  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  with about 4  <START:S_Staff> hostesses <END>  just staring at me. I walked upstairs to meet a friend at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and I swear  <START:Food> it <END>  felt like  <START:Food> it <END>  had the feel of an empty Applebee's. The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was also just pure insanity. If someone told me to come up with a mix of the crappiest songs from the fifties and the late eighties; I wouldn't have come  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to the poor selection they offered. After about twenty  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  of joking about  <START:Food> it <END> ; they changed  <START:Food> it <END>  to something bearable. Even though the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection was worse than the Citgo down the street; the  <START:Service> service <END>  was actually decent. Gotta hand  <START:Food> it <END>  to them- they were making the best out of a pretty  <START:O_Experience> bad <END>  situation. Not sure how this one gets turned around but someone let me know if that miracle happens and I'll give  <START:Food> it <END>  another shot.
I love  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> , I told my friend I had an urge for  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  suggested  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> .  This was  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  go to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and I can see why.  Its only sad because Seattle doesn't have an  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  like this.  Anyways, during my trip, I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice and was blown away by the  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> .  The heat rating system was new to me since  <START:Food> it <END>  went  <START:Food> it <END>  to 10.  I had 7 twice and might actually bump up to 10 next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> !  Both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , I got  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>  with some sort of protein.  My favorite would have to be the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  since I like  <START:F_Ingredients> stewed <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> .  This with the sides of almond slivers,  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  veg.  I feel refuel and  ready to tackle the Sin City again.
One of the best  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shops <END>  in Phoenix, but when the pricks behind the counter tell you they won't make you a doppio over  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> , I want to punch them straight in the baby maker. When I'm  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  don't tell me what I can and cannot have, I'm boycotting until they get over themselves.
My husband and I went to dinner at Tom Yum this  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  because I had a craving for Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  and remembered  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  had opened recently, so we decided to try  <START:Food> it <END> .  When we got in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  the ' <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> ' told us that we could sit where we wanted (from across the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ), but this didn't bother me as  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was on  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  way to put an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in to the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END> .Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and informed me as I received my  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  that earlier in the week the  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  and diet syrups were  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  up so if  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  off to let  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  know...  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  comped the  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  for me.  We were having a hard  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  picking what we wanted to try, so we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Satay as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  before we placed our  <START:Food> entree <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  came out right as we were  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  our  <START:Food> entrees <END>  (very quick).  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Broccoli  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  heat and my husband  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Pad Thai  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  heat.   <START:Food> it <END>  took longer than I had expected to get the  <START:Food> food <END>  since we were one of three  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , but we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  fairly late and  <START:Food> it <END>  seemed  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were only one or two people in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen>   kitchen?  <END> . When we received our  <START:Food> food <END>  we were blown away at how  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> !!  Both the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and our  <START:Food> entrees <END>  were phenomenal.  Perfect amount of spiciness, temperature of  <START:Food> food <END> , consistency of  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> ,  <START:Food> texture <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , etc.  Everything was perfect.  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very attentive throughout the entire  <START:Food> meal <END> .  All in all, Tom Yum surpassed my expectations and we will definitely be returning soon, and often, to enjoy  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Thai  <START:Food> food <END> .
Two  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  in a row!! Two!!  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:Service> service <END> , nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , excellent  <START:Food> food <END> , FREAKING  <START:Service> amazing <END>  Bloody Mary's....I've found a new  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  spot in Gilbert!!Our first visit was a  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>  for the hubs and I. He had been wanting to check  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  out but thought the only one that existed was in Arcadia. I mentioned I had driven by the one on Warner and since we had other plans in Tempe that  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , we decided to check  <START:Food> it <END>  out. We arrived around 9:30am on a Friday and were promptly  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> . During our  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> , an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  or so,  <START:Food> it <END>  really filled up.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the chiliquilles. I asked our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  what he recommended between those and the  <START:F_Ingredients> corned <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  hash. The  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  and I filed up quickly. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  stayed  <START:F_FoodItem> crunchy <END>  through the whole  <START:Food> meal <END> ...nothing worse than  <START:F_FoodItem> soggy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . Blech! Not wanting to get loaded first thing in the morning (and therefore sleepy), we chose to split a Mary's en Fuego.  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeno <END>   <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END> , Bloody Mary mix, bacon bits,  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  Bay rim. YUM!  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  and so, so  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> . Highly recommended.On the next visit we brought the kids.  They loved their  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> . This  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went with the  <START:F_Ingredients> corned <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  hash. Meh. Small  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  and not a lot of flavor. The chiliquilles is where  <START:Food> it <END> 's at. Oh...and another Bloody Mary.
I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and the pretzel fondue! Culinary is right in the middle of things in Scottsdale and  <START:Food> it <END>  is a fun  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> /dinner before a  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  out on the town.  <START:Food> it <END>  is trendy, upbeat and has live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on weekends, which can also make  <START:Food> it <END>  pretty loud. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  too, but not a ton of options for those (like me) who don't eat  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . I have never come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and not started with the pretzel fondue (they're  <START:Service> amazing <END> ) and my go to  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> item <END>  is usually the Ahi  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .
Love this  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  going to rage extremely hard and these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  support my drinking habits!!!
I don't understand how people can  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  so high. Came in greeters were awesome, was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  and then came the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  was alright a bit salty, the hit  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is the flaming fajitas which they douse in  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  oil in  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to  <START:A_Decor> light <END> . We did really enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  chile  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  however we did not receive  <START:Service> amazing <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  like most if the reviews. They took ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to get our  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END>  and soft  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , and the pina colada my dad  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  was pretty much  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  chunks and  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> . After receiving our  <START:Food> meal <END>  we had to flag them down to get refills and extra  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  or what not. Definitely not a high chance of returning.
Very clean eating. So many  <START:Food> food <END>  combinations that can be created  <START:Food> it <END>  would take a while to get through all of them.  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was patient with me since  <START:Food> it <END>  was my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . Will definitely eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again.
Middle America takes a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  from the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> -eating, wheatgrass-farting, vegan, Prius-driving type people on the coasts. But people on the coasts don't know what  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  barbecue is because, well, they don't have  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  barbecue on the coasts. To be fair, when  <START:Food> it <END>  comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , wheatgrass, hybrids and  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END> , Madison is  <START:W_Price> more <END>  similar to the coasts than Memphis, KC, South Carolina, or Austin. That is going to change when Blair Street Brew and  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>  gets fully up and running and people try the incredible stuff this  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  is smoking up in this  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  corner joint downtown. An  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  carrying in a pile of hickory sticks held the door open for us. Courteous  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:W_Price> more <END>  importantly, an actual smoker on the premises.  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  sign.We sat down at the well-stocked  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with a  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  selection of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> top <END> -shelf booze and Wisconsin and Midwest  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , and homemade, flavored  <START:F_Drinks> lemonades <END>  for the kids, teetotallers or the truly thirsty. Tangy, meaty  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are on the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . We received them as part of our combo platter because they hadn't gotten the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in yet. They had just opened for business in the preceding  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  or two. The "Badger Feast" claims  <START:Food> it <END> 's enough to feed a lineman. My son and I shared  <START:Food> it <END> . The two of us weigh about 220 pounds combined. We took 1/3 of  <START:Food> it <END>  home. Claim verified. The feast included: -  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END>  tips, with a 1/4"  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoke <END>  ring as pink as the cute, pig-shaped VW Bug delivery car  <START:A_Places> parked <END>  out front. They  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like heaven. Perfectly smoky, without one dry spot on the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Places> portion <END> .- bacon, smoky and peppery. I had one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . My daughter ate the rest. -  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END> , smoky and juicy if on the salty side, but that's  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END> , right? -  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and lean.  <START:Food> it <END> 's a work in progress on the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoke <END>  flavoring. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  said he's still perfecting  <START:Food> it <END> . Based on the rest of the feast, he'll perfect  <START:Food> it <END>  very soon. - the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  offers a perfect balance of seasoning, smokiness and tenderness. Easy to eat. No gristle or blubber. - my wife loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . You can read  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  review. This outstanding new entry to Madison's casual dining scene is in an unfortunate  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  that's been a graveyard for  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a key difference: the previous places, respectively,  <START:Service> served <END>  mediocre  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ;  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is  <START:Service> amazing <END> . If my wallet and arteries could take  <START:Food> it <END> , I'd keep them in business myself. Can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bbq <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> .
First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and absolutely incredible!! Definitely will be back, Carna aseda  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  was the best!They even have fresh Jalepanos !!!
When I walked in I was a little apprehensive,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is kinda a funky smell in the eating area but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> .  I looove their crust.  I had the pepperoni and also the house  <START:Offers> special <END> , the house  <START:Offers> special <END>  was fantastic.  My son loved the pepperoni.  My only complaints:   <START:Food> it <END>  took a while to get our  <START:Food> food <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was a little over greasy (to the point of being liquidy at some  <START:Restaurant> spots <END> .  None of that will keep me from going back though!
Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  now and really love  <START:Food> it <END> ! I usually go with the pep and sausage or just  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Love the  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  crust, zesty and tangy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  dough is fresh and the crust is crispy. Young  <START:S_Staff> female <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  Members are  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , attentive and not hard on the eyes (always a bonus).The personal  <START:S_Cutlery> pan <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  probably would leave a  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  Hungry  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> , desiring a bit  <START:W_Price> more <END> . Keep that in mind when  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> .Never tried delivery but hear they can be a bit slow and that they can get busy.Looking forward to trying some of the other  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Food> items <END> !
Had really  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> date <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , hummus, and Mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ) and the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is cute and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was a tad slow when we first arrived but  <START:Food> it <END>  was a busy Friday and our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was apologetic. Value was  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END> -- fiancé and I left stuffed and we each had two  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  for a tab of around $50. For the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  we definitely would have expected higher  <START:W_Price> prices <END> . We will definitely be back!!
My daughter and I really wanted Grimaldi's but didn't want to drive that far (or spend that much).  We thought we would give this a try hoping  <START:Food> it <END>  would be a  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  compromise.  We both  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  and I added  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  while my daughter added bacon and pepperoni.    <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  working was very nice and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> pleasant <END>  but they didn't quite seem to have the best system figured out yet.  The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  putting the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on didn't tell the next  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  so the  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  was skipped on both our  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> .  No  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  deal, I will just  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>   <START:W_Price> more <END>  attention next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  The first  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  with noticed  <START:Food> it <END>  after they  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and offered to fix  <START:Food> it <END>  but I insisted  <START:Food> it <END>  wasn't a  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  deal.  I appreciated the fact he said something (most people probably wouldn't say  <START:Food> anything <END> ).Now for the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .... OMG this was really really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !  And I mean really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !  The  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  really fresh and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was a really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> .  Without a doubt we will be back and I will be telling friends and co-workers about  <START:Food> it <END> .
After reading all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>  reviews we finally made  <START:Food> it <END>  into Phoenix to try out The Henry. I absolutely loved  <START:Food> it <END> ! The  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was not too extensive but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a lot of  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  to choose from. I decided on the 2  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END>  with bacon. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  scrambled and I think they may have been the best scrambled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  I have ever had. My hubby had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  which came with  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  were absolutely  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I liked that I was also able to enjoy a Bloody Mary with my  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  too. Our awesome  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  Adam told us that they actually have a build your own Bloody Mary cart on the weekends between 10a-2p. I am anxious to go back and give that a try. If this was closer to home I'm pretty sure we would be  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  a month. We will definitely be back even with the drive because  <START:Food> it <END>  was that  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , unbelievable  <START:Service> service <END>  and a cool  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> !
I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> -to-go 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  prior to  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and I didn't want to be one of "those" customers who  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  a lot right before  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END> .. but surprisingly,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a lot of people  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  to-go so I didn't feel as  <START:O_Experience> bad <END> !I got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> :1.  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  Chives Dumpling- its HUGE! I thought  <START:Food> it <END>  would be small so I wanted to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  4, but the  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  said  <START:Food> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  so I ended up  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  2..  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  call. Its really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> !  <START:Food> it <END>  was like an asian quesadilla.. lol.2. General Tso- TSO  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  (;3. Popcorn  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> - okay, i've had a lot of popcorn  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in my  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> .. but for some reason.. the seasoning on this  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is different. Its so addicting.. I ended up eating  <START:Food> it <END>  all before my boyfriend could even have some! He agrees as well.. theres something about their popcorn  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  that doesn't want you to stop eating  <START:Food> it <END> !4.  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  dumplings-  <START:Food> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like every  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  dumping.. its  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> , though!5. chive  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> - ehh, you can skip on that. its not  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  unless its fresh!I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  all this and they were so fast! We were in and out of  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in about 15 mins!I want to go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  their  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I heard they use only fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END>  and i'm a sucker for fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  smoothies!Overall,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is really  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  & I would recommend  <START:Food> it <END>  for late eats!
When I arrived I wondered what I was getting myself into since the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is attached to a strip club. I was hesitant to walk in but was very surprised at the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> .  <START:Food> it <END>  was like any other  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , nothing to do with the business next door. The head  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  came out several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to see if we enjoyed our  <START:Food> food <END> , Chris was also very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  with making our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  side  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END> . Everything we tried was so  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END> ,  <START:Food> it <END> 's hard to find  <START:F_FI_Taste> good <END>  mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  but this is one of a kind. You have to try  <START:Food> it <END> .
 <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent just had a delish dinner  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at Nacho Daddy on Sahara.  <START:F_FI_Taste> great <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  made better but our wonderful  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  Tammy.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was attentive, fun, and really wonerful. you will be lucky to have  <START:S_Staff> her <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  on you.
