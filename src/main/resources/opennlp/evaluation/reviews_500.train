I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  here...I've only visited in the past for  <START:Offers> happy   hour   <END>  or  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  out with friends. Recently, both times I came late in the evening after work functions and arrived hungry. Coincidentally, both nights I was there was also  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  night.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's an interesting  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> , all ages, just gettin' their  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  on. I enjoy the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> , but will sit back and let the "pros" do the dancing.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have friendly  <START:Service> service <END> , a few outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and a huge  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a pretty lounge-y vibe. There is a decent  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> / <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list, and also specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END> . Both times, I tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , which was not bad at all - not comparing to a Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but for a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was done well. The  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  one was really hot,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with a jalepeno: nice touch. I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the house  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which was a  <START:Food> meal <END>  in itself. Seriously  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was huge! The  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  were fresh, and with some  <START:F_Drinks> balsamic <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  oil,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very enjoyable. For  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  or  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  fare, Bossa Nova is one happening spot in the downtown area, which seems to be on the up and up!

MacAlpine's is a staple of old Phoenix. Dating back to the30's, this  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>   <START:Service> serviced <END>  customers of the valley since 7st was a dirt road off the beaten path.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do a  <START:Service> great job <END>  retaining the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  of an age gone by,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiched <END>  on both sides by antique and vintage stores. There's plenty to look at. Unfortunately I can't say the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  or cow) were very good. Not bad, just bland and uninspired. The  <START:F_Drinks> sodas <END>  are fun. On my first visit I tried 2 of the 99 options, including Marilyn Monroe (peach) and Tiger Blood (cherry  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END> ). Both were good, but next time I'm going to ask for way less syrup. All in all I'd say I would come back again and again, but probably just for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .

We came here last Sunday on Father's day for the  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for the  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> . $25 for the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  style for the cold items and $10 extra for the unlimited made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  small plates of 7 different hot items,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  not included. The  <START:Food> buffet <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> , 4 diff  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , assorted  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked   salmon   <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> caviar <END> , varieties of  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> . I am not usually big fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  at  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but theirs were really good and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfect. A bit disappointed that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put all the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimps <END>  on top but the bottom ones hidden under the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  ones were the small ones. The  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked   salmon   <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END>  were awesome.  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were very pretty and decent but mostly too sweet to my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were pretty good. We tried all the 7 hot plates to be shared among the 3 of us, the lamb was soooo delish that I had two  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and I don't usually even like the smell of lamb, but this didnt have the heavy smell. The  <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  were really good, except that I didn't quite enjoy the combination of the  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  bits on the  <START:F_FoodItem> waffle <END> . I also loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  mini  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . Polenta was yuck and the most raved  <START:F_FoodItem>   egg   benedict <END>  was not special. I didn't get to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , but hubby said the  <START:F_FoodItem> macncheese <END>  was good but  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was just average. We called ahead to let them know that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was also our anniversary and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would take note of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  didn't appear that any note was made. I know  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's only  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  and not full dinner but would still appreciate a bit recognition on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , so I ended up asking the host if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  could do something. So came an  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END>  plate with chocolate writing saying Happy Anniversary on  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and was told to get some  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  from the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  to put on the plate. May be that's how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I don't have complaint but was not exactly expecting an  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END>  plate :) Overall, I would have no problem returning there for a casual upscale  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .

What a find!!!  I drive by this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  all the time and always mentally say "humm Jess, you should try that  <START:Restaurant> place <END> " next time i am going to listen to my gut, because i was missing out!  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  is a very cute, cozy  <START:Ambience> set up <END> .  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is super nice here. You get complimentary won ton  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and delicious Chinese  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  when you get  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ( this is pretty rare). The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  which lead us into gluttony...and people i am NOT ashamed because  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was derrrlicious :)edamame, ribs, angel puffs(crab puff),  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> lemon   chicken   <END> , honey walmut  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  (catching my breath)..sake..more hot  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> ..and then  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  and chocolate for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ....yummmmhonestly i eat Chinese/Asian/Thai A LOT, and this was one of the best  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  i have came across in my quest for  great Asian  <START:Food> food <END> . why not  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END>  then you say?? well i am a fan of  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> (none here), and i just can't hand out  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END>  like candy. But def a high four!

Don't come for the  <START:Service> service <END> ...don't come for the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  or cleanliness...don't come for the other  <START:Food> food <END> . Come for the pie. Jack Daniel's Pecan is divine.  Lemon cream is outstanding. Rhubarb is top-notch. there's no other reason to stop here and if you're driving by you need to stop here.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all about the pie.

I am use to going here for teppan ( <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and have always had a good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Better than Benihana! <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and helpful.This was my first time here for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are great. I also love that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer half  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  on some of their  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Teriyaki w/  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Tempura, comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> miso   soup   <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was very tasty. And  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a good  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  for $8.50. I also got Unagi  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , which was okay. I got to sample around at some of my friends  <START:Food> food <END> ...Hamachi Kama which I've never had was yummy and the Uni  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  (wasn't as bad as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looks:)We also got different  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  at the end, the Chocolate Tempura  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  Cream was heavy but yummy,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like a funnel cake with  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream. The Chocolate Soufflé was delicious, the warm chocolate filling made the  <START:Food> dish <END> . My favorite was the Flan (yes at a Japanese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ),  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was reminiscent of creme brulee. The  <START:F_FoodItem> mochi <END>  wasn't great, might have been in the freezer too long.

While the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in this spot doesn't hold a candle to I Love  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Fever, the  <START:Service> service <END>  and half  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  make up for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  overall. I consistently have a great  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  here and have never had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . Plus, there is very little bullsh$t at the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  which is sometimes appreciated on a "school" night. The Hibachi is another story altogether,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is a tasty affair and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  is some of the best I've ever had! Most certainly  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a visit!

I've only been here once and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't busy so  <START:Service> service <END>  was not a problem when I went. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was soooo good! We had the pernil which was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> moist <END>  and delicious, tostones, maduras,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , moros y cristianos. Omg  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was awesome! I will definitely go back!

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> .  Wished we had found this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  a couple years ago when we moved here.   <START:W_Price> price <END>  is excellent and  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  very comfortable.  Found our new "Chinese  <START:Food> cuisine <END> !"

Dinner for 4.  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  was happy for the most part. My  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  was a little salty. Hubs  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was delish!  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  looked great and our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was nice.

I have been to Azteca many times and have always been satisfied. This time not so much. I can't put my finger on the reason, but I have to wonder if this time was an exception, or if the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had changed. Before this visit I would have  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rated <END>  Azteca 4, but now  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a generous 3.

I have just discovered the Common Market and I couldn't be happier that I did.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  reminds me of a funky little deli from back home so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gives me the warm fuzzies while I peruse their killer  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  a micro brew lover could want, including big bottles and single serve, build your own 6 packs.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also have a great  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  selection and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  even carry sake!  There are lots of  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END> ,  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  items, and organic choices, as well as off the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:Service> treats <END>  and trinkets like "Obama-mints."  I have never actually eaten at the deli, but I'm sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's great too.  Oh and you can also buy single cigarettes for 33 cents.....so, if you are craving just one, CM is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go.

After  reading the Yelp reviews, I went to Diamond around 3pm in the afternoon for a "snack".  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a surprisingly sophisticated  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bloody mary made with their house mix, absolut  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with pickled  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> .  As I am watching the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  make the bloody mary, she puts the cheapest  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END>  in the glass and then precedes to pour a mix over  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  which had a terrible  <START:A_Decor> color <END> !  I love a good bloody mary.  This bloody mary was no bueno -  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END> , crappy mix and no pickled  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> .  On to the  <START:Food> food <END>  - I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer>   fried   pickles <END> .  The  <START:F_Appetizer>   fried   pickles <END>  were good - the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were not.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were chewy, not  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  and dry.  Fast forward 3  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  and I feel terrible - in fact, I am in and out of the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END>  for a good 2 hours.  NEVER AGAIN.  If you're looking for good,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> , greasy  <START:Food> food <END>  try Pinky's!

The  <START:F_FoodItem> queso <END>  is ridiculously good... seriously. And the homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> tortillas <END>  are also outstanding.Aside from that,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  is average at best. As mentioned by others, this is Americanized Mexican  <START:Food> cuisine <END> . This is not autentica comida Mexicana, mi amigos!We had been once before and thoroughly enjoyed the  <START:Food> food <END> . Hence making  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a point to visit again on our most recent trip to Arizona.We started with the  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  set for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  - delicious. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bunch of  <START:F_FoodItem> queso <END>  for the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , and I started with a Tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hilariously underwhelming. I made the joke that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  scraps, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  looked the part.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  broth with a bunch of  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> , a gob of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and a small corn on the cob on top. Yes, a small corn on the cob is on top.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was lousy and I wouldn't recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a pound of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  and a half pound of  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee).  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  went surprisingly far for five of us... but the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  weren't grilled much, which is sad because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were otherwise delicious. Also, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  only had one piece of green  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  and one of red on top.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  should be lush with  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  that have been grilled or possibly even  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> caramelized <END>  (the  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ).Daniel E. wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be "more than a pile of  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> ," that he expected at least some green, red or yellow  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> fajitas <END>  were good and quite filling. The accompaniments were decent -  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , sour cream and the like. Nothing fancy, certainly no frills.So much potential, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  fails on almost  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a true shame. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  needs to be on  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible with Robert Irvine... badly...This time around... the  <START:Service> service <END>  was really lousy. And my fiancee found a bug deep down in her  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . Very disappointing. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  first replied confirming what size bug  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was, and then explained  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and claimed that "we're not dirty,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just the  <START:Food> food <END>  smell." Then she apologized and walked away. We think she deducted a  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  from the final bill... but nothing else. A bug!And the  <START:A_Places> entry foyer <END>  smelled like a high school locker  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ...  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was foul on the way in and out.Sad to say that we may likely not return in the future. I'm not sure if our  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and friends in the greater Phoenix area will either after the bug incident.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had the cheapest and best falafil (that is how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  spell  <START:Restaurant> it <END> )  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  of anywhere in town.The falafel was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> moist <END> , flavorful the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  was fresh and there was a copious  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  to cover  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  was a bit  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  but that can be over looked. At under $3  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might be worthwhile to get two. As for the hummous we had on the side,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a great texture but a bit low on  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . Make sure you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  an extra  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  comes with just one. We got the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to go so we did not really have any  <START:Service> service <END>  to review.  When you first walk in you are assaulted by the smells of many spices and many other alien things to most Americans. There is an attached small market full of spices, and exotics  <START:Food> foods <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice. The counter is full of many types of balaclava and  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> .If you want a great falafel  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  at a good  <START:W_Price> price <END> , be brave and stop in. Just leave your Pro Bush / Israel gear in the car.

Ok, I get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  that  <START:S_Staff> everyone <END>  is excited you finally opened.We (party of 5) came in today for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END> .After asking two  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  3 time for  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and half way thru my  <START:Food> meal <END> , I finally got  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> .  I also asked our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for the habanero  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  which I had to remind him again half way thru my  <START:Food> meal <END> .  After  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  our check 2 of decided to have a shot of corralejo tequila. I went to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where I stood for over 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  while the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  watched the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  ignoring me. I left and the returned, still no  <START:Service> service <END> .  I finally said in a loud voice to the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> . Quit watching the  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and get me our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . This is a terrible way to keep customers.  Not sure we will return.  $30 for 2 shots that I pretty much had to beg to get is rediculous.  Happy Holidays.

 <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the best BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  I've ever had in Las Vegas!!!! I also tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> pot stickers <END>  and orange  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> !! All  I highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to all who enjoy great  <START:Service> service <END>  and a relaxing dining  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> !

You can't really go wrong when you walk into a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a beautiful bottle of peppery Zinfandel and a decadent  <START:Food> meal <END>  with all your favorite things.  I was dazzled with my dinner choice comprised of a petite file mignon  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> topped <END>  with crab, drizzled with a crab mignonette cream, goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  whipped  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> asparagus <END>  fritti, sauteed wild  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and brussel sprouts sauteed in pancetta, lemon, and browned  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> .  Not to mention that I had the best key lime pie yet! Simply flavorful, simply  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , and simply a great choice to satisfy my craving for  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  Hats off to the Palm!

i always come here once a year for the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  bordelaise n pomme  <START:F_FoodItem> frites <END> !! Their  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  is the only one i would eat..  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are so  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  n tasty. <START:F_FoodItem> escargot <END>  is good.. for adventurous foodie... n not for the faint hearted... or country bumpkin who's not open minded to try anything at least once.the pate is good.. the  <START:F_Drinks> roasted butternut squash   soup   <END>  is good...

If you ever want to eat somewhere with delicious  <START:Food> food <END>  and have stunning  <START:A_OutsideView> views <END>  of the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  show at the Bellagio, this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to be!  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END> 's had incredible  <START:Service> service <END>  and appetizing  <START:Food> food <END> ! My boyfriend and I had our Anniversary dinner here and let me just say,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is one that I'll never forget. A few tips:Make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and if you don't mind eating a early dinner, make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for 5, that's when dinner starts. You'll for sure get a good  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  or  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> . <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , a nice dinner is not complete without a tasty  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  bellinis and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were perfect.Don't eat too much  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  because the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are pretty decent. From  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty hard for me to stop snacking on the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END> . But you want  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for their mouthwatering  <START:Food> entrees <END> ! I had the ricotta  <START:F_FoodItem> raviolis <END>  with italian sausage and my boyfriend had the goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dumplings with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , this was mainly where my 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  rating came from. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazingly delectable!!!!!!!

Never in my life did I  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  myself hitting up a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Vegas. What can I say.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  always seemed gimmicky I guess. So I crashed here for a night. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  was pimp and exceeded expectation. I had been driving all freaking day and in dire need of something delicious. No  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> , no  <START:F_Appetizer> snacks <END>  and screw eating shit from the mini  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . So me and buddy mosey on down to the   <START:Food> buffet <END>  while gawking at the numerous hot females walking around.Back to the  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was great first and foremost. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was just okay, bland and the selection of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  was pretty eh. Anyway not  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . The Prime Rib was really juicy and satisfied my craving for blood. The  <START:F_FoodItem> king crab legs <END>  were really good and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were mighty tasty. The  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  stuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  things were great, smothered in a creamy white  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Pesto mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , duck,  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> spareribs <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , dim sum,  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was really good and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  was overall pretty good. I left this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  feeling like a really content blob. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were pretty good. Nice  <START:Food> buffet <END> ... good enough to wipe my  <START:Food> buffet <END>  grudge away for the time being.

BASED ON  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  TO-GO:First of all, can we give a shout out to all joints that serve their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  all day? *applause* Already started off with 1  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> .2nd  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  came when we found out we could  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to-go &  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be ready to pick up in 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , smack dab in the middle of their morning rush. *High-five Lux!*3rd  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  came when we picked up our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  off to the side of the entrance where the bakery is and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  conveniently had other items like baked goods and all different kinds of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . I see you, Lux. I see you!4th  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  came when I bit into that scrumptious  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  sammich. That bad boy was huge! I thought I had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two of them or something. But don't me wrong, I still devoured that sucker,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  just took me a little longer. Only thing is that I wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put a tiny bit more effort into their hash browns. Mine were kinda bland and barely  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . Another off note: we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  ranch over the phone, when we picked up we also confirmed if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  packed the ranch ( <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did), but when we got back to our  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> , no ranch to be seen. Bummer cause ranch is my boo boo. Not cool, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  happens.Something to note- I'm not sure of its connection to The Cheesecake Factory:  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  used to be one?  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's owned by the same company? Not sure but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  definitely had the same vibe and I love me some CF so I ain't mad at  <START:Restaurant> it <END> !I would definitely come back!

We went here because we got a  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card for Xmas, I thought  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delish we stared off with the calamari was a little under seasoned but not fishy, the complementary  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was great and then we had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flatbread that was good the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was the nicest ever. We had a fifty dollar  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card and ended up using $38 on dinner and two  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and gave the rest to her for being super nice. Would go again even without a  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  card.

This review is coming from someone who was born and raised in HK. We have different standard on Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  than people from other culture. If you happened to be from an area outside of Canton/HK this review will not help you. This used to be my most favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Vegas for its high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  authentic cantonese  <START:Food> cuisine <END> ...yet the most recent visit proved to a a disaster...this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had lost its authentic cantonese  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , the pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  was saturated with gravy, my pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was over filled with sweet and sour  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was supposed to be dry), and the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  rib  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just gross.  <START:Service> service <END>  is ok; but I would say that  <START:Food> food <END>  had downgraded to American Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  style...I will not come back.

I love this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is beautiful and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is delicious.

Great creativity and fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> . Execution? Good, but not stellar. Most of us had luke warm  <START:Food> food <END> , but I was too lazy (since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt like forever to get our  <START:Food> food <END> ), to cry about  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and send  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. More like a 3-4 range, but the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and temperature were lacking.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do have an awesome smores mocha that you should probably share. Actually, share anything you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  because the portion will be monster. We came for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  on a Friday and had a short  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . Best thing was probably my friend's banana  <START:F_FoodItem> french toast <END> . That was tasty and the broiled (?) bananas were the perfect addition. Would I go again for that  <START:W_Price> price <END> ? Probably not. Maybe the San Diego sister  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  would be better....

Fun  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hangout at, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have this really cool bridge.........lol

My wife and I go here a couple times a year for quite a while now.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is very good, as is the  <START:Service> service <END> . I usually get the lasagna without looking much at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  The house chianti works well.   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's all certainly good enough that we keep going back.  The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is usually quiet, even when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is busy.  That means we can talk easily in a calm voice.On the nights that Augie is there with his accordion, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is usually busier, and I have to think  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's at least partly because of Augie.  He doesn't just play around with the squeeze box--he's Good!  He's a classically trained musician, and really puts himself into  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , especially when he knows you appreciate  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .

This review should be split into two categories:  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was 5- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .  Flavorful, generous, and delicious.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was 2  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .  Our party was one of two in the entire  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  Due to the fact the 3  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  in another part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  catching up, I had to get up and request  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and other things we needed.  From start to finish,  <START:Food> lunch <END>  for 3 people took close to 1.5 hours between  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  for  <START:Service> service <END> .  Always happy to find a good Ethiopian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and definitely recommend the  <START:Food> food <END>  here.  Just plan on the extra time for the  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  you will do.

Our favorite Mediterranean  <START:Food> food <END>  in the valley. Huge  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> swarms combo <END>  are our favorite. Also recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> roasted lamb hummus <END> . Phoenicia is awesome!

Great  <START:Service> service <END> .  We enjoy the  <START:Food> food <END> , but I believe the Naperville, IL  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is better.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seem to offer a larger variety of specials.  But, and thats a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  but, the Scottsdale  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is still a must try.  My favorite item is the Quinoa  <START:F_FoodItem>   veggie     burger   <END> .

I think I would have to agree with Kristin and Sunny and say that this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  gets a lot more credit that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  might otherwise deserve because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a non-chain, non-fast  <START:Food> food <END>  Chinese  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in South Phoenix. I admire the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  for taking a risk and opening this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in this particular area and for bringing some ethnic  <START:Food> food <END>  to the masses. That being said, the  <START:Food> food <END>  isn't spectacular. The first time my husband and I went there,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was at dinnertime and we thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  Honey  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  ($7.95) was a bit too sweet and not as  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  as one would hope, but the Mongolian  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  ($9.50) was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and pretty flavorful. We also had the Crab Puffs for $4.95, which were fine but no better than the ones at Panda Express. The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were low,  <START:Service> service <END>  good, and overall,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was an ok dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . However, when we returned for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today, we were a bit disappointed. Having enjoyed a  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  during the last visit, I decided to try the Volcano  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  special. My husband got the General Tso  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Their website says  <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials are $4.95, but I believe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were $5.50 each. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was ok, but again,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't that  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , General Tso  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and other similar  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are only really good if the outside is very  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  adds  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  not sogginess. The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that came with the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  and flavorful and the accompanying  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  (carrot,  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END> , and bok choy) were really fresh, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  itself was really bad  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . On the upside, the  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  that came with both  <START:Food> lunch <END>  specials was really good. The filling was savory, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  almost  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  in  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> ! I am certainly glad that the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  of Sun Asian  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  brought Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  to South Phoenix, but I hope that many more Asian restaurateurs follow suit and open  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in this area, so that Kristin, Sunny, and I have more options to choose from! Until then, I'll be frequenting Sun Asian  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  for  <START:Offers> happy   hour   <END>  (in particular, for the $3 crab puffs) or to-go and driving elsewhere when I went real, good- <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Asian  <START:Food> food <END> .

I went here today.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and was told  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're out of  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> .  Are you serious?  That's a first ever for me.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  was like $7.  That's an insane  <START:W_Price> price <END>  for a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  but I was hungry so I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END> .  I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  about fifteen  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  to come out and there was only one other customer in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  When the  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  finally arrived  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was cold and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't provide any napkins.  I was thoroughly disappointed and will not go back again.  Now I'm starting to feel sick.

All I can say is the horrible  <START:Service> service <END>  overrode  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  that could possibly have been good about the  <START:Food> food <END> .  The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  of this  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  was very cool and hip and had an abundance of open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>   <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  which was most welcome coming into phoenix from Michigan winter that same day.  However, our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> not good <END>  at all!  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END>  for over 10 mins. and when I needed a refill, because that was all I was drinking, forget about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I had to flag another  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  down while I could see my  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  rolling silverware.  We were eating with another couple and she never asked if we wanted the bill split either which I thought was unacceptable. Ok...for the  <START:Food> food <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  verde which was very flavorful and the cornbread that came with  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , I wished I had more of  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  My husband had the kale and Brussel sprouts and kale  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which he thought was very good but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  were just that, nothing special.  Even with the hen  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> .  The other couple we were with had been here several times and obviously have had much different  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  than we had because I don't think I would go back unless  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was for a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a pretty good looking list and the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  area had  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and  <START:A_Places> space <END>  to mingle.

One of my favorite things about Home Plate is that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type>   family   friendly <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining side <END>  and perfectly " <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> " friendly on the gaming side.  I only wish  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was smoke free on both, but I know that will never happen in Vegas.  Both sides of the  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  (separated by  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  glass  <START:A_Furniture> windows <END> ) have a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  number of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> televisions <END> ... some are a bit outdated and could use an upgrade, but big numbers just the same.  The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining side <END>  also has a small  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> arcade <END>  area which is PERFECT for bringing the kids, especially when the adults would like to hang out for a while, but the kids don't have the attention span to do so.  All of the  <START:Food> food <END>  I have had here (mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ) is excellent and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and good.  Definitely an once/month spot for us and would be more if we lived closer.

I asked for  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  mustard and Delvin over did  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I asked him to take some of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  off and he looked at  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  like how? I just told him take of the first layer and he did with his glove n  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  got messy.  Then he stick his hands in the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  with the same glove full of mustard. Smh! Then he tells me i have to ask for  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  mustard i said excuse me? Yes I did you didn't hear me.

I consistently have a good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  when I come here.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is quick and attentive,  <START:Food> food <END>  is good (edamame!) and overall good  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  We frequent this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when we want to have a decently  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  teriyaki bowl with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  is straightforward and tasty.  Plus,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  always have coupons!

For the  <START:W_Price> price <END> ... you can do much better.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good and the  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  was elegant, with amazing  <START:Service> service <END> .  I think of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  as a good date  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  if you have  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to blow and want to try to impress someone.  There are plenty of better  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  to go in Vegas.  Since its in a casino,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don't seem to have a dress code, despite its the kind of  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you would expect to have one.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was nearly  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END>  when we walked in... perhaps that was a clue that we should not have stayed.

Had a solo dinner here at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  while in town for business. First plus, the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  steered me away from a bad  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Redirected to the drunken sailor, I was a very happy camper after a long day of meetings. I followed  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  up with the  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END> /peach  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  and was even happier. I am a huge  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  fan (and make a darn good one). I usually do not like  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  varieties but this was intriguing. The two conventioneers next to me slugging Yuengling(don't get me wrong, I like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , but in a Cuban  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ?) were also intrigued.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was tasty and fresh.The  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  had excellent recommendations on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  as well. The Fire and  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  seviche was a winner, providing good  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and some nice heat. The  <START:F_FoodItem> empanada <END>  was a nice follow-up but the seviche starred.  Good  <START:Service> service <END> , good  <START:Food> food <END>  and all at a reasonable  <START:W_Price> price <END> .

Killer  <START:Food> food <END> . I only had one  <START:Food> dish <END>  out of about 12 things I tried that I didn't like.

I love that all of the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  here is fair trade and organic! This is a friendly neighborhood  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END>  which is often filled with families and lots of little kids.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also serve some  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  type  <START:Food> foods <END>  including  <START:F_FoodItem> bagels <END>  and cereal as well as somewhat fancier  <START:Food> lunches <END> . I've had better  <START:F_Drinks> cappuccinos <END>  elsewhere, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're acceptable here. Unfortunately, the WiFi is rather hit and miss -- sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  works and sometimes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't, but at least  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's free.

will  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go a few times before bumping to 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ....but first time was awesome!had to get the LV  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END> ...delicious. that sage  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  rocks. and the dill relish compliments  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  ridiculously well.  <START:F_FoodItem> dog <END>  itself was good, too. paired  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  w/ some cottage  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  w/ cayenne sour cream to dip in and a big cold sprecher root  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , on tap no less. <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a great looking  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (good selection of creative dogs, sausages,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and sammiches), nice selection of sides ( <START:F_Appetizer>   fried   pickles <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> green   beans   <END> !) and a surprisingly decent  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection (for a  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  grill). plus malts,  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END> , etc.and.... <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have vegetarian options. my girl is vegetarian....want to take her here so she can try a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  refinedReviews! (kinda curious about how a  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  refinedReviews  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  myself....)

Had a very poor  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  there related to customer  <START:Service> service <END> . Arrived to to get  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  for a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at 12:30pm.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would not take names and hold  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . There were  <START:S_Menu> limited <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  open at that time, but only two of eight in our party had arrived so  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  wouldn't  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us.  We mentioned our party was expected around 1.  Around 1  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  started a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  list and were not helpful when we asked to be listed on  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had not looked to save any  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  or opportunities to hold our group and were very rude when we asked again to try and be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .  The rest of our party showed by 1:15 and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  included 3 kids. At that time, there was nowhere for us to sit.   By 2pm,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had not followed up with us at all or tried to be courteous.  In fact,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very unprofessional during the entire process.  I complained to the management since  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  "had no idea" about how long  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be to try and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us. While I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for more than an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  still made no effort to hold smaller  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  open to try and accommodate our party.  By just after 2pm we said we were leaving and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  seemed shocked.  Was also very frustrated  <START:S_Staff> the manager <END>  did not really try to solve any issues and help us out.  I didn't even get to eat there but my co-workers had  <START:Food> lunch <END>  there other days and said their  <START:Food> meals <END>  were "OK."  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need to improve their approach to  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END> .  If  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  would have been more accommodating we would have been a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  party with huge  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> .  Instead,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ruined our day and their reputation among a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group of potential customers.

Totally enjoyable, every person that I have taken here is forever a fan of Honey Pig!The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Brisket and Bulgogi are sooooooooooooo good!!!

Fun  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  and pretty good  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was great, we kept having people join our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were very accommodating.

I LOVE the  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  here! I've been coming here every other weekend since moving to Montreal! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick and friendly. The  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  is casual, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a huge variety of chocolates at the front to purchase! I work nearby so I come here often to grab  <START:Food> lunch <END> , or a chocolate snack. The  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  is only served on weekends! I highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . I would come again and again! <START:Food> food <END>  -  Amazing! <START:Service> service <END>  - Friendly and quickAmbiance - CasualWorth the  <START:W_Price> money <END>  - Yes!

My favorite bistro in all of Montreal. From the great hors d'oeuvres to the fabulous  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> , this is a spot you just can't afford to miss. Located in the French quarter, l'express is a small  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that is lays packed and full of eclectic people.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing but be sure to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  l'ile flottante before  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sell out and don't forget the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  to finish off the evening.

Terrible  <START:Service> service <END> , very pretentious  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  for 20 min once and in the end  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  turned out  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot ! Sold me a day old  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> ...

My wife and I first went to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on Rea Road twice and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fantastic both times! We came to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's closer to us and because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a chain, we thought the  <START:Food> food <END>  would be just as good as the one on Rea Road. We were severely disappointed.

 <START:Restaurant> it <END>  an okay  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go for pho... Nothing "wow" factor....  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  was more  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ... Not to mention very little herbs given

As I've always wanted to go here, my fiancé surprised me by taking me the The Witchery for my birthday this evening. Maybe I came in with incredibly high expectations but I found that the hype of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  far outweighs what you get. I was not particularly  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with any  <START:Food> dish <END>  I received, to be completely honest. While the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is not "bad" by any means,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems as though  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's coasting on a name, rather than the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END> . The Witchery seems to do  <START:Food> food <END>  that is very classic, which is great if that's what you're looking for. However, I was expecting the classic  <START:Food> food <END>  to have something which set  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  apart from other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . In short, I saw nothing like that and was served a few fancy looking  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that were not nearly the calibre of  <START:Food> food <END>  I would expect from a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  this "legendary" or in such a  <START:W_Price> price <END>  point. I have eaten at several world class  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  and have experienced better  <START:Food> dishes <END>  at a fraction of the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  in more cosmopolitan hubs (Vegas, NYC, etc). Not only that, but I found the  <START:Service> service <END>  to be dismal overall. The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were very kind but not attentive enough. I recognize that there can be a cultural divide between American (which I find far too hands on) and British  <START:Service> service <END>  but this didn't even begin to straddle the line. We were left to our own devices with only a check in every half  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  (if that). The last straw, which I'm not sure was intentional or not, was that I wasn't asked if i wanted my credit card charge to be in dollars or pounds. For most people this isn't a big deal, but I travel enough to know that establishments make extra  <START:W_Price> money <END>  if one  <START:O_Payment> pays <END>  in foreign currency...I would think a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of this calibre would know exactly what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are doing when hey run something like that, which I find dishonest. The Witchery gets extra points for acknowledging and doing something sweet for my birthday but overall, I'd recommend people look to other  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  in Edinburgh for great  <START:Food> food <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  seems like a tourist trap that's lazy bc of their legacy. Personally, I felt  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a waste of  <START:W_Price> money <END> .

So I've never had Vietnamese Pho before (pronounced fu, as in fun, without the n) and I decided to try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with a friend of mine who speaks Vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and what I was eating and also steer me to the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in town so I'd have a positive initial Pho  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and want to go back again and again.unPHOgettable is tucked into an Asian cultural center just south of Main Street on Dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the Asian grocery story, but has  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's own entrance and  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> eating area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  had a pretty nice  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  was very helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (I figured  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  either eat there quite a bit, or the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  remembers him because he doesn't likely see very many tall, geeky, white kids who speak Vietnamese). The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  offered to go over the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  with us, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was our first time, but my friend told him that he would handle  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty clean and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very helpful. My only minor complaint was that there was a minor  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  odor in the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END> , but I wasn't quite sure if  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  or the adjoining Asian grocery store that had the fishy smell. Either way  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't overpowering and didn't detract from our  <START:Food> meal <END>  at all.I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  Pho with  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END> . I have to admit, that when I looked at the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I thought  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> tenderloin <END> , so I assumed I was  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  strips of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  junks.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  wasn't until my friend's wife repeated my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  with an emphasis on  <START:F_FoodItem> tendon <END>  that I realized what I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . Either way though, I'm pretty adventurous so I figured I'd give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  a shot. My wife  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a flat  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  instead of the  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  since she's had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before. The  <START:Food> food <END>  didn't take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of Pho with all the trimmings. I added a decent  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of hoisen  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and an even more decent  <START:F_FI_Size> amount <END>  of hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red. I added in my  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, tore up my  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  and plopped in my jalapeños to boot. I dug in and was amazed at how great  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> . I wasn't really amazed that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  good, but that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  SO good AND I'd never had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  before. Why had people kept this a secret from me?  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fantastic and right up my alley.  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> , hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . I wolfed mine down and even tried my wife's  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> , not really enough to give a thorough review, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was good, and I'd try  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  again.The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  weren't bad, I ended up  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  about $22 for the two of us to eat our  <START:Food> meals <END>  and a small  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  split between 4 people. Range: $7.50 - $12.00.Sorry for posting without pictures, but I'm sure I'll be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl.Because of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , I am now a fan of Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END> , specifically the Pho  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .Rating: 5.0http://dietstartstomorrow.com/post/2982603033/unphogettable-mesa

This will be my first visit to a Korean BBQ joint here in Vegas and I was delightfully surprised.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was fairly traditional with a decent selection (tripe was a nice addition). The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was attentive as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  needed to be; quick to switch out grill tops and refill  <START:F_Drinks> waters <END> , but that is rarely a deal-breaker for me at these  <START:Restaurant> places <END> . To explain to those that may have been to different style Korean BBQ's, this is the type that is  <START:Food> buffet <END>  style, not the dim sum style. I typically compare Korean  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  on their kalbi, and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  stacks up right around the 3  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  range. Having been to, in my opinion, some of the best domestic Korean BBQ's back in Queens, NY, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  filled the void rather nicely. I'll definitely return for my monthly dose of pig intestine, And for 18$ a head? Gun bae!

I came upon Paradise Bakery by chance and just stopped by to have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and something sweet. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a caramel  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> snickerdoodle cookie <END> , and a  <START:F_Dessert> sugar cookie <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all okay, but not fantastic. I think  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a little pricey for what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is. The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  was pretty nice and seemed like a nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to study or read, but I probably wouldn't choose to go back.

This a great deli, by airports standards or otherwise.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a fairly  <START:S_Menu> limited <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  There are  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> wraps <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and prompt, which is great when you're rushing to a flight. Try the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  and cranberry  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is great! This is my go to for a quick  <START:Food> meal <END>  before heading to the security line.

 <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  were good but apparently  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn't want to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the rent.  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is closed, locked up with a sign saying the lien holder has taken over. Guess I have to find a new  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now. Damnit.

Went here to break Passover this yearWhat we sampled:  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sampler      Definitely a good way to try different  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , to get an idea of what you like. I was really interested in the Hefeweizen with  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of banana and clove.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was definitely interesting smelled like bananas and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like cloves.  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  sample     The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and pretzels were great and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sauerkraut balls <END>  were definitely interesting.  I wasn't such a big fan of the potato  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  though.  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  spatzel     Total winner of the night.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was awesome. Apple Streudel     A classic, though I don't know if I would  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  again.  Not really my thing.  <START:Service> service <END>  was great and helpful!

Good Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  good a little on the spicey side. Kind of small could've been bigger. Good   <START:Service> service <END> .

Good  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> , but like a previous comment,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  gets harder and harder to keep going back.  The way  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  process  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  is annoying, but that's not a deal-breaker if the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  I've  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  mostly.   <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>   <START:W_Price> cost <END>  extra.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  isn't remarkable.  Overall the  <START:Food> food <END>  is just okay - good enough to stop by if  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's on the way to somewhere else -  <START:O_Experience> not good <END>  enough to make a trip specifically to dine there.

I was really unimpressed.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get a weak 3 based mainly on the  <START:Service> service <END>  which was the strong point of the visit this morning.Arriving about 8 on a Thursday morning the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was about full.  Given the choice between a booth and the counter I chose a booth.   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  decaf which there was afresh pot brewing and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came in a few  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Country  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  (normally $5.99 but was the daily special at $4.99) with 2  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , a split biscuit with gravy and 2 slices of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> .The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  were ok.  I prefer a sausage gravy rather than the  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  gravy  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  make but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was ok.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was tasty but  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and not lean.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were runny in the middle.The building and  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  was showing a lot of wear.  There ware a lot of regulars even after the morning rush of folks heading off to work.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was really good and friendly.Overall this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was a reasonable value in that you could get a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  at fast  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  with  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .  Not sure I would make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  part of a regular rotation but I may stop again because of where  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is in relation to where I travel.

I used to think Sephora was my "Happy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ," but that was until I went to Hough's.  Hough's is my happy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , and also you can't  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  at Sephora.So.Many. <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> !  At reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> !!!  Every time I leave the Sharp Edge I feel like I've left the bulk of my personal wealth there.  Not at Hough's!   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  that's good about the Sharp Edge, and you're not going to go broke.I also really liked that the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  list was seperated by brewery, bc I am a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  snob.  Not a fan of Dogfish, but I do love my Troeg's.  I also really liked that on the back of the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer descriptions of each of the different  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  so you can sound like you know what the hell you are talking about when discussing the random  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  you've just  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> .  "I like the fruity finish of this Kolsch.  I believe this brewery is from a small basement in a small upstate NewYork town you've never heard of!"Pro tip:   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's winter.   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a black IPA or a Winter Warmer, don't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a Kolsch.  Ever.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are just  <START:O_Experience> not good <END> .My current favorite  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  at Hough's is 21st Ammendment Fireside Chat.  Try  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  You'll love  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .   <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is my "thing" and I know what's up.  You'll like  <START:Restaurant> it <END> , trust me.  I had a lot of  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were good.  The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was knowledgeable, and according to my friend (a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> ), she was also hot.  He appreciated that.The only thing I didn't like was the cold  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip.  There are certain  <START:Food> foods <END>  I call, " <START:S_Staff> guy <END>   <START:Food> foods <END> ."  Stuff  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  love and chicks are grossed out by.  This was one of them, bc my friend ate the whole thing while I poked at  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and said, "Is this just a block of cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  with shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  mixed in?"  I'm pretty sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was.  But my friend loved  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .I'll def be back, and you should go there too!

Ate here on our trip to Vegas last year using a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .com certificate.  Gotta love the  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  that let you include liquor the coupon.  We each had a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END>  that was delicious and not weak.  We shared the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  nachos that were excellent.  Shared a couple other  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  that also hit the mark well.  A bit small of a  <START:A_Places> space <END>  and you get to know your neighbors well.  Great deal with the certificate.

Well call me Sheila and throw another  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  on that barbie. Ok, so there's no Australian connection to Treacle, but the King Prawn  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>  box I had here today was by far the best  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , and the best EVER  <START:F_FoodItem> king   prawns   <END> , I've ever had. We're talking about all my culinary dining  <START:O_Experience> experiences <END>  internationally here, and I've done all the whole med- <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  scene ample times.The  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were fresh off the barbie, really charred and flavoursome and juicy and mmm. Seriously, just...if you like  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END> , go and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  that  <START:Food> dish <END> . I want another one now, and I only had  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  3 hours ago. As far as  <START:F_FoodItem> noodle <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  go  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was better than any chinese takeaway I've had too. So, as far as my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of Treacle goes,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a pub and a gastro-pub, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is exceptional. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  doesn't give that away.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  has the standard pies,  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , open  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  etc. and doesn't seem to hint that  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 'll be anything other than good pub  <START:Food> food <END> . But ohmylord.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  I've had here has just been exceptionally well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  deserves every single one of these 5 sexy  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> .I can't recommend  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  highly enough for delicious pub grub. Read my other reviews of  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  previously for an idea of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . I am now definitely one of its biggest fans.

This is one of my all time favorite  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spots near my work. My girlfriend introduced this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to me a few months ago when I was craving Viet  <START:Food> food <END> . She encouraged me to try the bahn mi  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  I immediately fell in love. As I got to explore the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .. I quickly found this spot to have some the best pho I've ever had.. from living in California to now recently residing in Vegas. The rare  <START:F_FoodItem> flank <END>  is awesome especially when you get  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  served on the side instead of already mixed in the broth allows you to drop in at your leisure to get soft "rare" slices of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> .. very flavourful! ..Great cure for hangovers! I really enjoy the bbq  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are amazing (always fresh). The peanut dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  for the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  is definitely on point and is a must try if you eat here. Also the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are very reasonable and just a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for friends and  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  to get good local Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END> !

I was really  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  at Sage Garden!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  catered a meeting for us and  I thought their  <START:Food> food <END>  really stood out: <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came in (on time) and set  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  all up for us in a timely/professional manner (as  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a working  <START:Food> lunch <END> ) <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> - Excellent, I had  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  & swiss although  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , ham, and I believe roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  to choose from.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all served on soft croissant  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  A veg option would have been great and some individual mustard/mayo's rather than a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  one for all to share ( the germaphobe in me would have appreciated  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .) <START:S_Staff> they <END>  provided potato  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which was DELICIOUS! Red  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , green  <START:F_Ingredients> onion <END> , mayo -based, non-sweet, with almost a hint of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was really good.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also gave us some incredible chocolate brownies, which were just so good I wish I grabbed one more before I left. Overall the  <START:Food> food <END>  was really delicious-  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a step above many of the other franchised options. Fresh and tasty, just the way I like my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to be : ) I'd highly recommend them.

Of Wolfley and Man! (Metallica Reference!)I came here for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with an associate and I wanted to try something new. Wolfley's was definitely something you can't find anywhere in the country so what the hey! I would have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  their hometown favorite roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  warned me  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was quite salty.  I'm glad she did since I don't take kindly on overly salty  <START:Food> foods <END> . So I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheeseburger <END>  sliders instead. Let's just say I wasn't sure if should have sucked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  up and tried the roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  instead. Sliders were, well sub par and basic.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty dry and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came along with some  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> onion <END>  flakes. I needed to douse  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  with some ketchup to help me swallow  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . My  <START:Food> meal <END>  also came along with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which was probably the better of the two. However, I found a few brown leaves and tried to work around  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was good overall and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty well put together. Definitely a cool  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang with the boys for a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . I went on Wolfey's website and notice  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are fond of charitable work and non-profits coming to their  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  - Kudos! Then again in my honest opinion I'm not sure I would want to recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  unless  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . - Enjoy!

The strip mall exterior belies the treasure within! When you enter, you're immediately  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  by the smell of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Normally the smell of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is not a pleasant one for me. As in, makes me lose my appetite. So,  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a huge compliment when I say, the smells coming out of the open  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  are mouthwatering. When one of my dining companions received her  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END> , there were yet more mouthwatering aromas. WTH kind of alchemy is going on in that  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  make this vegetarian salivate over dead animal? No matter, fellow lovers of the plant plate, there's options for you here. For starters, you *must*  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the Brussels sprouts ( <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do come with panchetta, but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  can be left off). DIEvine. Seriously. As are the roasted root  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> . I love when something simple is so delicious.I normally never eat mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's so two-note (duh), but Beckett's  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  makes  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so that I finally *get* why people are all gaga over this stuff.  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's very subtle, but those mustard seeds take the  <START:Food> dish <END>  to a whole other level of delish bliss. My  <START:Food> entree <END> , the oven roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  tower was probably the least exciting thing I ate last night night, but still flavorful in its own right and beautifully plated. I'm just not a fan of roasted  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  which comprise about half of the stack. I'll leave this tiny meh at that, because the entire  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  blows that away into the ether. Next up,  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . Although thoroughly stuffed at this point, I managed a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> potato pie <END>  (incredible), the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry cobbler <END>  (delightfully tart, balanced with a sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cream) and the piéce de resistance, fig (yes, I said fig) and  <START:F_FoodItem> pecan pie <END> .I'd be remiss to not mention the  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  list, which seemed quite creative.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard for me to choose, but I had the Az Farmhand, which has Hendricks gin,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> , ginger,  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  and honey, many of my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  did not disappoint. Fabulous selection of wines by the glass, too.A thoroughly lovely  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  from start to finish, Beckett's  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  provides top notch  <START:Food> food <END>  at affordable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> , with impeccable  <START:Service> service <END>  in a rustic  <START:A_Environment> environment <END>  (you feel like you're in the hippest, coziest lodge).

Too bad the  <START:F_FoodItem> bagel <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> schmear <END>  were delicious, because the  <START:Service> service <END>  was terrible. When I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  my  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  +  <START:F_FoodItem> matzo <END>  ball (which was alright but not  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  $5.99) I asked for  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  in the plastic container to go, I was argued with, being told the paper like container was more safe and better for  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> ... <START:Restaurant> it <END>  promptly spilled because the lid wasn't tight enough, and in my car.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  looks amazing when you walk in and feel like you have entered a 70's  <START:Food> diner <END> . Then the longer you spend there the less amazing  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  became. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is terrible and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took forever to get our  <START:Food> food <END> . I made my own  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  but found the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  has no seasoning at all, just  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  made into a patty and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were not bad but the mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was  <START:O_Experience> not good <END>  at all,  one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  was enough for me. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  looked good but i am sure  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was like most of the stuff in this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Looks great but leaves a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in your mouth.

We initially wanted to go to Wicked Spoon for the  <START:Food> buffet <END> , but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were about to close to prepare for dinner. We saw Holsteins along the way and decided to check  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  out. We both got the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , which was okay. My son enjoyed the  <START:F_FoodItem> mini sliders <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was decent, but maybe a bit overpriced, mostly likely due to  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in the Cosmo. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was fantastic and really catered to our kids needs.

 <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was pretty much all  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  and barely any  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . My boyfriend got sick from the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  he had. Won't go back.

This was hands down the best  <START:Food> meal <END>  I had during my recent trip to Phoenix.Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was very friendly and helpful - walking us through the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , making suggestions, and just being overall very pleasant.My husband and I started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Belly Pastrami, which was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and delicious.  We scarfed down the whole thing.For  <START:Food> entrees <END> , I went with the  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  were nicely prepared, but I could have eaten a whole bowl of just the  <START:F_FoodItem> grits <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> . Mm - so so good.My husband had the  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>  which were definitely the right way to go.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were delicious.And, even though we were both too full to move, I really wanted to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  pudding, so we went for  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  So.  <START:W_Price> worth <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  The only unfortunate thing was that at 8:00 on the Sunday night before Columbus day, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was pretty much  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END> .  I would have expected more of a  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END>  -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  felt a little ... i don't know..not happening. But, despite the lack of a  <START:A_Env_Type> crowd <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  stands on its  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in AZ

Amazing little  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have some seriously wonderful  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> . You can't go wrong with the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  board, the  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbreads <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> charcuterie board <END> , or the  <START:F_FoodItem> warm brie <END> ...  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're all to die for! OH, the  <START:F_FoodItem> olives <END>  are great too! I wasn't thrilled with the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  to be honest, but that was my only disappointment. One more thing I was simply so bummed about was  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  discontinued the rock  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and that was my FAVORITE. I still ask every time I go in just to see if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will bring  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  back. :) You just cannot beat the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection, the delicious  <START:Food> food <END> , and the great  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> . This is a must try!

I was driving down Buffalo and came across this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Boy am I glad I stopped by.OMG! This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the bomb diggity! Never expected the  <START:Food> food <END>  to be so delicious!   <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's like an explosion of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  in your mouth! The red  <START:F_FoodItem> velvet pancake <END>  is to die for. I'm from Hawaii so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a surprise to see Hawaiian  <START:Food> dishes <END>  served here.  To all the Hawaiians in Las Vegas this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  give Cinnamons  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  HARD RUBS! Plus  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve Zippy's Chilli here!!! I tried the Adobe  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  Omelette and the Kailua Pig Benedict! A+ in my books!The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was wonderful! Very friendly and very prompt.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  filled our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  when needed and provided a smile every time  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came by.  I know this is random but their  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  was so good! Very Cold and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh! That is also a plus for me when checking out a new  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  as you know you don't always want to get  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . So rest assured if you want  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  here your gonna have a good one.  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is very reasonable for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  your are going to receive.  The  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are more than decent to get you full and possible end up taking some to go!I had a great overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as a first timer.  I don't live next to this area but with the results of having a friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , amazing  <START:Food> food <END> , and decent  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  I will not hesitate to take a drive to eat here again!

First visit to Emzy last weekend and my wife and I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a little weird when we arrived around 7:45 on a Saturday night and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was dead. I was worried the  <START:Food> food <END>  might not be good, but I have to say that  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was great! We both eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  all the time and we had some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  here at Emzy. I am not sure why the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed out with patrons. The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is trendy and cool, the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  great. I have to assume that the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , not near Trade and Tryon or the Epicenter, are the only reason  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was mostly  <START:A_Env_Type> empty <END> . Well, that is a shame. If you like  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not to be missed. We loved the Drunken  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> , and especially loved the Sweet 18  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> !  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's a bit pricey at $16, but the Sweet 18 was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  every  <START:W_Price> penny <END> ! The  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>  Tuna Ball small plate was excellent as well. If you're a fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , I would recommend Emzy for sure!

I got the three  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  on my first time here. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was just wonderful.

This is the 3rd  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  I've tried out.  <START:F_FoodItem> pita <END>  Jungle does NOT disappoint!  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  about their  <START:Food> food <END>  is consistent. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly. I wish we had these  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Florida.  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> five   stars   <END> !

I am a native Phoenician and Mexican American. I was shocked to find this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  serving such authentic Mexican  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was similar to my Mother's cooking. Try the seafood with Mojo de Ajo ( <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ).  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  added peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  to the Mojo de Ajo and this was truly a delicacy know  to very few locals.Try the Dos Amigos ( <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> ) - $13.25. The  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  are the 2  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>   Man and Wife. Beautiful  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  and very pleasant young  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END> /waitresses  12-29-12  looking forward to 2013

Amazing pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ! The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was charred and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  just right. The sides are huge  <START:A_Places> portions <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> poutine <END>  was pretty tasty but not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ! More  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just right.

45  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for undercooked  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>  (so called tiger  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> )  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  platter came with plastic wrap around pieces of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  my favorite  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  had literally 10% of liquor and the rest was  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   ...wanted to impress my boyfriend with some classy Italian  <START:Food> food <END> , so I did!

Favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>  in Charlotte. If I hadn't lived in Chicago previously, I might say my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> hot   dog   <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ever. I love the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  both  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END>  and out, but you can't beat the rooftop deck. With this building's bad reputation for keeping tenants, I hope JJ's can make  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  for the long haul. I'm a big fan.

The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  must be doing something right, since  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was crowded.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was acceptable, but not exceptional.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  (Maple  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and Tiramisu) were  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  with topping on top, not wrapped within as one normally does for a  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> .  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  or so for the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  to come out, and the presentation of the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  seemed rushed--toppings were just sort of dumped on top of the folded  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> , like  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was prepared by someone in a rush.  I suspect  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did not have a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  floorspace or  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  adequate to meet demand.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and considerate and the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was pleasant.  While not terrible,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was not really  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  or the  <START:W_Price> price <END> .  I doubt I will go back.

Bacchanal  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is located at Ceasars Palace.I'm a victim of expecting a grand feast from this mega  <START:Food> buffet <END> , only to have my expectations shattered like a huge mirror hitting a concrete floor. Fellow Yelpers raved about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> .  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and friends that had gone, had also raved about  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . So naturally I bookmarked  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  and anxiously awaited my time to feast like a king at the " <START:Food> buffet <END>  of all  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> ."Upon arriving at the entrance to the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was already clear that we came during the dinner rush. The line was insanely long.  Fast forward 1.5 hours later and we were finally  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> inside <END> ....oh yes,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took us 1.5 hours of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  & $50+ per person to get in. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is freaking huge.  <START:Food> food <END>  on  <START:Food> food <END>  on  <START:Food> food <END>  &  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  on  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  on  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . The  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  was pretty and oozed of opulence for a  <START:Food> buffet <END> . We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  relatively close to the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  station. The entire  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a blur, there was a lot to choose from ( <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END> , ethnic  <START:Food> foods <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> , sides,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , soups, etc) and yet nothing specific comes to mind about what was the best at that  <START:Food> buffet <END> . However, I did enjoy the crab legs and the choice of either cold crab legs or boiled crab legs; which were boiled fresh upon each  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . The only thing I didn't like about Bacchanal was the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Ambience> set up <END> . The majority of the  <START:Food> food <END>  stations and the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  station were located in the same  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> ; but the crab legs and the majority of the Asian  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  were located in a separate  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END> . I suppose this is my  <START:Food> buffet <END>  pet peeve and the worst offender is the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at Mandalay Bay, where the majority of each  <START:Food> food <END>  station is sectioned off in its own  <START:A_Places> space <END> @!&$# LOL I digress. I'm pretty sure the long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  left a bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth making my expectation of the Bacchanal that much more important. Would I come back to Bacchanal? Yes, to give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  another shot, BUT will need to time my next visit so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  doesn't coincide during the rush -_-

We had tickets to the Mercury  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  and were trying to get away from the crowds when we stumbled upon this amazing little  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> shop <END> !We both had chubby  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  with ranch  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an Oreo Shake. Prepare to be wowed. I don't know what  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is about this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is an  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> it <END> . Plenty of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  mixed with the freshness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and soft  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>  whole grain  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ....well  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's just indescribable and also very affordable!You need to visit soon!

Decided to go here instead of my normal Chipotle fix. I had the roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  club., <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was loaded with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  but definitely not eat. Just a few slices of each and maybe  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was hard to tell under all he  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was really tasty, seemed fresh! The   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> chips <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was just over $9. A bit pricey for what you get. There are some other  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  shops motto far from here that have better  <START:Food> food <END>  at a better  <START:W_Price> price <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  seems this store just opened. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is prepared super fast. I will give  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  another trying few weeks to see if this was just a new opening hiccup.

We just came from having the BEST  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  we have ever eaten.  We had the Sicilian and added artichokes.  Unbelievably delicious, Artisan style and fresh.   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was wonderful.  The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> / <START:S_Staff> cook <END>  and entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  made their way over to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  just to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sell homemade french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and rosemary/kalamata  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>  french  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  Took two loaves home.  Don't listen to one word negative about the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END>  or  <START:Food> food <END> .   <START:Restaurant> it <END>  really was delightful. fyi:  to Lenne O from Denver...  You must have been in the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  across the  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot because 1)you do not serve your own beverage  2) there isn't a chalkboard and 3) you don't prepay or pre-tip.  None of that...

The  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  here was average. I went with a healthier option on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and did not get my  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END> , I got the kabobs. There was nothing special about the  <START:Food> dish <END>  BUT the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  properly. I would go back here and try something different. Also great  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  from Forest Gump!!!

You'll feel like you're eating in a Havana Bistro with a Cuba Libre on the side and expect a hand  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>  cuban cigar to follow your  <START:Food> meal <END>  under palm trees.  Which leaves one massive mystery: I've never seen a cuban cooking, serving,  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , or eating there.  I'm not sure a cuban has ever so much as walked by Saluds door.  Yet, magically,  <START:Restaurant> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  was teleported over from Fidel Castro's personal  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  right to your Pittsburgh plate.Incredibly fresh  <START:Food> dishes <END> , high on  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was genuine and warm, and the  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  even offered us holiday  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  his wife made as a  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  for free just to be friendly.  The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is totally standard Lawrenceville/Pittsburgh  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , and has no hint of the cuban  <START:F_FI_Taste> deliciousness <END>  that is conjured up in their  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a solid craft brew list with a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  number of rotating bottles and drafts, and reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  across the board.I'd love to see the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  match the excellent cuban  <START:Food> food <END>  and strong  <START:Service> service <END> , but I'd gladly come back either way.  For great cuban  <START:Food> food <END>  at great  <START:W_Price> prices <END> , Salud, I salute you!

I decided to come here after driving past  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  so many times. The first thing I noticed was their dull  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , no creativity what so ever. I'm a graphic designer so for me precentation means a lot. Anyway, I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> tripa <END>  and an  <START:F_FoodItem> al pastor <END> . I was the only one there, and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took them a good five  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  to prepare them. Not only that,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  messed up my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  gave me a  <START:F_FoodItem> cabeza <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> tripa <END> . Very disappointed. If I ever come back I'll know what to expect.

I really wanted to love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ....especially from the good reviews and because we drove from Henderson just to go and eat here (about 45 minute drive).  We went for  <START:S_OpenHours> brunch <END>  on a Sunday and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  did not seem too busy.  There were plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  available and there was a small line to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  take your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at one counter and then you  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  in line to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  at another counter. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  and then stood in line for about 15  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  before we could even  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  The  <START:Ambience> set up <END>  is just not expeditious in any way.  We got a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for our  <START:Food> food <END> .  There were four of us; 2 people in our party received their  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in about 35  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> ....the other 2 received their  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  in about 50  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .....which was over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  from when we first made our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a Benedict and a 3  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  (total).....so over an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  seems completely unacceptable to me for such a small and simple  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  The Pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Benedict was good and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was nicely  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END>  but their Cuban  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was flavorless.  I was so hoping that  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  would be good enough for the  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  plus  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> ....but I was really disappointed.  We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a side of  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> ...but  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a small plate of about 10  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END> , small slices.  The portion was really small for a  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  side  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were also MEH.....nothing special and no seasonings or herbs at all.  To be honest, I would not make the trip across town again with so many better options.

My wife and I just happened to be at Starbucks when we decide to try Taco Guild. Once arriving we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  very quickly. Unfortunately  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was at a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  that hadn't  been cleaned (kinda gross if you'd ask me) which shows a lack of communication between who ever is cleaning the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and who ever is sitting them (or  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  couldn't care less where  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sat my wife and I). The  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and chairs are booth style so  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was a bit uncomfortable for me. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very nice and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  us very warmly. Unfortunately (and I might attribute this to a busy night on his end) we weren't really told about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Once the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  left my wife and I felt as if we knew nothing more about Taco Guild then when we sat down, this could have been excused if this  <START:Restaurant> places <END>  had been open for a couple of months but this was the third night  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was opened. All in all the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was great  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  came out quick and hot and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  seemed to have adjusted better and was accessible more and more throughout our  <START:Food> meal <END> . I recommend the Taco Guild the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great at the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is killer and I'm very excited to see if there are any sports nights or weekends coming up at Taco Guild. If you're a selective eater please make sure to ask questions (next time I'll take my own advice as well). Please see below for a personal side note...*The  <START:Food> meal <END>  went fine and I seldom felt a I need to call my  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  over. As we were leaving a man which I presumed worked there (he was standing around looking at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  and standing with the host and what I assumed to be the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ...or maybe he was the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) went to the door and held  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  open. What I hadn't realized was that he was holding  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  open for a couple (white and in there 50's maybe) coming in and not for my wife and I (Hispanic and white respectably) which were going out. The man after noticing my wife and I motioning towards the door continues to motion the couple which was entering to come in. Awkward at best this situation left a poor  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in my mouth.

Great  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  but bad  <START:Service> service <END> .  Sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and pretty much had the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  thrown at me.  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  took about ten  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  to notice me after I had a chance to review the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was my first time there and probably my last. Sucks because I was really excited about going there.

back already!  My husband had the really  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  combo, and I had a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  enchilada and  <START:F_FoodItem> taco combo <END> .. I must admit, the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was really tasty.   <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END> , but not overpowering.  the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was not really that  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  say all their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is  <START:F_Appetizer> spicy <END> .Next time, I'll get the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  too.good  <START:Food> food <END> , smiling  <START:Service> service <END> , clean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .

I have to admit, I wasn't particularly adventurous with my  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  when I ate here last week. We arrived around 12:30 and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was pretty busy.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are still offering their regular  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  for 50% off so I got a few off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to try. My dining companion  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  special, which was also a pretty good deal. The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  was all pretty fresh and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were made well. I would have given them 4  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  if  <START:Service> service <END>  was a bit better. I know  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were a little busy, but  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  went unfilled and our  <START:Food> food <END>  came out slow. Their AYCE  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were reasonable and I have a Groupon burning a hole in my pocket, so I will be back. Looking forward to trying more items off the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Both the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  items look enticing.

The  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  are extremely nice and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is quite delicious. Nice, Authentic, and a great  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the Middle East.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  absolutely lives up to its  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> ! Amazing  <START:Food> food <END> , amazing  <START:Service> service <END> , and adorable pens shaped like chopsticks holding nigiri :P The special with sea bass and  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>  salt was my favorite, but the trout with pop rocks and the tadas were amazing too.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  we has was fresh and delicious. But whatever you do, don't ask for Louis... He's mine!

I've been to Pomo for several company outings and for dinner dates. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  never wavers whether I'm there with two people or twenty -  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  is always an excellent visit with knowledgable  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  and delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> . Any of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  are absolutely delicious as well, I wouldn't hesitate trying a new option here at all. Definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a visit, don't miss the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  in cooler weather!

Clean and friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Had the Dac Biet  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  and spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Overall, tasty, would recommend to an out of towner as a safe bet. Hits the pho craving you just have to add your own spices/sriracha.

Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!!  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have lots of gluten free options and I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are  <START:O_Pay_Price> priced <END>  well! I go in at least once a week for their  <START:F_FoodItem> broccoli <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> !!  <START:Restaurant> it <END> 's the best I have ever had!! And I alway have great  <START:Service> service <END> !

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  might become my new go to  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  I went in for the first time since the remodel and was extremely  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .  The whole  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  feels wry opened and bright and clean.  With the number of TVs  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have all around the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  this is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to watch football. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great, our  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  knew the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  well and gave us some great recommendations.  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  pretzels to start and I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  cesar melt.   <START:Food> food <END>  came out fast and  <START:Restaurant> it <END>  was delicious. I'll definitely be back here.

I've travel 52 weeks per year. I grew up in Pittsburgh, lived in Chicago for 5 years came back this year.  Been to Italy, New York...Fiori's is the best.   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is great,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  is great,  <START:Service> service <END>  is always friendly and entertaining.  I have been going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for 20 years.

After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and was  <START:O_Experience> completely unimpressed <END> . Even though the shop was nearly empty, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was indifferent and they forgot what I ordered multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  parm  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  I ordered was a hot bland mess. Instead of  <START:F_Ingredients>   crispy   breaded   chicken   <END>  inside, it had plain unseasoned  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  slices which was covered in  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  one step away from  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END> . To top it all off the  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwaved <END> , which made the inside insanely hot and turned to  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to rubber.Maybe their  <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> subs <END>  are better, but the next time I spend $10 on a  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> , it definitely won't be  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .

The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> , perfectly reasonable.  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is convenient, especially if you're catching a flick nearby. The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is about what you'd expect: Not  <START:Food> stellar <END> , but not horrible either. It's on the pricey side, but you probably know that already. It takes  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to keep the engine running.What is really bad is the  <START:Service> service <END> . Well, that's not entirely true. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is actually friendly - very much so, in fact. They  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  you, and  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  you fairly promptly (at the appropriate  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> ), keep your  <START:F_Drinks> beverages <END>  filled, clear  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> , just about everything.But the wait for the  <START:Food> food <END>  is absolutely ridiculous. Not one of those "where is the  <START:Food> food <END> " moments, but about ten of them, back to back, and it's not just when they are busy - even when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is empty, it takes forever to be served. It could be blamed on the freshness of the  <START:Food> food <END> , but we're talking even  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and fairly simple  <START:F_FoodItem> stir fry <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END> , so this isn't rocket science.Or perhaps it is and all those other Chinese places just do it better.

This is where I had the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  of my life. It is hands down one of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  houses in the city, in any city. The  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  is always amazing, which it should be because it will  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  you. That is the only down side but you truely get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for at this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and I believe it is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it everytime.Go and enjoy because you will be speaking about it for days, months, and years... seriously =)

Always good- the  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Size> generous <END>  and flavorful. The veal  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are very  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>  without being heavy. Cappachio chilled ,  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I think this is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to meet friends or bring out of towners. I have been a fan of Chef Nina and her  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  for many many years.

Fantastic  <START:Food> food <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> live music <END> , locally owned. This is our favorite spot to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  for sure.

Well, i think i'm one of a hand full of ladies who actually like  <START:Restaurant> hooters <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .  so my boyfriend took myself and another couple  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for my birthday  <START:Food> dinner <END>  , one of my 4 night stay in vegas (@ treasure island)we also wanted to see  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .. not that  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  anyway..The  <START:Food> food <END>  was okay, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was awful, of all the  <START:Restaurant> hooters <END>  i've been to this is the worst by far. And you'd think its be the BEST since its  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotel <END> / <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> .. not the case.

I've been coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for about five years and today was my last day. I sat down and pulled out my e-cigarette as I have been doing for the past three years. I ordered a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I decided on my usual and placed my order. When the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came back, she said I was not allowed to use my e-cigarette  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END> . As per the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , "E-cigarettes are no longer allowed but cigarettes and cigars are." When I first started coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , I was a smoker! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is great and they have a nice  <START:F_Drinks> draught <END>  selection. I have nothing against smoke or smokers, obviously because this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has tons of smokers who are usuals. I really liked the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  too! The low ceilings combined with the  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  smokers makes for a vintage Vegas  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  that you really can't find much these days.Don't try to apply logic  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . It really makes no sense. I honestly think someone could get away with smoking a joint in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is that much smoke. Make sure you don't bring your electronic cigarette though, you could fill those with  <START:F_Ingredients> cannabis <END> ! The ironic part is that  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a sign out front that says ' <START:A_Plc_SmokingArea> smoker friendly <END> .'If the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  banned cigarettes AND e-cigarettes, that would somewhat make sense, but I STILL wouldn't go back. At least he was being consistent.Do not go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to watch Buckeyes  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  either, they will yell at you for being loud when you are just cheering. I can't speak for Browns  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  on Sunday though. The local Buckeye  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is now PT's Gold on Rainbow anyway and has been for several years now.Pros: Very smokey, like Jazz pool-hall it has that smokey-blue tinge in the right  <START:A_Decor> light <END> .The usuals are all great!The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is fantastic!Cons:No electronic cigarettes.

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  at great  <START:W_Price> prices <END> . I hadnt been  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in years but found it again this past weekend and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is still just as good as ever and the  <START:Food> portions <END>  are just as gigantic as ever. Also one of the few places that still have Stuffed Hot Banana Peppers. If you get the  <START:F_FoodItem>   crab   balls <END> , order them with the honey mustard dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .

The Giant Carumba  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  for $5.95 are you kidding me, this is 3  <START:Food> meals <END>  for me.  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  takes up the entire  <START:S_Cutlery> aluminum tin <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tomatoes <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Even though it is huge still has good  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , I get the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and it is served wet in the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Also comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and has a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  good  <START:F_FoodItem>   salsa     bar   <END> .You order at the counter and they call your number to pick up the  <START:Food> food <END> . If you are looking for a fast  <START:F_FI_Price> inexpensive <END>  good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  clean Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , this is it, They do live up to their motto "Where you don't PESO much!"For the  <START:W_Price> money <END>  you spend and the  <START:Food> food <END>  you get it is a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> , but 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  is an over the top  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for me.Use to go to the one in Glendale, but with work have been coming for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to the one on Bell Road. Same good  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END> 

Premium  <START:Food> food <END>  mixed with daily  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> . Definitely a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to check out.

My absolute favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  Unless you are in a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  group  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is never more then a 10 minute wait, even on Sunday morning when the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  appears to be packed.Friendly  <START:Service> service <END> , and the pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  is to die for.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  have been  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  I was tempted to stop in just to buy a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of the pumpkin  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to go. The  <START:F_FoodItem> omelets <END>  are huge, consider sharing if you aren't a heavy eater. Never had anything other then  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  so not sure how the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is.

The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is awesome...like, seriously awesome. I've tried several of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and haven't had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>  yet.  Also awesome: the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . I find that  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Las Vegas its hard to find good  <START:Service> service <END>  (which is odd because I would have thought the opposite) so I love coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  in because its always a very pleasant  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Ask for Anthony or Don they are both fantastic and friendly  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> . The only reason I gave  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END>  instead of 5 is because their  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining rooms <END>  are extremely crowded when busy and it feels very claustrophobic in those situations. It won't stop me from going back though!

I didn't know  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so many different   <START:F_FoodItem> cheeses <END>  to put on my Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> , he asked me what kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  I wanted I was lost I said "Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> " lol but on the real I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . the corner  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  scares me with so much speeding traffic i always think about a car or truck crashing into people trying to enjoy this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  be safe...

 <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare ordered....well done received. Disappointing for a $50 plus  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  I don't send  <START:Food> food <END>  back to the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , it frightens me. Slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  will be ordered in a bit.

A great steakhouse amongst the excess of options that Vegas provides. We arrived at 7 on a Thursday and had  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> , though the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was not busy enough to require them. I ordered the filet mignon,  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> , and my wife ordered the prime rib, also  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> . Both were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly, and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was extremely high.For sides we had the yukon gold puree, very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> green beans <END> , also very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . They have a great  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  selection, some nice house  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  (I had the Fire and  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  I believe it was called, a fun mix of  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> jalapenos <END> ), and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great.The only downside was the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> / <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . The entrance is directly from the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  floor, which I tend to like the  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  set back more from the crowds, but once we were in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  far back inside, and it was nice and quiet.Overall, a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat for a nice  <START:Food> meal <END>  with amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> . Would definitely go back

I am a prime  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  steakhouse lover! I consider myself an expert in the craft. I have had them all. Flemings, Mortons, Donovans, Ruth Chris ehhh. None compare to Del Friscos! The  <START:Food> portions <END>  are huge and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> ! The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  are second to none! Whenever I stay at the Hard Rock, I make it a point to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ?By far the best  <START:Service> service <END> !

We went to Roy's on the advice of a friend and were  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> ! The Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was "melt-in-your-mouth" amazing and the Mai Tais were yummy!   Hard to believe that this is a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END> !  The  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  was not " <START:F_FI_Taste> vanilla <END> " and  <START:Service> service <END>  was outstanding!

My friend and I stopped  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .  We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  immediately, and the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very nice and prompt with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  refills.  They have a huge range of options for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , and almost everything is made  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , not  <START:F_FI_Quality> boxed <END>  or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END> , which is always a plus.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Apple Compote  <START:F_Ingredients> waffle <END> , and the  <START:F_Ingredients> waffle <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> honey butter <END>  was amazing.  I'd probably go back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  looking, fluffy  <START:F_FoodItem> pankcakes <END>  or some homemade pie.

Nothing out of this world... 1/2 of our 10  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  was pretty burnt and undersized. The other  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  of our order was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  properly and we enjoyed it.However, the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was very unprofessional during our visit and spoke to me and other customers as if he was hanging out with his buddies, rather than  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  customers.

Pancake  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  holds a  <START:O_Experience> special <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in my heart, I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and tried the famous  <START:F_FoodItem> apple pancake <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem>   bacon   pancakes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> pumpkin pancakes <END> , and lately I've been really in love with their  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END> .  They also have  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> thick cut <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> . I'm surprised people don't like the  <START:F_FoodItem> pumpkin pancakes <END>  because my boyfriend is crazy about them and gets them every time. Speaking of my boyfriend, we went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on our first date.  To the Yelp-er who said that this is where people take their one night stands... almost fell off my  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  laughing at that one.  We went back for our 1 year anniversary, we'll be back for number 2.  :)My one caution is that yes, it is as ridiculously crowded as everyone says it is, so be prepared to wait or go on an week day.

Fun spot for  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  and a  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> .  Interesting scene.

I really really don't get the hype over Nobu. Yeah, the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is beautiful, the presentation of the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great, it's always filled with fun people and it's in the Hard Rock  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  (one of my favorite hotels in Vegas)...BUUUUUUUUUUUT the  <START:Food> food <END>  is waaay overrated. I'm Japanese so I think I have a pretty good idea of what good Japanese  <START:Food> food <END>  is. This wasn't it. Sorry.

Still the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  I've been to.  Of course, you have to keep in mind that's it's a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  so for the peeps expecting a 3-Michelin  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , you will be disappointed.  The only complaint I have is that a year later, the Wynn  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is still  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  the same  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  (and  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> !) are still  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> !

I really dont know how people  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>  this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  so high. 1. Its was $50 for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  because of 18% gratuity2. the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  were mostly dry, they had  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  at the carving station and they were dry as can be.  Tell me how can  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  be dry???3. was not  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the selection at all, all their  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  said Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  but who care if it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  bad and plus its American Kobe which isn't real Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> . 4. the  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was okay,  <START:F_Dessert>   ice   cream <END>  was good 5. so overrated for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , just a tourist trap6. better going to a sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> .I felt raped by the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  to  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .never again do a Vegas  <START:Food> buffet <END> , I always used to love  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  when I was younger but the  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  now a days just doesn't justify going to one. Better  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>  at a sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Plus do a free walk around before you decide all  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  let you do this before buying it.

Best  <START:F_FoodItem> barbeque <END>  around, great  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . Could use better  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  makes up for it.

Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to hang out and have a  <START:F_Drinks> drank <END>  on,  <START:A_Ent_Music> karaoke <END> , Dj with  a  <START:A_Entertainment> dance floor <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staffs <END>  are awesome! The sig sig is out of this world

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is absolutely horrible! 1 the  <START:Service> service <END>  is just horrible, our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  practically ignored us all night with our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  empty and we had to ask her multiple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to get refills. 2 we ordered our  <START:Food> food <END>  and it took forever to come out. I mean like 40 min with only 2  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  next to us and others dancing so that has absolutely no excuse for the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  to be taking so long to make our  <START:Food> food <END> . 3 when we try to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  (which was only 38 dollars) I only had a 50 which is relatively close to the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  and our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  said they didnt have change in the drawer, I mean its a 12 dollar change!!! What kind of a restraunt doesnt have 12 dollars change in the  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  drawer?!?!? Well thats my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and it was absolutely fucking horrible. I wish I could put zero stars.

$24.99 for  <START:Food> brunch <END> .    <START:Food> food <END>  was soso, I expect much better from Mandalay Bay...

The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is mediocre.Not bad, but not super good. If you're a foodie, you will have to choose wisely. Not everything in the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is good, but you must pick and choose.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some diamonds  <START:Restaurant> in   there   <END> .My husband and I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on a Friday for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  a few months ago. We had scored BOGO tickets for our  <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:Food> meal <END>  was a GREAT deal! For the two of us (for a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> ), we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $23 total. I would definitely come back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in a heart beat. The value was phenomenal for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . But of course for the next time I'd do the same thing, pick out the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  things (and trust me,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some- including yummy Lox!) out of the sea of mediocre  <START:Food> food <END> .

Was turned onto this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  by a friend. When you walk in, you get this Truck Stop, dirty, dingy type of a feel. This has never scared me because most of the  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , these places have the best  <START:Food> food <END> ! (Check out Polaris  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  behind the Rio All-Suites  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> ! Best  <START:Food> breakfast <END> !)Sat down and everything appears to be a tad old and run down. But, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was pretty decent. You could tell these people aren't corporate, and I don't mind that at all. I ordered the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , wet (with  <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) and  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  with hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and the other  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END> . I like my  <START:Food> food <END>  hot and this was HOT!!! At first I thought I wasn't going to be able to handle, but then I adapted. LIke I said, I like my  <START:Food> food <END>  HOT!!The  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  as if it were prepared by someone who knows Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> , and not by someone trained to  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  and emulate it. My overall  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  was that even thought it aint the prettiest or cleanest  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  more than makes up for it. I say at least give it a shot and judge for yourself. Will I eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again? As Dave Hester would say..."YUUUP!"

The real deal!  Great  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> , true  <START:Food> diner <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Can't ask for more.

Back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again with my monthly ladies'  <START:Food> lunch <END>  group. I ordered the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  combo: 1  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and a  <START:F_Drinks> tropical   ice     tea   <END> . The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  noodle  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  today, it was loaded with  <START:F_Ingredients> goodies <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> onions <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> celery <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and lots of noodles). The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was good, not too salty. I ordered the pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Unfortunately, it is on the extra  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  side. The tip of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was a black and the crust was super  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> . I did not attempt to eat the crust, way too hard. It was better last time. The  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and nonstop flowing of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  was good. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is always excellent.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ! The people are usually nice & helpful.  We live near Nellis AFB so this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  isn't close to us but we come on this side of town just for the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> !  Wish they would open up a shop over close to us!  That would be awesome! (Hint, hint) ;)

Omfg diablo  <START:Food> hot   wing   <END>  challenge is not a joke, they use  <START:F_Ingredients> ghost chilli extract <END> , warning do not do challenge my tongue, throat, cheek and ears went numb and no I did not finish the 20  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  only ate 15  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  ....

Winner winner Tuna melt sammich. They use albacore white, Swiss  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on a  <START:F_Ingredients> soft heated bun <END> .  It was Earlicius!!! Sorry no pics, scarfed that bad boy down.  It was also a really good  <START:Food> portion <END> , not gijimbo just right.

Sure, Vegas has some of the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in the world. So when you want something fast,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> , and easy, shouldn't it still be at the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  you expect? That's what I found at Earl of  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . Not just a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , but a low  <START:W_Price> price <END>  hot  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  gourmet grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> . I had the chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END> , and it was far more than I expected. It was not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  I've ever had in my life, but it was absolutely  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> , quick, and  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  for about $6. If you don't want to blow a ton of  <START:W_Price> money <END>  on a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat and you'd rather spend it in the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END> , then grab a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  from the Earl.

This was easily one of the best  <START:Food> meals <END>  I have ever had, the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was awesome. Just an all around great dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . GET THE  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  FOR  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> !!!

Consistently excellent!  Had  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  last night and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was superior,  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent as well.  We come to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> marketplace <END>  often and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is always beautifully presented and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is consistent.  Well done, we will continue to come back!

I visited this little jewel when it first opened and bought six  <START:Food> pastries <END>  to take to a friends  <START:Food> luncheon <END> . I was really disappointed and never went back. Three years later, looking for a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  near my home, I stumbled upon Scratch again, this time to rave reviews. I decided to give it another chance and get actual  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and I am so glad that I did! I chose the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict with ham (I will try the  <START:F_FoodItem> smoked duck <END>  next time). This is the first  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Phoenix/Scottsdale to get hollandaise right (they make their own), the poached  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  were perfection. Now, I normally get really irritated at a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>  side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  on a plate of great  <START:Food> food <END>  as an afterthought. At first, I ignored it and dove into the actual  <START:Food> food <END>  that I ordered. I decided to use it as a  <START:F_FoodItem> palate cleanser <END>  but then I couldn't stop eating it! No "afterthought" sides for Scratch!  My husband said the hash browns were the best ever and I agree. They are  <START:Offers> seasoned <END>  with maybe  <START:F_Ingredients> fennel <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END> ?  I was full so I had to get my  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  to go. The  <START:F_Dessert> salted caramel <END>  is just like butta!!  I would love to keep this little  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to myself but it wouldn't be fair to the rest of humanity.

Everyone at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  (4  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> ) all had different  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> entres <END> . Needless to say, all of us raved about our  <START:Food> meals <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  we had, I believe his name was Matt was fantastic with his  <START:Service> recommendations <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> . If I stay at Palms again, I would return for sure.

I go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  frequently because it's only a couple miles from my work and much better than the nearby Souper  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . I usually order a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  caesar or salmon  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is flavorless and  <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  extra, but without it I'd probably still feel hungry after. I noticed that when I first started going earlier this year they filled the bowl to the top with  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> , but now it seems like they only fill it  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  way. I like that you tell them what  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  you want instead of your typical  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  where you always wonder who touched or sneezed on the  <START:Food> food <END> . They chop your  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  which is very nice. The  <START:A_Decor> dressings <END>  are good, but unless you like a ton of dressing make sure you tell them you only want a little because they put a lot on. They also have a punch card and punch it 2  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  if you get a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  (only  <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  $1 more), or 1 time if you get a  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Overall it's an OK  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .

Unless you REALLY have to have a  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , I suggest you go to the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .It's not like the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  aren't good.  They're ok, I suppose.  The choices are limited and so are the ' <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> '.   <START:Service> service <END>  is ok but could be improved.  My husband liked it a lot more than I did 'coz we came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  TWICE but it's just a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  to me.  Nothing out of the ordinary nor gourmet about it.  I miss  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !!

Great vegetarian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is great and diverse, and is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  very close to McGill. I really enjoyed eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ; however it is very popular and is often crowded. On the plus side, you can make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> .

The  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  was similar to what I have experienced at many other steakhouses.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is way  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is marginal.  We went for the 45 dry aged Porterhouse  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and it arrived  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  very well but lacking in seasoning and all of the character you come to expect and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for in a dry aged  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  The sides were very average as well.  The one good thing was the  <START:Service> service <END> .  We had a big group and they handled everything well.  Definitely not the best choice in Montreal.

I went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and will never go back again. I thought the combinations on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  were kind of bizarre- having some  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  on the side- but maybe that's just me, too much carbs and  <START:F_Ingredients> starch <END>  on one plate is kind of off-putting. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  had some choices that sounded good, but that's it. I ordered a 'make your own  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> ', which had penne, mixed  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> , and rose  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . When my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  arrived, it was not what I was expecting. Way too much  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , and not enough  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END> -  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were maybe 2 florets each of  <START:F_Ingredients> broccoli <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cauliflower <END> , and maybe 3 pieces each of red and  <START:F_Ingredients> green peppers <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  didn't even seem  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was doused in  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and was not very pleasant to eat.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was so much  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , it could have been split between 2-3 people. I noticed all the  <START:Food> food <END>  going out looked like it could have fed that many people. Why make that much  <START:Food> food <END>  for one person? i don't understand. Takeout the rest after maybe, but I certainly didn't want to.The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was just as bad- I ordered a mousse, which was much too rich, and again  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was too much of it.Despite the gross  <START:Food> food <END> , I think the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was friendly to me, addressing me in English as I was the only anglophone at the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . I'd give the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  1.5 stars because of the  <START:Service> service <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  is memorable, but for all the wrong reasons.

Nothing like  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  a Metro.  Typical Scottsdale in trying really hard to impress with a look and not being able to  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> . Big  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in the middle seemed like the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to sit.  Weird  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  outlined the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with tacky  <START:A_Decor> curtains <END> .  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was ok but didn't seem to offer any real interesting or creative touches.  Calamari and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  were decent but were a little pricey especially for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .  Nothing really appealing to draw me back to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

Awesome  <START:Food> food <END> . Never had a disappointing  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  item. Seitan  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are as good or better than the real thing! Great take-out spot.

I'm under the impression that Ohana Hawaiian BBQ is a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  in Las Vegas, but you definitely get a completely different  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at each  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .The Husband ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Katsu and Kalbi  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>  Combo, while I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Lau Lau  Their two  <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and one scoop of  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is an embarrassment to Hawaiian  <START:Food> food <END> .  When I opened my box, I thought they were kidding.  What's up with the  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END> ?  Definitely disappointing on that part alone.The  <START:F_FoodItem> short ribs <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  okay, but my  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was super dry.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were minimal fatty pieces, and everyone knows a good lau lau should have some decent amount of fatty pieces!  <START:Service> service <END>  can be improved  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The only girl working was outside  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> socializing <END>  with some  <START:S_Staff> guys <END> .  I needed more  <START:S_Cutlery> napkins <END>  and since they are behind the counter, I had to go outside to request more.  It seemed like I was bothering her.  Overall,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are way better Hawaiian  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Vegas that do better in  <START:Food> food <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> quantity <END> ) and  <START:Service> service <END> .2.5 stars

We stopped in during the festival (make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> !). The  <START:Food> food <END>  was very carefully prepared, and quite nice.  I see one reviewer was concerned that this is a  <START:Restaurant> tapas <END>  establishment (that would be the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  next door). No, this has credible Spanish  <START:Food> food <END> , and a reasonable  <START:S_Menu>   wine   list <END> . A fun evening.

Does Edinburgh really need three branches of I.J. Mellis? If you've sampled the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  they sell, you'll know the answer is YES. Established in 1993, this  <START:A_OutsideView> picturesque <END>  shop is the original I.J. and is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  halfway down the charming Victoria Street in the Old Town. It's tiny compared to delis like Clark's and Valvona & Crolla but they manage to pack a lot of character and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavour <END>  into the  <START:A_Places> space <END> . On a weekend it's usually crammed with tourists ooohing and aaahing at the produce but in the week, its easy to walk in and pick up supplies for a last minute picnic.On those rare occasions, my basket usually includes a campagne  <START:F_Ingredients> loaf <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> rustica olives <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> grilled artichokes <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> parma ham <END> , Montgomery Cheddar, Ragstone goats  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and some Mrs Kirkham Lancashire.

Tried this after the reviews on Yelp.  Had a bit of a Wait on a Saturday morning, but we expect that.  They told us 10-15 minutes, but it actually was more like 25 minutes.  While we were  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  we saw someone slip the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  $20 to skip the line - not cool !  Once  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  (inside as we took first available) our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  came over very quickly and took our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  order and then our full order - we got our  <START:Food> food <END>  very quickly considering how busy it was.  The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very friendly and gave us suggestions on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  since this was our first time  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I had the Caprese omelet, which was excellent - my partner had the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry <END>  pancakes and said they were good too.  It was a little noisy inside, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was excellent and we will be back.

One of my favorite  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  cafés to visit! This morning our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  DONNA was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and polite. She immediately noticed  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:F_Ingredients> creamer <END>  left on our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and was quick to bring more for my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,she also brought me a new  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  right away. It's not easy to find great  <START:Service> service <END>  in a busy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,but I am very pleased with everything  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  including the  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchilada <END>  omelet is a fantastic choice! The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is amazing & they bring you your own pot to pour from instead of having to wait and hope that you'll get a refill. Next time you're hungry for a hearty  <START:Food> meal <END> ,this is the spot!

AMAZING!  My husband and i have been "take out" from  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the past year.  Always SO relish- and zero mistakes on our order. Always order the Pho  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> - w  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and an order of  spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> .  We decided to stray this week and try recomended Pho Lein which had great reviews.  SUCH a disapointment. When we got home, unwrapped the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  to put into the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  - it was already pre  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> ? UGH. The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was fatty and tasteless. Pho Bac- great  <START:Food> portion <END>  sizes,  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , and delish! Be prepared w/  <START:W_Price> cash <END>  only and time to look for  <START:S_Parking> parking <END> 

This was my first time eating Vietnamese  <START:Food> food <END>  and I wasn't disappointed at all.  My husband ordered an iced  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and I quickly followed suit.  When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  I am used to very strong  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  so when I go out, it's hard to find  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  that I like but this one was simply amazing.  I decided to try the Pho with  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  and my husband ordered the Pho with  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and tripe.  I loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>  leaves that they give you to add to your  <START:Food> meal <END>  and thought the  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  was pretty good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  weren't that great.  If you decide to order the Pho, I would recommend that you try it with something other than the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END> .  My husband enjoyed his bowl of Pho as well.  We will definitely be going back  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  sometime soon!

 <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .  Beware can be quite spicy.

Old fashioned  <START:F_FoodItem> hamburger <END> , tortilla  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  walnut  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , wonderful. Give it a try and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was only 2.50.

It can be lonely being a  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  enthusiast in Waterloo. For six years I've had to endure a city with a makeshift  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  culture. To make matters worse, my Coop terms take me to Seattle and New York to enjoy the best  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  culture around only to yank me back to KW every 4 months.Today I'm enjoying an Americano on King Street in Uptown Waterloo. Any other day I would be at Heuther's or my oh-so-favorite Second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END> . Not today. On the corner of Dupont & King  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  infusion of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  culture into mundane Uptown life.This new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  is appropriately called  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  Culture and I have the best  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  in the house! It's the  <START:A_Furniture> red   leather   <END>   <START:A_Furniture> couch <END>  in the corner by the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END> . I can see the little old ladies in the street plastering their faces into the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  wondering what this new  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is. After walking away they are back literally 10 minutes later with their husbands to try it out.  The lineup was short but the wait time was long. The  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END>  was new so I forgive him. I took in the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  instead. Oddly it's spread out the whole length of the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  making it hard to read everything while standing in line. After ordering and taking my super awesome  <START:A_Furniture> seat <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> barista <END>  came by. She asked me exactly how much  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  I'd like in my Americano. It might not seem like  <START:O_Experience> special <END>  treatment but it is. The last time I had this custom a  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  made for me it was at bauhaus in trendy hipster Seattle.The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are low  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  to fair  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I have a feeling they will rise to match everyone.  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  shops are always  <START:W_Price> more expensive <END>  to run than initially thought as well. Still, they are definitely competitive with Starbucks, Second  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END> , Heuther  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and even Timmies. They have plenty of  <START:Food> food <END> . If I had  <START:W_Price> money <END>  to spare I'd try it out. Though, the smell of it is enough to convince me to come back!The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is sparkling clean. Sure to please my parents when they come for a visit. They never did like the grungy hipster makeshift house  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> 's I generally drag them to. The  <START:A_Furniture> couches <END>  are  <START:A_Furniture> leather <END>  and the  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END>  and  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  real wood - not plasticy Timmies style - though you knew that by now. They even have a nice big screen  <START:A_Ent_Tv> television <END>  so I can enjoy a  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  while getting some work done - free  <START:S_Wifi> wifi <END>  hurrah!Oh look, even a cop walked in to try it out. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is destined for greatness :p So long Timmies and good riddance.One new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  may not be enough to turn KW into a thriving cosmopolitan city overnight. But with a new  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , I feel better that  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  enthusiasts in KW aren't a dying species like first thought.

How can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ? I've been telling myself I'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that I keep losing. Since this shop is in the same complex as a  Gold's Gym - that's a good enough excuse to indulge in sweet  <START:Service> treats <END> , right?The shop is so cute. Black and white  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  and the  <START:A_Decor> colors <END>  come from the beautiful  <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END> ,  <START:Food> pastries <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . They serve  <START:F_Drinks> hot chocolate <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> ...and  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  (at night).  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  +  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> ? Can I just live  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ? Before I continue, I must say that my love for  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> . These French cookies are my faves just like chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate chip cookies <END> . I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  in ALL their  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> . So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> . My true test for  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  is pistachio  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can  <START:O_Experience> special <END>  order items a day before.They have 10 macaron  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  at a time. I think 2 are seasonal  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> :  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Snickerdoodle,  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> , Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's  <START:F_FoodItem> blueberry pancake <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END> , maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , Snickers Candy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chocolate-covered   strawberry   <END> . I got 14  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  - I had to get an extra fig and goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  macaron and 2 extra Nutella  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> . I also got a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_Dessert> fruit   pavlova   <END>  and a green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . As for the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's how each ranks:5/5:  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry4/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  bar3/5:  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END> , grandpa's  <START:F_FoodItem> blueberry pancake <END> , birthday cakeGreen  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> :I love green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  and not a lot of places have green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END> . The crust is crunchy. The  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  is deliciously creamy with a good green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . It's topped with a  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sesame nougatine <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem> raspberry <END> . Amazing! 5/5Fresh  <START:F_Dessert> fruit   pavlova   <END> :A  <START:F_Dessert> pavlova <END>  is a meringue topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> fruits <END> . It's  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> . It's like a "healthier"  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  if you will. 5/5They warned me that the  <START:F_FoodItem> birthday cake <END>  was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . Hooray for honesty! The  <START:F_FI_Taste> fig & goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since I love goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Sweet fig + tart goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  &  <START:F_Drinks> champagne <END>  sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were mild but really sweet. I think the  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple- <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  macaron. Score! The  <START:Service> service <END>  is amazing  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  an average of $7 apiece and the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  are $3.50-4.50 each - the  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END>  are HUUUUGE though (the  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of your palm or about 4  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> ) and the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  are of  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> . Hello? I don't mind  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for something good. You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in. And if you buy more than 6  <START:F_Ingredients> macarons <END> , you get 50cents off each additional you buy.I was smiling the whole time I was in the shop like a kid in candy store. My friend who was driving me around even said, "see! It's that smile that makes driving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it".

So I had to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  cause I was starving and visiting my mother in the hospital. I gotta admit what I had was not  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  bad for a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  joint. I had their Spicy Chipotle  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . It had some kick to it and the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  was enjoyable.

I've been coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for years just because I live across the street. The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is horrible and the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  are definitely high! I wish  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  closer cause I do like the  <START:Food> food <END> . My rating is based only on  <START:Service> service <END> .

Excellent hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> food <END> .  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END> . Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and they were excellent.

Used to go to this subway all the time. But stopped going after I got extremely sick. They're  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  always gave off the vibe that they hate their job and this one  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  moves soo slow. Expect to wait a  <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  hour if he's making your  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END> . And he also gave me a huge thick slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  (it was the end) and I was just disgusted so I decided to stop going their.

Good  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  when you're up to on the deck. Not sure about the inside as I didn't venture inside. Good  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and an extensive  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Had the wasabi tuna  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , and what led me to order based on the description lacked in  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . The " <START:F_FoodItem> green wasabi <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is very bland.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are s many other good things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  that I will be sure to return...I'll just pass on the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .

At least it has  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . The $13  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  was about an inch below the rim of my  <START:F_Drinks> martini <END>  glass. I had to have that corrected immediately before the night started off wrong. The whole  <START:Food> dinner <END>  could be ruined but that  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  will not be. The  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  were orgasmic. Not happy that they charge $5 for a ramekin of horseradish cream  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Had a  <START:S_Gift> gift card <END>  that could take care of the whole  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the idiot couldn't process it. He made it sound like it was my problem. It was issued by your  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , not sure why it was my issue. He actually asked it I wanted to use the  <START:S_Gift> gift card <END>  or  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  by other means. I just about lost it. I still have nightmares about the stupidity of that statement since  <START:S_Gift> gift cards <END>  are just as good as  <START:W_Price> cash <END> . If you work in the industry you'll get 25% off on Mondays after 9 p.m.

To begin, I am not the biggest fan of thai  <START:Food> food <END>  to begin with, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was great.  We went with another couple and seemed to order everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> , but they got a  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  that was great, the  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>  was excellent too.  I would make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  if going for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  as it was super packed and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is relatively  <START:F_FI_Size> small <END> .

Its okay, I was not really sold on the whole idea that their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is similar to that of the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  from back east.  And I also don't know why they insist on giving  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END>  with every order.

After giving it another chance, my wife and I went back. Instead of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  2 hours for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , we selectively chose to wait for a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Furniture> seat <END> . After 20 minutes we got one and this time the  <START:Food> food <END>  was great, not just good.

Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with good  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  is good and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> .  If you enjoy  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go.  We had  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cakes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END> , and of course some really good  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> .  I enjoyed everything about it.  I'll be back.

If you like  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> ...you'll like Seasons 52.   After my wife and I dined on the  <START:F_FoodItem> flatbread <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> trout <END> , we were convinced that in order to add  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  to their reduced calories, they poor on the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> .I read a few reviews  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  that mentioned bland  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Possibly the management read the same reviews and asked their  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  to open the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  shakers?   It really spoiled what could have been a nice  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .And skip the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> .   Very over  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  for what amounts to a plate of mixed greens and little else.  IMO, True Foods does a much better job.On the pro side, the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is very nicely designed with a pleasant  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  and good  <START:A_Decor> lighting <END> .  And the wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and polite.

First time for me at DiVerti  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  & Grill. Clearly a great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  being on the corner of University & Mill.  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is in the back next to Jack In The Box. Pretty average  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  inside. Very typical of what you would find of a campus  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . Carpets been removed and they stained the exposed cement floor. 7+ HDTV's above the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  so good for catching a  <START:A_Entertainment> sporting <END>  event. We ordered Hot  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  to start and they were good. A few undersized  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  made it onto the plate, but no complaints. Entree:  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  w/  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  + jalapeno. It's a specialty  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  of theirs and it wasn't bad. Different, but good.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were extremely reasonable and they had a deep  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  of items to choose from.  <START:Service> service <END>  was good. Granted  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were only about 10 people in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , but Bartender was friendly and made some  <START:Service> recommendations <END> . Full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and lots of brews on tap. I'll be back to check out  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> !

excellent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> , chat with a friend, or work.

I work downtown and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is awesome!  I've ordered both  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  - both fantastic.  They do all of their own  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  grinding and seasoning of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and it's  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  The  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  area is really tight and cramped but they just opened an upstairs too.  The  <START:Food> lunch <END>  time crowd is crazy busy, but overall excellent!  If you work downtown, definitely try it out (order take out).

The  <START:Food> food <END>  was surprisingly  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END>  was impeccable.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a little high for what you get but all in all a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  we will be back for sure.

We go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  about once a week for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very friendly and efficient.  They take the time to get to know the customers and know when to look for a refill.  Good, not great, selection of tap  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  - all good and interesting but not extensive. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent - predominately gastro-pub.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> slider trio <END>  is great and the margherita  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is one of the best in town.  We also enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> carne asado & queso <END>  dip.

We were torn between Butters and Butterfields (based on yelp reviews). Very pleased with our choice to go to Butters Pancakes &  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> '! Everything looked so good that we ended up ordering 3  <START:Food> entrees <END> . The salmon/cream  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  scramble,  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  rojo and  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  French toast (AMAZING!!!). Everything was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and well  <START:W_Price> priced <END> . Also really enjoyed the  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> !

Outstanding  <START:Service> service <END> , very clean. Ordered the French Onion  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Eater (roast  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  on french with au jous)Both were  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and hot. Will be going back :)

Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  bunch to get a good  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are not bad either.

 <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> flavored <END>  well.   We had good  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>   <START:S_Staff> manager <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  could have been warmer.

We were in Vegas a few days ago and wanted to try out Gordon Ramsay  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  so we called  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and found out they were booked until after 10pm.  No problem as she told us we could go to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  if we wanted to as it has a full  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  We ended up going to  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at American  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and decided to have a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  at Ramsay.  When we got to the host stand we were told that the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was bought out for the night by a party.  This would have been great information to give us when we called earlier that day don't you think?! We were pissed but not as pissed as if we had decided to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  We got over it and went to Max Brenner for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  which was great.  I don't know if this was the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing but it left a really bad  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  in our mouths.  Maybe we'll try it the next time we go...but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many other  <START:Food> stellar <END>  choices in Vegas.

I'm a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  snob......and I enjoyed this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was EXCELLENT!  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Ryan, was knowledgable with a great sense of humor.  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and big  <START:Food> portions <END> . They didn't skimp on the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  in our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Garlic edamame was very strong so make sure your date eats it too. We ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> albacore crunch roll <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> poke tuna <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  spicy tuna  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> lotus roll <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem>   shrimp   tempura roll <END> . Love the  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> jalapeño <END>  to top!  Everything was eaten with no complaints at all!

 <START:Service> service <END>  was a bit slow but the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  way more then made up for it.   <START:Food> dinner <END>  was okay. I'm sure I'll be back for football season.

I work downtown; been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  two or three  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  BBQ - Their's is good.  Good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , several  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  available, and the  <START:Food> portions <END>  (at least on the Plate) are fine (not heaping, but fine). I've had the Brunswick  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END> .  Okay, so simply based upon my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and input from friends, Brunswick  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  is usually thick and not soupy.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  is soupy  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  - i.e. it has a lot of  <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END> .  But, get this now... I've ordered it twice because it's good.  So it may not look like what you're expecting when you get it, but give it a try.Collard greens were good.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  seems to be a lot of  <START:F_Ingredients> stems <END> , but then, not everybody  makes the effort to pull some out.  Good  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> !All in all, this is a convenient spot for good BBQ in the center of downtown Charlotte.  Fortunately for us  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in the queen city, we now have two options available!!If you do go, get the deviled  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  They are good!One thing to note... if you order a soft  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , you're buying a bottle.  That's it.  So your refills are limited to your bottle.  Want more? Buy another.  I don't care for this approach.The wait  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very nice, friendly and informative.  Not terribly  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , but then they don't have to do refills either. ;-)So, I like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and will most likely be back.

During the course of  exploring the Strip District of the city I was looking forward to having a pub-style  <START:Food> lunch <END>  somewhere in the area. Unfortunately, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I was hoping to visit was  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  on Sunday (should have checked the listing on yelp!). I walked into Kelly O's (which must be 180 degrees from a pub setting) to find a bustling  <START:Food> diner <END>  filled with guests of all ages and descriptions. My  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Andrea, approached the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with 45 seconds and took my order. While tempted to have something from the Sunday extended  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , I opted for a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  Pot Pie  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and "Classic" patty melt. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  arrived quickly and hot (and I mean HOT!) and included a nice  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of crust and chunk of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was also good (hot), rye  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END> , good  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  melt and  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to the temperature.In spite of the business levels and somewhat cramped quarters  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no level of chaos at Kello O's. Instead,  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  moved about smoothly while  <START:S_Delivery> delivering <END>  orders and every departing guest was warmly thanked for their visit. The  <START:F_Drinks> patron <END>  mix ranged from children to folks well into their 80's. And,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an obvious mix of " <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END> " and first timers like me. Andrea was conversational, refilled my beverage without request and provided me with much appreciated information about the District. By the way, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,including  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END> , was remarkably clean which is saying plenty when considering the number of people that obviously went through the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . It's nice to visit a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that doesn't try to be "something they're not." The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is straightforward and genuine, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is "as promised," the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and connected with their customers.  I'll likely visit again with friends and family.

Tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back.Not bad, but for their high  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are better choices in LV.Noise level is high.

What I Learned From My Bacchanal  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>                                                               by Lori R    1)  If you want the SUPER Bacchanal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  you must go after 3pm!  A lot of what I've heard described in reviews was NOT on the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  that we went to on a Tuesday at  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END> .    That being said, we also  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> half <END>  of what others  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  at night.  We arrived around 10:45 a.m., so it was around $50 for both of us (before tip).   2)  TIP!  Add gratuity to that  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  when you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  it at the register.  They will MARK your receipt as a  <START:O_Payment> tipper <END> .  Don't know if that gives you extra credit or what, but they sure make note of it.  And if that's not reason enough, these  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  work hard keeping your  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  refilled and whisking away endless empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> .  They also take  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  and  <START:S_Cutlery> pepper shakers <END>  very seriously, as I heard a serious conversation that involved keeping track of whose were whose. (you have to ask for it, if you want them, by the way, they aren't on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ).  3) PACE YOURSELF.  They were changing over from  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  when we arrived, so they kept putting out new things.  Favorites for me were some Asian items...the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> green beans <END> ,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> .  Also thought the sliders were excellent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion rings <END>  very good.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an awesome  <START:F_Ingredients> truffled <END>  potato gratin, a  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  tater tot casserole...a very flavorful  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  habanero  <START:F_Ingredients> sausage <END>  (although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was nothing habanero hot about it).  From the Italian section, not a lot was calling out to me, but I did have a  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>  which was good, although very big...a smaller one would have been even better.    Seafood was disappointing to me, as expectations were high based on the reviews I had read, but those were obviously for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  I asked if it was too early for  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  legs, and was told yes, not until after 3.  Steamed  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  were good though.   4)  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  selection must be different this early in the day, also.  VERY GOOD though, but sadly, no macaroons!  I tried a  <START:F_Dessert> passion fruit meringue tart <END>  and a  <START:Food> chocolate creme brulee <END> .  Both were pretty good.   So, to sum up my personal Bacchanal  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , it was quite good, but being  <START:Food> lunch <END> -time  <START:Food> buffet <END>  eaters,  we have preferred our  <START:Food> lunch <END> -time experiences at both  Wynn and Wicked Spoon.

I was super excited to find a soul  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Las Vegas, just moving  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  from Atlanta, and being a huge soul  <START:Food> food <END>  fan! I did my research on yelp and decided to give Soul  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  a try! We were greeted by a very nice  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  and  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  right away on a Sunday, so far so good! I ordered the Catfish  <START:Food> lunch <END> , comes with two sides and cornbread (cornbread is sooo yummy, prob the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> ) I really wanted Collard Greens, my fav, but they were out so I ordered Cabbage and yams. My husband ordered  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and gravy and Cabbage. We tried to order the ribs for our daughter off the kids  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but they were out of ribs too :( So we ordered baked  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  for her.  After a pretty long wait we were told very apologetically that they were out of Cabbage also. At this point I did want to leave, or wish I would have known about them being out of  <START:Food> food <END>  so early on a Sunday, I would have liked the option to try again another day...BUT after  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  about 1.5 hrs we stayed, and  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  said that she would comp two sides for us. We finally got our  <START:Food> food <END> , honestly the  <START:Food> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was quite laughable (maybe Ive been spoiled down south?) On the plus, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  but for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> / <START:Food> portion <END>  ratio and the wait I dont know  if I'll be going back? btw..we ordered the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  Momma : Sweet  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> / Lemonade and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  Daddy : Kool Aid and Lemonade..Really Good, but VERY sweet... <START:F_Drinks> drank <END>  all my  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END>  for the month ;) lol

A bowl of potentialOn blistering cold nights, sometimes all it takes is a hot bowl of  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  to purge the chills & rejuvenate the senses. On a quiet little part of what appears to be dead-man's alley, sits this cozy little shoppe; a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  of hope in the sea of darkness.Upon entry a fog of authenticity & warmth envelopes you, as the hosts so graciously  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END> , get you situated & promptly serve you. Observant, keen & interested; a cohesive team that works together as they shuffle around caring for Tender, juicy, flavorful, the karaage hits every corner of your palate in a vibrant explosion of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  & feelings, as it slowly melts in your mouth. Generously portioned & accompanied with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Should  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ever be shortage of  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in the world, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> broth <END>  would most definitely be my new vice. It oozes of authenticity, with an array of tantalizing  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> ; from the succulent  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , to the wafer  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  seaweed the fukumimi ramen is a testament to the establishment's commitment to excellence.Praises aside,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are definitely two major issues that almost made me drop a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> . Please do lay off the  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> . I almost felt my tongue fall off after my 4th karaage. Also please cut back on the seaweed in the fukumimi ramen, that almost ruined the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  as I was winding down  <START:Food> dinner <END>  (it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like seaweed  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  instead of ramen).Overall, I applaud the  <START:Service> service <END> , I shall plan a return in the near future.

Very good  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  and  <START:Food> food <END>  always pretty good. Love the  baby bella mushroom  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  with sriracha  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END> . Sometimes  <START:Service> service <END>  slow but not a bad  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> .

The  <START:Food> food <END>  is fabulous (I love the Gecko Burro and Pollo Fundido...and the  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END>  and cream--one word-- AMAZING), the  <START:Service> service <END>  and  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  are awesome and their involvement in the community is so great! I love supporting a great business like this!

Came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> brunch <END> / <START:Food> lunch <END>  this Sunday; I wasn't overly hungry, but luckily everything was made a la carte, and  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  fairly! I shared the  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  balls with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was sweet and savory with leafy  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> cilantro <END> . I often find anything with  <START:F_FoodItem> chorizo <END>  to be too salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  pairing. They have the healthy option to get  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  wraps instead of  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> flour tortillas <END> , and seeing as  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was an abundant amount of free  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , I didn't miss having a tortilla-the  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  was perfect! The free  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  also came with three smaller and unique  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END> / <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  that varied in  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and spiciness-it was awesome to have variety. To top of the great  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> , the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  was amazing. I loved the  <START:A_Decor> high ceilings <END>  and  <START:A_Decor> stained glass <END> , a  <START:A_Decor> huge rustic chandelier <END>  and beautiful well kept  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END> . I will definitely be back!

Cute  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in an odd  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . Very accommodating even though it was the last day for my Groupon. Very friendly and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> -especially the nice young man filling the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> !  I agree their  <START:F_Drinks> wines <END>  were not the highlight but they have other, name brand choices at reasonable  <START:W_Price> prices <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  was very good. Mixed bruschetta board looked odd because  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  didn't appear to be  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toasted <END>  but the varieties were good-very  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> generous <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END> . Had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:O_Experience> special <END> -carbonara. You could tell that was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  and due to the richness, I thought the  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was just right. Ate every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . Good find from Groupon!

Really good  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> hamburgers <END>  are outstanding.  Prime Rib sliders were really good but could've used a little more jus for dipping.   Best for last:  The Cheddar Ale  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is totally bonkers!  I've never had anything like it.   <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , helpful with the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection, and pretty quick.   The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a sports- <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  with a zillion TV's and a rambunctious crowd, but nothing I'd be afraid to bring the children to.

Excellent  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . Great  <START:W_Price> price <END> . Excellent  <START:Service> service <END> . Nice  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  Humari  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  if you are downtown! They literally pulled me in off the street and I have been going back ever since!

VEGETARIAN options in every  <START:Food> food <END>  category! Awesome  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END> - (3-6 am and pm) where else can you get a glass of Stella for $3!!?!? Football  <START:Offers> specials <END>  during every NFL  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> ! Phenomenal  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> - super nice and friendly! Open 24 hours! And  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  served 24/7! My new favorite hangout! Great gaming incentives!  You must go!!!

Dickey's saved my Thanksgiving!My brother & I decided to do Thanksgiving w/ friends super last minute. Hash House a Go Go ran out of  <START:F_FoodItem> turkeys <END> . WTF. So did Mimi's  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END> , Lucilles, and Famous Daves. Double WTF. I needed Thanksgiving to-go and only 2 days to do it! Dickey's had 2  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  options for $49.99--Cajun  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  or Smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END> . Of course, they were sold out of the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  but they had 1 smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  left. I called dibs!!!The pick-up process was easy. Zipped in and out within 5 minutes. They're  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  on Thanksgiving so pick-up needs to be the day before. They're open late so I picked up around 7pm. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  is wrapped in  <START:S_Delivery> foil <END>  and comes in an oven-safe aluminum pan ready-to-heat. It takes about 2 hours for the  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  to reach eating temperature. Excellent  <START:S_Delivery> packaging <END>  since my friend just moved to Vegas and has minimal bake/cookware available. I needed low maintenance  <START:Food> food <END>  and Dickey's definitely made the holidays a bit easier for me. The  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  itself was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I was a little concerned that the smoked  <START:F_FoodItem> turkey <END>  wouldn't have the Thanksgiving  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  I was looking for but it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . Not the best I've ever had but very good. As much as I love cooking and being able to put all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  I want into things. It was a relief to not have to deal with cooking a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  bird and focus on the epic  <START:A_Entertainment> games <END>  of Settlers of Catan and Wii Tennis.

Just stopped in for my first Firehouse  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  and I wasn't disappointed. I had the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on white  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Healthy> fresh <END> , a little  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> , and very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The pastrami itself was cut thick and also had a great  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . They have a hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  loaded with great, hard-to-find, hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> . The only complaint I have is that it does take a little while to get your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , about 10-15 min. Now this certainly didn't ruin the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  for me and to be fair, they were getting slammed with orders. Overall, it is very easy to recommend this  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  shop. I'll certainly be coming back...next time for a Smokehouse  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  & Cheddar  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END> !

I don't usually write reviews but today I decided this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  one :)    I just got the 12  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  for the family and I have to say, it was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ! <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END> , not greasy at all, coleslaw was awesome. Kids loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> mac <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> biscuits <END>  ( I don't eat them ) but they said it was great. Also got an order of he butterfly  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  which was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  Definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  going back for!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is great! To be honest I first thought it had a fast  <START:Food> food <END>  concept and was a little sketchy but it's not at all. Not sure what I ordered, all I know is that it was one of  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Offers> specials <END>  and it had  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in it. Great new  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Definitely coming back!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is ok, had the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  taco, need a little more  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  . Can yall please add hooks under the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  for us chicks please

Another Uptown location that understands foot traffic. (I mention that because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are some that never seem to have enough workers. I guess trying to  <START:Offers> save <END>  a  <START:W_Price> penny <END> .)   <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's always a  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> rush   line   <END>  and this visit no exception. However, I was able to get in and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  in less than 15 min. Plus you  <START:Food> food <END>  is ready as you go along.Tasty options, and  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining room <END>   <START:A_Places> space <END> . I would go again.

A  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of Charlotte history.The BBQ is good, maybe not the best.I kinda compare the local que to Kyle Flethcers in Gastonia.This is alright but not quite Kyle style.The days of the drive-in or waning.Go here for the experience before it's gone.

*Sigh*  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  makes me happy! Did you know?! It TOTALLY does! Me and the queens made plans to have  <START:Food> dinner <END>  somewhere - you know... like normal civilized people. All we knew was that I wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and that we wanted something awesome! After looking around on Yelp I chose to take the queens to CBNC... "So where is this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ?""ummm... between 7th street &amp; 10th street off of Camel""Okaaay? The left or right side of the road?""I unno""What do you MEAN you don't know? Haven't you been here before?!""Ummm... no.""oh HELL to the no!"*the car then becomes filled with laughter*We passed right by it and then flipped a bitch out of no where and it made us fear for our lives! and then screams filled the car. Soon we were parked infront of a soon to be Domino's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and headed to the  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  of my lil yelp dreams... Only to be met with a 20 minute  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . We were then  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and I was left to fight off the queens who seriously considered going to Tokyo express instead! And then FINALLY our names were called and we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was very nice. I want to say that it's the little touches that make CBNC great. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>    <START:F_FI_Quality> thick <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lemon <END>  wedge and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  sprig of  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>  in the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  pitchers. The way the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are so  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . She even complimented on my Japanese pronunciation! :) I didn't want to tell her the origin of my great accent...  watching Kill Bill a thousand  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> . She helped us  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . I wanted nigiri and they didn't have it. I was disappointed but still went with her suggested  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and alaskan   rolls  . They were AMAZING! I loved the crunch and the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . With the soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was scrumptious. We wanted to cancel our  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  and just get more  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> ! The alaskan was great as well. I loved it. Even the queen who never had  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  before liked it. After devouring the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  our  <START:Food> food <END>  came. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  soba noodle  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END> . It came with  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  instead. (boo!) but the  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  was perfect! (yay!) and I never had soba  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , I usually get udon or chinese  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . but I really liked the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> spniach <END>  that was wilting more and more as  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  went on. The slight  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the sliced green  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  really made the  <START:Food> dish <END>  something special. I loved it. I am just so sad that I couldn't finish it all! :(One queen devoured the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  yakisoba  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  at once! I was able to sneak my  <START:S_Cutlery> chopsticks <END>  inbetween his  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  and I got a  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . it was CRAZY  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END> ! each of the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  had a great difinitive  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and yet melded together amazingly. I loved it. The other queen was pleasantly surprised at the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of his  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  plate. He couldn't finish his eaither but it was really. A lil too  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  for my  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END> , but it was still awesome. We then  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a bottle of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and a sip here and a sip  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and we were all in heaven! Talking to our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  about the Navajo  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  behind the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  who she was trying to hook up with one of us... but we couldn't tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with! One of the queens or me?! Said  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  never made it to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  - and it's just as well... we were in  <START:Food> food <END>  heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in! I'm a big fan of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now and am VOWING to take several people with me next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ! :)

We live by MOTO so we are kinda stuck when it comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  establishments. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  blows. You can tell it isn't  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  and never  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  super. The Mojo &  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  are the only good things. I don't really trust a  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that hides the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  makers in the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> ...stuff probably looks like week  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  shit which it is.

I originally walked in here and thought to myself man I bet this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  people in the morning..I can see the shamu wearing  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  ladies gathered here in the morning drinking their  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and gabbing like little chatting Cathy dolls about the new pool boy, and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  dudes talking about their tours in Nam and the Korea and the few survivors from the big one  WW II. To say the least I did not see that but I did  <START:A_Decor> picture <END>  it in my mind...suffice to say it was not like that but that was my first vision:)What's good about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is it has plenty of  <START:A_Places> space <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  seems very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and it is  <START:F_FI_Quality> clean <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are delicious with pretty  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Places> portions <END> . Not huge or anything but decent. I did think it was a little pricey considering I could get a bigger better  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  at subway for about $3.00  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in not bad. Run of the mill a little pricey. But would not be opposed to going here again.

A friend of a friend was telling us about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  on Sunday morning, and how awesome their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is.  It sounded awesome, but he warned us the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  is usually an hour and a half long.  Oh well, we went anyway.  Luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  long for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  When we were leaving, though, the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  was easily an hour long.We started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , which come in an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of 14 and were delicious.  Five of us were dining  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , so we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two small  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> , with each one being a half, so we had a nice  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  to try from.  We got the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , the Frisco, Grandma G's, and one more that eludes me now.  All were pretty delicious, and I give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  with untraditional toppings (Grandma G's had potato on it).  Our entire bill with a few  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  came to under $80.Oh, make sure you sit  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> ... the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  and annoy the hell out of our party.  The women in our party also said the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  temperature kept changing in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , so if you're going  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck.

This is about as close to an authentic Japanese izakaya as you'll find anywhere. And I'm talking countrywide.  I've been to several izakaya in Japan over the years and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  just brings me back  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  immediately.   My japanese buddy in San Francisco is jealous of this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to give you a little perspective on my claim.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is incredible and you'll find yourself hard pressed to try everything they have to offer as new items come and go all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  I recommend damn near everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  If something scares you,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  IT, and you'll be pleasently surprised everytime.  If you do try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , make sure you get a members card, as you will definately be returning.  For every 5$ you spend you get a stamp.  The initial card saves you 5%, fill it up and you  <START:Offers> save <END>  10%, fill up a second card and you  <START:Offers> save <END>  15%.  This is permanent by the way, you can use it for every visit.  SO GO  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  ALREADY, and I'll most likely see you  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  as I am  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  4-5  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  a week.

Oh sweet baby Jesus, I love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Retro  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  who does a Robert DeNiro impression, and amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> . About mid way through my (rare) petite filet the other  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> -I turned to my husband and said, "I want to give this  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  a baby" Because that's how good it is.  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's always a point where I start to get sad that my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  will be gone shortly, so I try to slow down. But it's too hard at the Golden Steer! I don't want to slow down! Nomnomnom.Forget the stupid fancy places in the hotels on the strip, the Golden Steer is the real deal.Go. Now.

I'm no Korean/Hawaiian  <START:Food> food <END>  expert, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has lived up to the hype.  Thanks Jade for the recommendation.  Myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .First off, the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>  is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> .  Not this  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> .  You'll get this as an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , so even if you are not a  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>  person you have to try it.  Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  (the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , being the  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END>  fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The  <START:Food> crust <END>  was kind of  <START:F_FI_Quality> thick <END> , but not greasy at all.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was delicious, great  <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>  and herb  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> .  A good sign of things to come...I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> , super  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> really nice <END>  Kochujang(?)  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavored <END> .  What set this  <START:Food> dish <END>  apart for me was the high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of  <START:F_FoodItem> kimchi <END> , I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean  <START:Food> dish <END> !I also managed to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  my friend's  <START:F_FoodItem> bulgolgi <END> .  I normally don't like  <START:F_FoodItem> bulgolgi <END>  because it is always tough and overly  <START:F_Ingredients> sauced <END> .  Not this  <START:F_FoodItem> bulgolgi <END> , which is the best I have ever had.  VERY  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , and expertly seasoned.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  and of a homemade  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  Just delicious!Again, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean  <START:Food> food <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean  <START:Food> food <END> , this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go when you do.  If you are a Korean  <START:Food> food <END>  snob, give Island Style a try and let me know what you think!

So sad! This used to be one of my fave places. Over the last 10 years I've barely ever make my trip  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  anymore because I am steadily disappointed in the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  if  <START:Food> food <END> !  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is spoiled or scarce, spring  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  filling probably a week  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> .. So sad because they literally have the best pad thai and  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>  on a good  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> . Today I was craving  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  thread noodle so I thought I would given them a chance again.., once again skimped on  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  and yellow (how can you not make  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  everyday?) , and they seem to think  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  means throwing in a shit load of crushed red  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  which adds no  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  or  <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>  just stomache irritation,. I'm so sad to say, after over 10 years this my last straw. Sad because  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's so much potential if they took the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .

Easily the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Madison.

Let me start by saying this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is REALLY hard to find! Even with my trusty GPS I found myself walking in circles and calling, calling,calling. I've seen many complaints about  <START:Service> service <END>  on here, and while my  <START:Service> service <END>  was not BAD in terms of inattentiveness, it certainly wasn't normal. The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  both came over several  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  while we were eating and at one point I just wanted to say, "Um, can we eat? Please? It's great...I assure you. Skidaddle."We had the Wildberry Pancakes with a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> . Everything was good but for what we got, I consider the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  steep. $12.50 for 2 pancakes?? Yes, they were good, but why not 3 with a little more topping? My $4 side of  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  was 3  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  and maybe 1/4 cup of  <START:F_FoodItem> apples <END> . Lame. It's good but I'm not sure if I would return, at least on a  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  when I was really hungry.

I've gone here twice in the 3 days since I moved to Tempe and am extremely grateful to have found this gem (thanks Yelp!).  I eat between 5-10  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  a week and have no doubt that I will be getting several of those from Dilly's.The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , I was a bit put off by the thickness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ;  I did not want the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to overwhelm or disguise the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> /cheeses/ <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  (foccacia) was actually quite soft and complemented the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  (the Smokey Mountain) quite well.  Nonetheless, I would warn that if you really are opposed to eating a relatively  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  amount of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , you might prefer something else, or perhaps one of the wraps offered here (though I haven't tried any of those yet).Also, it'd be nice if  <START:F_FI_Healthy> nutritional <END>  information were made available on the website.  One of the hibernate reasons that 80% of my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  consumption has been at Subway/Cosi/Potbelly is that I know the  <START:F_FI_Healthy> nutritional <END>  content of what I'm eating.  I hope to come here as many  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  as possible before the ASU onslaught begins in a few weeks...I hope the lines aren't out the door when classes start...although I suppose I will just eat  <START:Food> lunch <END>  at 2 if that's the case.

With all that hype about this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , I was excited about going  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . But hmm it was just... how can I put it? Meh! Didn't do it for me. I would rather go to Daphne's.

When it comes to  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:Food> lunches <END>  on the westside of town, nothing beats Thai BBQ on Jones. Many a  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  have coworkers and I stopped in for a great  <START:Food> meal <END>  on the  <START:W_Price> cheap <END> . Have tried it a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>   <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  of  <START:Food> lunch <END>  which just means the  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are a little  <START:F_FI_Size> larger <END>  and  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  higher but still great Thai  <START:Food> food <END> . Oh... and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is awesome! The only thing I have against this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is their  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  weird to me, but things like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  or  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  in my sprite are all good. Odd.... Maybe it is just me.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was horrible! I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  200 dollars for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  for two, my  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was still mooing! If you are in Vegas and want a real  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse does it right!

Thank you Yolinda for always making me and my guest  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  to your  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .It's always nice to come to this fabulous  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for business meeting with my clients. The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  is always excellent, and of course, my guest was amazed by the selection of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  you always have to offer.Keep up the good work and always keep the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END> !!

 <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END> !  We stumbled upon this after attending an event in Vegas and just needed to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat.  I usually am so picky about  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  that I won't go to just any  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but we needed to eat.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was very good.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  were tasty.  So much so we bought a bottle of the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dressing <END>  to take home with us.

Okay, so this was a total hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END> , but GREAT carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . I would  perhaps have given them  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5 stars <END>  if the 3  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  had actually first included the gacmole they were suppose to and the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was melted. But the carne asada was very good, almost San Diego-like.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  put the  <START:Food> food <END>  together in a heart beat but it was 10:30pm.  I have to say, this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is in the memory banks...so close to the airport and the strip (if you have a car).  Just do this,  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a carne asada  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  and ask for extra gac and if you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  do the 5 with the works.  Glad I found this on Yelp and for sure  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END> ..oh and this is take-out only, no  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  really and not a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you want to hang.

Normally love Baja, but this one has been very disappointing.  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  like rubber. All but one  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  eating.  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  are a no go, and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was average. My suggestion, don't let this be your first experience a Baja  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , go to another location, they do have good  <START:Food> food <END> !

I have eaten at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  twice. The first  <START:Food> meal <END>  was memorable and I never forgot it. As a result, I was so excited to go back last week. I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  for an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . My friend had a  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  that was the favorite of the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> 's but we both found it very strange. It was supposed to be something creole and the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was covered with an unattractive brown  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . Odd.We both had a filet mignon. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mine  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare. I couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. Disgusting. It was fine but not  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  $50. It came with a   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that made it delicious though. Without the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  it would have been a big disappointment.We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a side of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> double baked <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> . That was the best part of the  <START:Food> meal <END> .We each  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . I had the  <START:F_Ingredients> banana <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  pie. It was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which I LOVE) but with little  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> . It was fine. My friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious. <START:Service> service <END>  was very nice. Overall at $312 I won't be going back simply because it isn't  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  the money.

Best  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  in the Venetian! I am in Vegas for a conference. After realizing the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  at Lavo would take at least an hour (per the bouncer) despite the fact that our group had rented out the  <START:A_Places> space <END> , I checked Yelp and found the VIP  <START:S_Staff> managers <END>  (Jorge) personal number. After a few extremely helpful texts assuring us no cover, a bunch of us headed over  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , tweeting that we were going and for the rest of our group to follow. Michelle at the door was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> really nice <END>  and let us right in. All toll about 50 of us ended up  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and had a great  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> ! The  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are extremely reasonable for this casino ($8 for a rum and  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> , $8 for  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , etc) and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is hookah for a respectable $25. The DJ was great and had us all dancing. I was blown away by how much the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  went out of their way for our group and truly saved our  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> !

Not much to say about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ... the  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is hip and the  <START:Service> service <END>  is good but unfortunately, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is pedestrian and while  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a lot of fancy Mexican  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  verbage on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , it's still pretty straight forward typical Americanized-Mexican fare.   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> burritos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> , tamales, combo  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END>  etc.  I can get this kind of  <START:Food> food <END>  in my suburban home town that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better and  <START:W_Price> cost. <END>  a lot less.  Even the highly-rated  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> -side  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  was just ok ...  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's just too much stuff in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Could all of this be smoothed over by a nice  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END> ?  Well, I will never know because mine was too sweet.  Overall, a disappointment.

I've been to the House of Blues for a few concerts now, and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are plenty of other venues that offer a better sound  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , especially in Las Vegas. If you have the opportunity to see a band at another venue, I  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  it. The sound  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is awful, so  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  will be a very low chance you'll understand anything coming out of the singers mouth. It ends up being just a muffle that fades into the rest of the band.

The  <START:Ambience> ambience <END>  is great and just shy of being too hip. Waitstaff was super  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> --felt like I was eating at a friend's house, but guess that's the point.Limoncello and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were great. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  suggested we get the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  one over  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> . You should try it.Didn't try the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We'll be back.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has definitely improved. I remember the early days of soggy crusts,  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , subpar  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  and heartburn.  This is certainly no longer the case.The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was super jammed around 6pm on a Thursday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> .  It was actually kind of exciting!  All the  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  in back were having a good ol'  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and the gals up front taking the  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  were visibly stressed, but doing a great job.  We ended up creating our own  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  We kept it simple, and just added  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> .  It's everyone's new favorite... in fact, I've been  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  the same combination at other  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  places, but it's not nearly as  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  as Mamma Mia's version.  They have a great selection to build your own, however I'm sure that all their offerings are a hit as evidenced by the long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  of hungry  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  lovers going out the door.

I've been to  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  at other casinos, but this is the best by far! Lots of  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:Food> seafood <END> , great carving stations, however I was not a fan of the way the prime rib was seasoned, and great  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> !

At first I was disappointed with Padre's  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  I usually get  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> , and they only had soft  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> .  But then I ventured out and got this amazing  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  that came with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  Really glad I tried it.I was also pleased to see that they had Sol  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  It is my favorite Mexican cerveza, and I usually can't find it in  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .

Great  <START:Food> food <END> ! Best  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  I've ever had. Get the nachos, you won't be disappointed! 10x better than Roberto's!

Awesome  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> ! Their microbrewed  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  are a mere $2 a pint from 3-6pm Monday through Friday (excluding holidays and Monday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  Football.) They also have $2 well  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  as well as a great selection of  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  for $4.50. I had an IPA and a Santa Klaas Holiday Ale which was specially brewed for the holiday season. This was a very dark ale that is made with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cocoa <END>  nibs. It was a delicious and different  <START:F_FI_Taste> bittersweet <END>  ale with  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  overtones. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and fantastic!We were only  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  this trip but will definitely return for more awesome  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  and to try some of the  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Food> food <END> !

Think New Jersey  <START:Food> diner <END>  size  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , lots and lots of  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  covering most major  <START:Food> food <END>  groupings.  I had an LTO special called drunken  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  which had a pleasant  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and was served over potato cakes.   Very generous  <START:F_FI_Size> in size <END>  and I enjoyed it.  We also tried the rib's which turned out to be very decent considering it is a chain  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with a broad  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was very good and the store had a good sized  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>  eating area.  Would certainly go again if in the area.

You know how sometimes a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has such an impact on you that you start writing a review in your head as soon as you put something in your mouth? That happened and zero stars should be a thing.I decided to give this  <START:Food> buffet <END>  a chance since a client had booked rooms for my coworker and I at Excalibur, and after getting up 6am for the flight and working until 7pm that  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> , we were both exhausted and didn't want to go very far for  <START:Food> food <END> . Big mistake. No matter how tired or hungry you think you are, you are NOT desperate enough to eat here. I would have preferred walking back to LA.The selection was awful, all the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was dry, the  <START:Food> seafood <END>  looked sketchy enough that I was too scared of potential  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END>  to try anything, and a lot of items at the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  were browning. All I ended up eating was a couple  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  of potato gratin, and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Yes, this is  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  (only $22) but it's not even  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  that. I wish I'd just gone hungry.

Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is next to  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  N juicy. Not big, but not too crowded at  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is very simple just  <START:S_Menu> one page <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  soon  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END> , my friend had dolsot bibimbap special. Both of us enjoyed our  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  inside is also  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  is very fast too.

We went at around 5:30 on a  Tuesday  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was fairly busy.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  drop  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was delicious, and the highlight of the  <START:Food> meal <END> .  The only other two  <START:Food> dishes <END>  that were  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  enough were the Walnut  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> steamed <END>  clams.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a lot of high value items at the  <START:Food> buffet <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> crab legs <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and the like, but most of it was  <START:F_FI_Quality> dried out <END>  and not as tasty as it looked.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a wide selection ans some interesting  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> , like clams smothered in cheddar  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  I guess this is Arizona, and I should not have been surprised that next to the sweet and sour  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a tub of  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was also obligatory Chinese  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  I don't eat any of these picky eater accommodation  <START:Food> foods <END> , so cannot comment on their  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . They had a wide  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END> , too, including a  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  i had the green  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and it was okay,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a couple of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  crystals in it. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was  <START:W_Price> more expensive <END>  than I thought it would be.  I think the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  range should be adjusted to Moderate $$. I did not try the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  preparing it as we watched and it looked good.

Awesome  <START:Food> food <END> ,  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are a lot better than most places,  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are good too... well definitely be stopping in when in that area...  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> 

I've been here twice now for the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  and the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I even brought a friend who was a foodie and both  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  it was great. They have a great selection of dips on the  <START:Food> buffet <END> , a few  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and many  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END>  to choose from. I recommend taking a little bit of everything and if you follow my rule, you won't be disappointed. Everything is absolutely delicious and you'll have fun guessing the spices in the various  <START:Food> dishes <END> . If you're in the mood for some tasty middle eastern  <START:Food> food <END> , I would really recommend it. It's a little short on  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> , but with  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  like that, who's looking anywhere but their plate?

Went to Flo's  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END> , we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  and sour  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , which was very sour & not  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  at all; crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> , which was ok, one of the highlights of the  <START:Food> meal <END> ;  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  chow mein, which was tasteless;  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was ok, nothing special; and moo shu  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , which wasn't good. The majority of the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was tasteless.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were 5 of us in total, and we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $50 plus tip.

Gag  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> facilities <END> ; Sketchy business practices!  This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  deserves 0 stars. I was in Las Vegas on a business trip and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a slice of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  It was dripping with so much  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END>  that even 5 napkins would not sop it up. I returned the entire slice  <START:F_FI_Quality> uneaten <END>  and requested my money back. The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  at the register refused and told me to come back at  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and ask for Pete.  I returned later and the  <START:S_Staff> female <END>  " <START:S_Staff> manager <END> " told me Pete wasn't  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and they don't give refunds.  After ignoring me for 10 minutes she realized I wasn't going away so she called Pete on the phone. He said he would have to mail me a check  for the purchase  <START:W_Price> price <END>  of the slice. Uh, the slice was $3 and, as you probably guessed, I never received the check. In addition to the gross  <START:Food> food <END> , I made the mistake of entering the  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END>  and the stench of urine and fllth almost knocked me unconscious! Avoid this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  under all circumstances!!

Excellent  <START:Food> food <END> ! I was here for a  <START:Food> lunch <END>  meeting and was  <START:Service> treated <END>  but I believe for the 3 of us the bill came out to $40 if you're trying to estimate cost. Note we were here on a Monday and they close at 4:00  <START:S_OpenHours> pm <END>  on Monday's.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was ample  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  inside, but I can see it hard to grab a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  during the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  rush. They have your standard mexican  <START:Food> dishes <END> . I was craving some  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  so I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Al Pastor Taco combo with  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> . I was hardly able to finish but it was too good to leave left overs. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> yummy <END>  too. Interestingly enough they were lacking  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  options and brought out a small condiment cup of Tapatio when I asked for some. Everyone else seemed to tear up their  <START:Food> food <END>  as well and seemed satisfied. Reason for the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 4 stars <END>  then? It's not the best mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  I've had, so I have to  <START:Offers> save <END>  the  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 5 stars <END>  for my favorite places, but for a lot of people this is a 5 star  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is awesome! I never have been a fan of chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , other than Panda Express, but this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great. I'd recommend the sweet n sour  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  :) And the best part is, they  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> !

I noticed a bunch of Pho places on Spring during my trip to Vegas this past weekend.Having partied hardy the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  before, our group decided Pho was definitely in  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .Maybe I'm spoiled a bit because I've had the best Pho in San Jose and Westminster... and so my Pho standards are pretty high.I felt it was an okay  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  at first glance:  <START:F_FI_Quality> clean <END> , lots of Vietnamese locals, and spacious.The pho was really average. The  <START:Food> broth <END>  lacked body and substance, and could have possibly been adulterated with some Swanson's  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:Food> broth <END> . I hate that. The  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  were okay, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was TOTALLY skimpy in the  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  in Pho Dac Biet, I got no such  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in my bowl and no tripe either =(I also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  some Vietnamese  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  ( <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Sua Da) and it wasn't strong enough. They skimped on the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  grounds. I like places that prepare the french press in front of you instead of going to the back and giving you pre-stirred  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , but they shafted me on the strength. It  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_Drinks> watered <END>  down.I'd probably never come back unless it were like the AM and I was desperately wasted.The  <START:Service> service <END>  kind of sucked too. We were all hungover and needed  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . We had to ask 100x  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  for refills!This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  kind of reminds of the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and even appearance of Lee's Noodle House in San Jose off of Tully Rd.... If you're from San Jose, you know what I'm talking about - this is Lee's Noodle House twin brother in Vegas.

Second  <START:Food> buffet <END>  stop in my 5  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  stay.The highlight of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  had to be the fire alarm that rang out in the middle of our  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Heh, dunno what happened  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .All that aside, the  <START:Food> food <END>  itself was below average to average. Probably the only thing I liked was the Har Gow. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was loathful; leaving it out in the open for what seemed like for hours (the colours look way off). I didn't bother touching it, as who knows what kind of  <START:F_FI_Healthy> bacteria <END>  has grown in those things...

One of my favorite Tempe spots, Forefathers really instilled in me a love for the Philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . When visiting, I always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the 2nd  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>  option with white American  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , and either a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> french   fries   <END>  or their equally excellent  <START:F_Appetizer> sweet   potato   fries <END>  . For those wanting to manage their  <START:A_Places> portions <END> , their  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  also come in smaller sizes. After placing your  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , be sure to go to the small  <START:A_Furniture> refrigerator <END>  across from the  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END>  machine and get a side of their sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  to accompany your  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has great  <START:Food> food <END> , and along with it a comfortable, casual dining  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . It also has  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  ownership and  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . It's been a while since I lived in Phoenix, but whenever I return and come to Forefathers,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are people working here who remember me and  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  me back. If you check out Forefathers, I am sure you'll want to come back again.

Interesting reading other reviews complaining about the  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>   <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  too. It is the hibernate reason I will never put my foot in Cafepino again, apart from the fact that it is  <START:W_Price> overpriced <END> . I much prefer to go to AMC  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>  Ridge and have  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  half  <START:W_Price> price <END>  during  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  at the Yard House, where the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  is  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END>  and cares about his customers.Eight of us went to movies and had  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at Cafepino last month. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was okay but I had to cancel  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  because it took so long to arrive and our movie was starting in a few minutes. We were  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  long before the movie started to have enough  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to eat. When we wanted to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  separately because everyone didn't have cash, the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  scoffed at us and basically said he couldn't accommodate us, only one person had to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END> . We were all shocked at how  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> rude <END>  he was and decided to move our once-a-month movie  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  to a different location. Good job in loosing eight customers in one fell swoop. Bon chance!

Ever since I came here the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went to Vegas, I've been DYING to come back.The  <START:Food> food <END>  is so good!  I thought we just got lucky the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  thus far is DELICIOUS. <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is classy and cool.  It's a nice location within the Palazzo hotel with lots of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> .   <START:Service> service <END>  was also good, as my  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  glass was always full despite being very  <START:S_Del_Time> busy. <END> on a Friday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  at midnight.We got:MOQUECA MISTA -  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> squid <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> roasted cashew <END> , dende oil, chimichurri  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  - $29 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uA#T4JWaoBHrbkBP4vR92x4uAThis thing is the BEST EVER.   <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  Thai-style  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  (hence  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_Drinks> milk <END> ) with the delicate  <START:Food> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the  <START:Food> dish <END>  great  <START:Food> texture <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was served within the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  mixture as shown; the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> soaked <END>  up all the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , making every  <START:F_FoodItem> morsel <END>  DIVINE.  I thought after a while the  <START:Food> dish <END>  would get too rich-tasting, but somehow I kept gobbling and gobbling until the  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END> was empty!EL TOPO  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  - salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf,  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  melted mozzerella,  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the moqueca mista)Very unique   roll   with interesting  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and textures = Delicious! <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  TERIYAKI - Samba Style organic  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , aji amarillo, purple potato mash,  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  - $26 (again forgot to take a pic...)When I saw the huge   price   tag I thought "WTF?!", especially for a seemingly simple  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END> as  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  teriyaki (my friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  this one so I had no control).  BUTTT I'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  I've ever had in my life!  Super juicy fillets of teriyaki  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , pan  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  (I think) to a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> .  The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the  <START:Food> dish <END> .As with all finer dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , especially on the Las Vegas Strip, I did think the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a little inflated.  Hence the lack of that final star.  However, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in Vegas.  I'll definitely hit it up again on future trips.  They have a good  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  too (both early  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END>  and late  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> ), so I'll have to take advantage of that next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ! :)

Just tried Create  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END>  on a date with the hubby.  Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to build your own  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  sundaes!  Too many  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  for me, so I opted for the pre-designed option:  The Abstract  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END> ) made Renaisance-style (provolone,  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , terriyaki  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) on a Hawaiian  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> sweet   potato   fries <END>  .  Yum!  Next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'd like to try the Portobello  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ...and opt for a wheat  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  and maybe get a little more  <START:Food> creative <END>  with toppings, but the combinations are endless...The options for the  <START:F_Dessert> custard <END>  is just as abundant!  Candy, nuts,  <START:F_FoodItem> berries <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> ...and of course the pre-set combos.  I tried the Berriesoho  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END>  in a  <START:F_Dessert> cone <END>  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END> , blueberries, blackberries, whipped  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> , and  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>   <START:F_Dessert> custard <END> .  I think it was the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  someone asked for a  <START:F_FoodItem> sundae <END>  in a  <START:F_Dessert> cone <END> , but it worked.  The only problem was that it was melting faster than I could eat it, but still very yum!Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for ppl who like  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  and want to be  <START:Food> creative <END> .  The people who work  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:A_Places> kept   clean   <END> .  It's a little too pricey for me to be a " <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END> "  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat, but I will definitely go back again.

I cannot explain how much I love the  <START:Food> food <END>  here, especially the Fungi  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . to.die.for. They have a great  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  from 3-6 and all  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  Sunday, which I appreciate.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is hit and miss.  If only they could be more consistent with the  <START:Service> service <END> , this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  would knock it out of the  <START:A_Places> park <END> .

Very slow and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> unresponsive <END>   <START:Service> service <END> , at one point the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  didn't stop by for 20 minutes.   The  <START:Food> food <END>  took over 45 minutes and was cold when it was served.  $300  <START:Food> meal <END>  for 4 people, better to spend your money elsewhere.  Only good point was the key  <START:F_FoodItem> lime pie <END> .

My partner and I went to Eddie's House prior to her  <START:A_Decor> art <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  opening at a nearby gallery.  We planned on Eddie's as a start to a very special  <START:S_OpenHours> evening <END> .  We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  and it took our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  7 minutes to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us and ask us if we would like  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  another 10 minutes for them to arrive.  When he brought them he made no mention of the long  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  to share and then a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  platter to share as our  <START:Food> hibernate course <END> .  He brought everything out at once which was not what we asked for.  We ate our  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and asked for the bill upon completion as we were leaving to get to the  <START:A_Decor> art <END>   <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> .  We  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> ...and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> .  I went inside to try to find him with no luck.  20 minutes later he brought the bill out.   The  <START:Food> food <END>  was average and over  <START:W_Price> priced <END> .  We were charged for a small  <START:Food> dish <END>  of extra pita  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  to supplement the original small serving that arrived with the hummus.  All in all it was a disappointing experience due primarily to the dismissive behavior by our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> .  I called Eddie's House the next  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  to share my feedback and got Eddie on the phone.   I started telling him about my experience and he he  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> acted <END>  like I was interrupting him.    He asked if he could call me right back and confirmed my phone number with me.  He never called back.  I will never return to Eddie's House after this poor example of customer  <START:Service> service <END> .   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are too many other  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Scottsdale to dine in who  <START:Service> treat <END>  customers like they are  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  the effort to be courteous.

Went with  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and thought  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  a bit like  <START:Restaurant> cafeteria <END>   <START:Food> food <END> . Overall, my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  loved it. I was just not too "Krazy" about it.

To be hnonest, I have only eaten here a few  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END> , but I ALWAYS use them for  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> catering <END> . Today was no different. Perfect in every way. Thank you Mitch( <START:S_Staff> owner <END> ) for all of your hard work.  Great  <START:Service> service <END> , thank you!

What a great  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  find! I live just around the corner and was so exited to find a new  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go out to eat! The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has a great  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  with an  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  Chevy Right in the center. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  could not be any more  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  either! When it comes to the  <START:Food> food <END> , you can't go wrong! The  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is to die for, and I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to come for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> berry <END>  granola pancakes. I give it an A++!

the quick and dirty - on a great placeAtmosphere:  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Vasco Da Gama (henceforth referred to as CVDG) has been around for a while.  A  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  that serves  <START:Food> food <END> , it's offend crowded with couples and  <START:S_Del_Time> busy. <END> working professionals - its a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to see and be seen and ironically one can even hide away here! (go to the back!) <START:Food> food <END> : Tunal  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ?! Yes please - a specialty of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , CVDG surges paninis,  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> ,  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  that are both temptingly good and filling.  Never had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>  here. <START:Service> service <END> : since the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  can be quite crowded, be prepared to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  a little bit to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .   <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  are made in person at the counter, and  <START:Food> food <END>  is delivered to you once its ready.  Minimal  <START:Service> service <END> , but always pleasant and courteous.Pop in for a bit during the work  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  but my favourite  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to visit is during the early hours of Sat / Sun - people are a lot more relaxed and  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's a general sense of easy about the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  as people are inclined to be a lot more mellow.  Summer  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  even bring a few  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  for some open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  render-vousYou should go :)

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is horrible, I wouldn't feed this to my dog. It is however tasty and greasy if you haven't a  palate.

This is such a cozy  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! I had no idea it was right around the corner for me. 4 weeks into going Vegan and I was starting to feel like my only option at any  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  or  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  was  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END>  topped with  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . Not so at Sunrise  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> ! I'm finding lots of other places offer items as well, but  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  need to be asked for.The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was delicious, and just as beautiful to boot! The  <START:Food> food <END>  was great. I had the Alien  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> , and my boyfriend had the nomnom  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> . Both made vegan. No complaints from either of us!  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are fair. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is adorable and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> ! Support local, and keep this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  alive!!

Mmmm I love Buffalo Grill!! If ever I am feeling in a serious need for some  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , this is always my first and last port of call as it always does the trick. Situated just around the corner from the hibernate University campus, George Square, Buffalo Grill is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for students to go for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  or  <START:Food> dinner <END> . I completely and utterly adore Buffalo Grill's  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  always ask you how well you want your  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , as it always comes out exactly how you have asked it to be done. I tend to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  their Diablo  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , which comes with sour  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and jalapenos  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  so it is pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  but amazing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  come in two different sizes, and I always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the smaller version as that fills me up and  <START:W_Price> cost. <END>  about £5 and the bigger size  <START:W_Price> cost. <END>  about £7. The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  come with  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and, my favourite,  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END> ! Buffalo Grill also serves a huge  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of different Scottish  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  which  <START:W_Price> cost. <END> no more than £10 - what a bargain! But the Buffalo Grill is not just a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  eaters, as they have a hibernate  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  which offers a good selection of  <START:F_FI_Religious> vegetarian <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  too such as  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> 's and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict. A  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  are also available including  <START:F_FoodItem> crepes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pecan <END>  pie which is amazing. Buffalo Grill also allow you to bring your own booze which is a much  <START:F_FI_Price> cheaper <END>  option than buying  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . I completely adore this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and cannot recommend it more highly - GO!!

Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  in the UK has been grievously disappointing, both in  <START:W_Price> price <END>  and representation.  Gone are the days when $4 can score me a half-pounder cabaza/lengua  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .Tex Mex was the last I expected this far up north.  Scotland rocks.Let's do this bullet-point style:Margaritas - decent tequila content and thoroughly slushed.  Nothing more annoying that semi-icy concoctions that don't travel up straws well.Much respect for carrying Dos Equis, Corona, Sol, Modelo and that obscure little label Pacifico.Tequila - they carry the good stuff; these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  have done their homework.  Gun for the Anejos.  Don Julio Gold Anejo was my pick.Floutas - more like giant taquitos, the corn tostada-wrapped  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is deep  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  to crunchy perfection.  Topped off with  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , sour  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and guac it's what I'd expect to see in higher-end Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in LA or San Diego.Carnitas - the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was served in cubes and was much too salty, unfortunately. <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  - covered in a healthy layer of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  to be called such, it's an accurate enough representation of what my Mexican friends' moms would make at home. Approved.

I really wish that I lived closer to one of the Crackers  <START:A_LocatedArea> locations <END> , because their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  rocks! After a field trip to IKEA with my mom and sister we decided to grab a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat, I knew that Crackers had recently opened nearby, so we stopped by. The inside is very cute, feels like you are in someones country home. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has a huge  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> . On weekends, they serve  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  all  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END> ! I got the Carnitas  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  skillet, and let me just say, they seriously have some of the best carnitas in town, no joke! The  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was so  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> ; covered with jack  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on a bed of  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END> , heaven! My sister got the BLT, and they were not skimpy on the  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> ! I have had some of their  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  before, and let's just say, the  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  & Artichoke is like heaven in a bowl! So rich, and  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END> , it is like eating dip without the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> ! They are only open until 2:00, but it is great spot to grab a  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to eat for  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  or  <START:Food> lunch <END> !

One of the better  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  places on this side of town, good selection, nice  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , not too busy

I do enjoy the  <START:Food> food <END>  here . Finding good island  <START:Food> food <END>  like how you would get in Hawaii is state find in Las Vegas. My favorites are the Kalbi,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and the weekly specials. My wife insists we come every Tuesday for the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> . All  <START:Food> dishes <END>  are ample  <START:A_Places> portions <END> . Most like you will have  <START:Food> leftovers <END>  for the  <START:A_Furniture> fridge <END>  tomorrow. The Chantilly vale is to for. The live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the selected weekend is a  <START:Service> treat <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  here is always on point. Keep up the great work it's like you on an island in the middle of the  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> .

Eh, but better airport  <START:Food> food <END>  then usual

If I HAD to eat one  <START:Food> buffet <END>  every  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  this would be the one I would pick..The long lines are a minus,but that shows others  [mostly locals] also feel as I do.

 <START:Service> service <END>  was slow and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was horrible!!!! With 4 exclamation points. We went through the drive-thru and the handwritten sign says pull forward to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , so we did. The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  didn't come to the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>  for 7 minutes. Then he asks us to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  another couple of minutes to take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . At that point we should have left. But I was curious as to see what the rave was all about on the Travel Channel. When we finally get our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  taken. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a Pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . Not only was the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  long the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to get our  <START:Food> food <END>  was even longer. Total  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  25 minutes, no I'm not joking.As any fast  <START:Food> food <END>  eating American would do we pulled out the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and took a few out while we were driving away. Yes they were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  as expected. But they were so salty and hardly any  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . We were expecting minced  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  and to our surprise it was only  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  salt with more salt - YUCK.The pastrami was very thinly sliced but was very fatty. Not typical of "LA Style Pastrami" as advertised. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was hard and not  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . Could it get any worse - YES, the pickle was not put in a separate wrapper as I asked, so the pickle  <START:F_Drinks> juice <END>  made the inside  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  soggy. I do not like  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  on my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> . The portion of pastrami was very skimpy. IMO - This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is not  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>  of any publicity on national TV. It is expensive and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is CRAP. If you are in Los Angeles got to the Hat, you will not be disappointed!

If you go to Happys , you become part of the Happy's  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> ! Great  <START:S_Menu> variety <END> , simple good  <START:Food> food <END>  with generous  <START:A_Places> portions <END> ! We love Leo, Donna and the entire crew. Try it you will love it!

Pros: Great  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , especially for AYCE!!  Whoever posted that their  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , are completely Wrong!  In comparison to other AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  places, they have  <START:F_FI_Size> very little <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> .  Great big  <START:A_Places> portions <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , etc.  Maybe at one point they did mostly  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , but not since Nov 2011.  Nice  <START:S_Staff> servers <END> .  <START:Food> lunch <END>  AYCE was approx. $20/person Cons: It was super super  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I had to go  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  a couple  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  to cool down.  They must have had the  <START:A_Furniture> heater <END>  cranked up. Finally told them about the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  temp and they were kind and turned it down (still a little  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END> ).  Also, the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were taking FOREVER to come out.  That was the longest  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  I had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for.  They were good and fancy (seemed to be made w/extra love), but if you are in a hurry, I would sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> !  Not a very  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Not really good for big groups. Ok  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> -nothing fancy.  Overall, good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and would recommend it and would go back...prob sit at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ! :P

Thank goodness for good company! Though the  <START:Service> service <END>  was great... the rest was.. not so much. First strike: the filthiest  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  glass I have ever seen. And I normally don't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  attention to such things.. good thing I did!! Secondly, the  <START:F_Ingredients> ginger <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> dressing <END>  was quite odd. Not what Im used to, and very 'mayonaise-y' ( <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END> ).  And while the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were quite good, nothing stood out as fantastic about them. The  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  flakes on one of our  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were definitely stale.  (unless chewy  <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  flakes are the new thing...?) next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm in the Queen City, I will skip Room 112. Sorry (as for the filthy  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  glass, it was replaced even after the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  was poured in... the bottle was replaced as well).

The  <START:Food> food <END>  is just amazing! A  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is about $6 then you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  around $1 for whatever you want to add to the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , pickle..). $3 for  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and you have an option of  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END> ! (I recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> mixed <END>  one).$6 for poutines! (which are really good!) <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are $2-$3. I usually take a  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END>  and for $1 more, I get a  <START:F_FI_Size> scoops <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> vanilla <END>  icecream added to it! (just amazing)!

I have been to this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for 3  <START:S_Del_Time> times <END>  now... Their  <START:Service> service <END>  sucks...  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END>  is worst... I had  <START:F_Ingredients> papaya <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and I had  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Healthy> poisoning <END>  and I threw up on my way back to work.... I am not going back again

Great hidden gem in  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>  Town Scottsdale!  We had an Amazon deal to use and decided to stop in for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with our furry friend this weekend.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was so nice and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END>  to us and our dog on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> .  We tried a pretzel with mustard,  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>  and mozzarella  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and a homemade prickly pear  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>   <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> .  Everything was  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and delicious and a perfect  <START:Food> lunch <END> !   <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END> !

Cherries has the potential to be a decent  <START:Food> diner <END>  in Market Square, but they don't quite  <START:S_Delivery> deliver <END> . I stopped here for a late  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and grabbed a  <START:A_Furniture> stool <END>  at the counter. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was packed, which isn't saying much when the max capacity is like 30.Anyway, it took awhile to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , even just to get a cup of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . It seemed like they had enough  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , but what they were all doing, I'm not sure. So I finally got my over-easy  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> yolks <END>  already broken),  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  (crunch, crunch) and  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  (eh). Oh, the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> toast <END>  was good. I was so hungry, I didn't even care at that point.So, I finished the  <START:Food> meal <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> ,  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END> ,  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for my check. Thankfully, it was fairly inexpensive. I was happy to  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  and leave quickly to find a real cup of  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  somewhere else.

One star for the  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  besides that the  <START:Food> food <END>  was really bad I got the grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sliders and they were just plain gross. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was nasty and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like it was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  in  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> . Harsh I know.

Very good Mexican  <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> , the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are a little on the high side but  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  it when you get  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  in all the  <START:Food> food <END> !

I've been to Mundo twice now, and  <START:O_Experience> highly recommend <END>  it.  It is a  <START:F_FI_Price> bit pricey <END> , but well  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  it.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  this  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was not great, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was fantastic.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END> , which was amazing.  It came with  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  and was quite  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> , which I like.  When it arrived it was still wrapped in the paper pouch in which it was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> , so that was a bit of a mess.  I get it...  It keeps it  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  when you open it yourself.  But then I had this big  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of soggy parchment on my plate.  I had to ask a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  to take it away.  Otherwise, the  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and  <START:Food> texture <END>  were superb.  Despite the  <START:A_Env_Type> messiness <END> , it's a  <START:Food> dish <END>  well  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>   <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END> .

What a GREAT experience!   <START:Food> dinner <END>  was excellence and the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were strong.  The  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  is loud but you shouldn't be going here for a quite  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great for the beginning to your  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  out.  I recommend any of the  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  and the  <START:Food> seafood <END>  platter.

SOOOOOO much fun!!!! We had a couch under the awning across from the Dj Booth and right next to the  <START:A_Entertainment> gambling <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> !!! Perfect since we were  <START:A_Entertainment> gambling <END>  and Will I am was Dj'ing. We were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  next to two  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  of peeps in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  30's-40's and we all had a blast!!! This is not Rehab!!  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was serious parting going on, including some slipping and sliding. The  <START:A_Decor> poles <END>  in the center of the pool brought out the inner  <START:S_Staff> stripper <END>  in a lot of girls who some how managed to have heels on up  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ??? The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were awesome and our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> 's Valerie and Will were so  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> !!  We did not meet the  minimum for our bed and she was able to quickly calculate the amount of shots required to meet our quota. again SO MUCH FUN!! I will definitely go back, you should too...unless your under 25 : )

Came on a monday afternoon for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . and it was delicious! I've only had tapas twice and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was not a thing we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  that was not full of  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  and savored each and every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . We oredered:Tuna  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> : Sweet with a little kick. loved the different  <START:Food> testures <END>  of this dishceviche of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> : i didnt eat it, cause im not a fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> . but my friends loved itstuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> dates <END> : Hands down my fave  <START:Food> dish <END>  of the afternoon. it was sweet and savory and tongasmic.  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> dates <END>  and a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of  <START:F_Ingredients> nut <END>  in the center. How can you not love?? <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  Empanadas: the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  one was great and didnt feel like you were eating  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  wrapped in  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  dough. it was smooth and great  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  was good but the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  was my faveCamarones a la diabla: i didnt eat  the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  cause im not a fan of the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , but the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that came with  it was  superb! we requested more  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and i lathered it up with the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and inhaled it! Albondigas: i love  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  but i had better. the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was a bit tough and not as succulant as  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  should be. but it had delicious  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . just the  <START:Food> texture <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  turned me offLamb skewers:   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was a bit dry but non the less delicious! must eat with the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END> , the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>   all together!Filet mignon sliders: yum yum yum!def will come back when im back in vegas!

My wife and I both lived in Thailand for many years and so we enjoy trying out Thai places in the Valley. We were not disappointed with Thai  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> . Pleasant  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  (just about the only Thai  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been to with tablecloths. This could be a mistake since the usual way to eat Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  -- passing around and sharing several  <START:Food> dishes <END>  -- can get messy). We shared larb gai ( <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  minced  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>  and other things) and green  <START:F_FoodItem> curry <END> . We can recommend both, and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was enough so we could bring some home. We had both  <START:Food> dishes <END>  at " <START:F_FI_Taste> spice <END>  10," and it was quite  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END> , the way we like it. If you prefer it milder just get a lower number.

well this one beats the other one in Chandler they have a few more trays and a nicer  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END> . Everything I ate was real good from the  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  clam chowder to the  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> .This is my new favorite Chinese  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Arizona.A couple of things wrong were,my cake was still  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END>  and all the trays were not out at opening. They are new with new  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  so I hope they iron out these problems quickly other than that it was a great  <START:Food> buffet <END>  experience and I am going to put them on my top ten list for  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END> .

Twist continues to impress.  Contemporary dining  <START:A_Places> space <END>  with illuminated glass globes suspended throughout, outstanding  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  of the Strip,  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  and efficient  <START:Service> service <END> , and incredible  <START:Food> food <END> .  What more can you ask for?Straight to the  <START:Food> food <END> .  The Hudson Valley foie. Presented two ways.  Poached (sous-vide) served with a horseradish emulsion, tart sauerkraut and smoky Morteau  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> .  A great savory balance between earthy, tart, smoky  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  all cutting the richness of the foie.  Second, "nuggets" of a foie terrine "glazed" with Glenmorangie dusted with sweet and  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  gingerbread power and hazelnuts.  The smoky undertones of the single malt accentuates the mineral, livery  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the foie.  Delish.  Apple  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  on the side; perfect.The Dover sole &  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  is hard to top.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  scented  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  ("glazed" with  <START:F_FoodItem> orange <END>  cider) is brought to life by an earthy morel  <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  and vegetal  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  of turnips,  <START:F_FoodItem> coriander <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> .  The addition of  <START:F_FoodItem> prawns <END>  adds sweetness and a nice oceanic  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> .  Complex yet refreshing  <START:Food> dish <END> .The list of great  <START:Food> dishes <END>  goes on and on.  The degustation  <START:S_Menu> menus <END>  are the best way to sample Twist.   <START:A_Places> portions <END>  are scaled down so no risk of over eating (unless you have the six course grand  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> ).  Beautiful and delicious; just remember, you've been warned.  Note for  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  lovers:  Twist offers the best  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  Japanese A5 Wagyu  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Vegas.  Offered as a New York  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> ;  10 ounces, $198.   Of course, eating this would be BORING.Multiple revisits, always a twist!

I love the  <START:Food> food <END>  here, is it better than In n Out?  Not so sure.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are definitely  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and delish.  I got a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and holy moly was it alot of  <START:Food> food <END> !  I think the little  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  would have been fine and I could have easily split one  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  with my two boys.  They fill up the cup of  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , which is a good size and then dump more into the bag!  I took off one half of a star because of the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , I thought it was pretty pricey for fast  <START:Food> food <END> .  I also took off one quarter of a star for the loudness, I couldn't even hear myself think in  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  because the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was so loud.  They lose another quarter of a star because they do not offer kids  <START:Food> meals <END> .  Now that I know portion size though, I can  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  more appropriately because we had a bunch of  <START:Food> food <END>  leftover on our first visit here.  All of the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  are super nice and quick so all around I really like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and would return.

After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to try MM. However,  <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END>  was my friends birthday so we all met here for  <START:Food> dinner <END> ...The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is very "chain like", not really what I was expecting(yes, I do know it's a chain).Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Ashley, was very nice, and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> . She didn't let any of our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  go with out refills, and she split our  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> 's check for us with out us even having to ask!The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good. We had the drunken fun  <START:S_Staff> guy <END> (?)  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Both were good, not amazing, but good. Everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  a little 'processed' or maybe just not very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . The  <START:Food> crust <END>  was good and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END> , but had an almost  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwaved <END>   <START:Food> texture <END>  to it, like it was  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> ...I might give them another try, I just don't know if it's really the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for me...

This is a good Hawaiian grill! The macaroni  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  is the best around. Support your local businesses people! This is the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been to in this area.

I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  until I had a few visits to review Cartel.Firs and foremost, great  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . I have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  lattes, chai, dirty chai, and the cold brew (toddy). All have been delicious. The ratio with the chai/ <START:F_Drinks> milk <END>  is pretty spot on and the cold brew is fantastic. I would say the cold brew is probably my go to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  from now on, though the dirty chai is delicious. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  has always been very nice and helpful.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  seem to be a tinsy bit high but the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is tasty so I keep going back. The shop is a littttle pretentious but not enough to deter me.Give it a shot, you'll love the  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .

Nami is hands down my absolute favorite  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  establishment in all of PhoenixHere are a couple of words to describe Nami's tsoynami...YummyDeliciousWonderfulHeaven in a cupThe perfect dessertThe tsoynami's are  <START:F_FI_Quality> home made <END>  vegan soy  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cream <END>  which you can choose several different topping options with... <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are several  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  as well as their own creations... They are all extremely delicious but I think my top 3 are as follows...1- Dough Boychocolate  <START:F_FoodItem> chip <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cookie <END>  dough and organic chocolate2-NO's 'n' Mintnewman's  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  O's,  <START:F_Ingredients> mint <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> , organic chocolate3- Clunky Monkey (GF) <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> banana <END> , organic  <START:F_FoodItem> pecans <END> , organic chocolateThe customer  <START:Service> service <END>  at Nami is wonderful as each  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  is very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and knowledgable of the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  but they also provide very helpful tips Also, the cookies are fabulous, the cakes are scrumptious, and the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is perfect...

One of my favorite Thai  <START:Food> food <END>  places in Vegas!

Because I've changed my eating habits and have successfully lost quite a bit of weight, I try to eat  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  for my mid- <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>   <START:Food> meal <END> . Today was an exception as  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  Craig wanted us to try out two special  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> ...the Hawaiian  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and the Brie  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . My husband was able to try the Hawaiian last week, but this was my big chance and it did not disappoint. The Hawaiian is 100% angus  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  (I get the 1/3lb  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ) topped with delicious ham, melted swiss,  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , mayo and crushed  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> . I'm going to coin a 90's phrase that I feel is appropriate to describe this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ....orgasmic. Honestly. I felt the earth move when I bit into this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>   <START:Food> texture <END>  of the  <START:F_FoodItem> avocado <END>  paired so nicely with the sweetness of the  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> . The  <START:F_FI_Taste> saltiness <END>  of the ham was just right. It was sheer perfection between a sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END> ! The Brie  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is also 100% angus  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  topped with  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , sauteed  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and a slice of brie  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . It is also amazing as well. The  <START:F_FI_Quality> creamy <END>  yet tart  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END>  of the brie really lent itself nicely to the angus  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and even though my son likes his  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  grilled well done, it was still juicy and flavorful. I can't speak highly enough about NY  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> . I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back later this week to try something new!

Went here for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  with two friends. As others pointed out, the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is beautiful, rustic yet classy however the  <START:Service> service <END>  was below average and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was ok.  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  forgot our  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , had to come back to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  twice to ask us what we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  took an incredibly long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to come out and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was only two or three additional  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  filled. We asked to have the bill split three ways, it took the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  three tries to get it correct. Overall, it's probably a nice  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  to enjoy a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  but I would not recommend it for a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END>  out.

We stopped here for a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  because my fiancé is a HUGE Ramsay fan.  We got the American Kobe  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  sliders (wtf is that really?) which were about $18 for 2, but well  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  it (especially when our entire tab was comped by Trent's casino host).  The presentation was whatever and the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  was high, but let me just say that those things melted in your mouth. It was like eating a filet mignon mini- <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .  Fantabulous!  I wish we would have know that someone else was  <START:O_Payment> paying <END> , because we definitely would have sprung for the  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  Wellington for 2.  Oh well, live and learn.

Given the typical airport  <START:Food> food <END>  joints, Beaudevin is a breath of  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  in the midst of CLT's chaos. Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to spend some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  in between flights.  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  list is pretty good and the small  <START:S_Cutlery> plate. <END>  are perfect pairings.

HAPPIEST HOUR! We went to the Fleetwood Mac concert at US airways last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and one of our group had heard that they have an amazing  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> . They couldn't have been more right...They have a nice selection of draft  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  (not super extensive) but either 2 or 3 bucks at  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> , and some killer selections of  <START:Food> food <END>  for the 3-5 dollar range. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the vibe was great for pre  <START:A_Entertainment> gaming <END>  before a  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> . This is my new stop before any concert or event downtown.

My wife called to ask if they had a  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  that answered said yes, please see it online. My wife looked and when we got here (I'm here now lol), they said "oh yea our website is  <START:F_FI_Quality> old <END> . Strike one. Seaweed  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  small. Edamame small. Strike 2 was when i asked for a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  away from the front door and was told they were "reserved".  At 530pm!? ok !The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was average. Very  <START:F_FI_Size> small pieces <END> . Very loud due to teppan right next to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . All in an  <START:A_Environment> open area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are no  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  or anything. Strike 3 was when they brought out my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  with only half of the nigiri. Weird, if you write "1" for nigiri it's literal, not in pairs as about every other  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I've been to for 20 years all over the globe, does!Well I asked for the rest of the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and I was told if have to be out at the back of the  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> . Meaning I'd be waiting much too long. Ridiculous. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was average. Very  <START:F_FI_Size> small pieces <END> . Very loud due to teppan right next to  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . All in an  <START:A_Environment> open area <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are no  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  or anything. Sakana and Mido are better in all ways. I'd be surprised to see them make it to 2014.

Fantastic! I've watched shows where the host goes to a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , tries their  <START:Food> foods <END>  and explains the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> , textures, and so forth. I never really understood until I came to this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .So I'm going to keep it simple: this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Quality> clean <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , made to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . You can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  every single  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END> , layer by layer. A must go-back-to.

If you like trendy joints check it out. The one  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  had good customer  <START:Service> service <END>  since he switched an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to something else nicely. The  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  not that good. Their specialty are the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> !! You cant go wrong. The  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  are freakin amazing! I requested for sweet  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  ( <START:F_Appetizer> sweet   potato   fries <END> ). The  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>  with 3 strips of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was def not  <START:F_FI_Price> worth <END>  the money. Coulda made that myself.

Amazing foooood!!!!That calamari is to die for, it has  <START:F_FI_Size> slices <END>  of  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  jalapeno and freshly made tartar  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that has a kick of  <START:F_FoodItem> lemon <END> . The 4  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  is superb! It  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like a  <START:F_FI_Taste>     crisp <END> .  calzone and when paired with the homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  it is magical. lolThis is not your traditional  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  it's  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  it's gormet and FULL of  <START:F_Ingredients> flavor <END> !! The  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  put some high dollar restuarants to shame.LOve Love Love

Loved this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! Sat out of the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  today for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  to watch some of the opening  <START:S_OpenHours> day <END>  Red Sox  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> .  <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing.  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Ipswich  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  clams which were relish and straight out of a Cape Cod  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Husband had the Italian, which was enormous and enough to bring home half for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection - more than  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END> . I had the Lobster  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  special and was everything I expected it to be. Thanks for the Cracker Jacks Tim! This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is great, be back very soon

I am saddened by the demise of this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  We walked in and had to "yoo hoo" to get  <START:S_Staff> server <END> / <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  attention. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was pitifully empty on a Saturday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  at 7:30. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our usual  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  satay  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  which was not "as good as usual",  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was on the dry side and the peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was lumpy. As wew  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  for our  <START:Food> food <END> , I saw a bug on the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  which i had to deal with under the weight of my flip flop. It was then that i noticed how utterly filthy the  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  was.  My husband agreed, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had undeniably succumbed to a fate several ethnic  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  at this very location have suffered.  We pondered what else could be unwashed beside the floors and what else could possibly be creepy crawlin around the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> . I left with the heebie jeebies and we both agreed we would not venture back. So very sad :(

Whenever I am in this (LAME) part of town, I try to go to this little  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Today I had their  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  with mole. Always amazing! Love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and wish they would be closer to the west side!

We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 10"  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with gluten-free  <START:Food> crust <END> ... with feta  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . They said delivery would take about an hour, and they were right. We're literally a mile from them so that was kind of crazy but they told us ahead of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  so not a huge deal.I can't comment on what the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  looks like on the inside because I've never been. We'll  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  again but the lack of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  will ensure that this isn't our  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  spot. Even with us getting *extra*  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  still wasn't a lot. I'm a total cheeseaholic, so that was disappointing. <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> hot <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  were great, delivery  <START:S_Staff> driver <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> . Can't really complain. :)

I REALLY ENJOYED THE  <START:Food> food <END> !  Very  <START:Food> creative <END>  Hispanic  <START:Food> dishes <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  as well. The  <START:A_Environment> atmosphere <END>  is quite nice as well. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is brand new and has the formula down pat.  GO NOW GRASS HOPPER!

I'm just an avid  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  lover in a town filled with Japanese-influenced  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , but it isn't as easy to find a great  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for such a raw delicacy as you might think. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that has delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END> , scrumptious  <START:Food> food <END> , great and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , AND a vivacious  <START:Ambience> ambience <END> . Do i need to say anymore? Come see why Kanji has such a high rating for yourself.

I had  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  yesterday before the Pirates  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END>  with a few friends.  I have also been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few times upstairs.  I really liked the fact that we had no problem getting a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  or a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> .  I usually go to the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bars <END>  on the North Shore prior to Pirates  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> , but this was a lot less  <START:Ambience> crowded <END>  and good for the group I was with.  In fact, truth be told the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was only about 1/2 full (on Bucs opening day!?).  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was okay.  I tried these  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  which were good and interesting because it had a decent  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  as the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and not just ground  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  I also really liked the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem>   potato     fries   <END> .   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and you usually can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  get these at too many places.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .  It was a ton of  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> , however some of the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  was a little  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END>  and it was  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold.  I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END> , but  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold really wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  that good when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  on it.  I also tried the  <START:F_Appetizer> tortilla   soup   <END> , which was really rich and had a good  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The only thing missing in the  <START:F_Appetizer> tortilla   soup   <END>  was the  <START:F_FoodItem> tortilla   chips   <END> .  A minor oversight I imagine.  Overall, a pretty decent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  when you are looking to just have a few  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  with friends.  I've also tried the upstairs  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  which is the more upscale section.  The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  including  <START:A_Furniture> leather couches <END> .  The  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 PM.  Overall a decent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for quiet  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  without the crowds and a little better than average  <START:Food> food <END> .

We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and only ate  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , but all-in-all it was an excellent  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> !  Craig and the other  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END>  (sorry i forgot her name... <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was very sweet) were on top of it, and  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent. The  <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  were good too.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  made our Charlotte  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  better. Thanks!

I just had  <START:Food> lunch <END>  at the Phoenix City Grille. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty good, but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was not the best.  I got the Green Chile  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , and it was pretty good. We were  <START:Service> served <END>  quickly, but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  come check on us for several minutes. I needed  <START:F_Ingredients> mayonnaise <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , but I had to wait at least  <START:S_Del_Time> 10 minutes <END>  for the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to return to ask for it. I also had a  <START:F_Drinks> mimosa <END> . It was good, but the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  never asked if I  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> cared <END>  for another. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  only asked me if I wanted more  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  when it was  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to leave the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  It also seemed to take awhile to get the check and  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for the  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was only moderately busy, and it seems like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  only had a few  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  working. I really don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  fault the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> . It just seems like  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  was waiting on too many people.

Very nice  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  and a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to see live bands

************The  <START:Food> dinner <END>  plates are .......  a Good Value**************          The  <START:Food> dinner <END>  Plates come with a Nice Size Greek  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with Feta  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .          Plus a side of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  or French  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  and Pita  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .      We've eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  three times ...... the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was disappointing.The last two times .......... HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING.The  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  are very generous .....and the seasoning RIGHT ON.                             My Wife enjoyed her Kabob ......                     My Gyros ...... the best I've had in Arizona

Of course if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  claim to have the best  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> -I had to try them. I liked the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , nice  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  pieces, deep  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END> , not too heavy on the  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END> . Although I found the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  a bit dry, and I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think their  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  was  <START:Food> anything <END>  special-but at least  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ! I asked for just the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  charged me and gave me the entire  <START:Food> meal <END> , therefore only three stars...and my search for  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  continues.

We went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for our anniversary tonight . I havent ate a red  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  for 10 years because of how gross it was! But we decided it was  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  again after reentering the real world ( we justed moved back from the bush alaska) . And to tell you it wasnt bad at all. I really enjoyed my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> ! And my  <START:F_Drinks> alcoholic   drink   <END>  actually had alcohol in it

Ok, so I've never been a fan of Domino's in the past and I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  say much has changed since  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  said  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had redone their recipe for a "better"  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . The  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  is just too overly seasoned. That really turns me off. It  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put way too much  <START:F_Ingredients>   garlic   powder <END>  combined with Mrs. Dash on it, ew.The texture is ok, but it's really not doing it for me. I prefer  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  Hut or Papa John's still if I'm going for a  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  on the quick.

If I ever leave Las Vegas Capriotti's will be the only thing I miss.  This is the only Capriotti's I went to that had an actual dine in  <START:Ambience> sit down area <END> .  All the other Capriotti's I've gone to had 2 or 3  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  for their  <START:Ambience> sit down area <END>  and that was it.  I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  put  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>  on all of their  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  so I always  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  w/no  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END>  since I'm not a fan of it.  My favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is the  <START:F_FoodItem> capastrami <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sla-be-joe <END>  was ok and the  <START:F_FoodItem> bobby <END>  is always a good choice.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have plenty of other  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  to choose from but I haven' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  tried any others because I always get the  <START:F_FoodItem> capastrami <END> .  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are a little more than what you'd expect from a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but I feel like it's definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it and it's still very reasonable.  A small  <START:F_FoodItem> 9 inch sub <END>  is around $7, a  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  12 inch is $9 and a  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  20 inch is $13.  Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  you eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  give you a $3 off coupon for your next visit.  You have to go online and fill out a short questionnaire but it's  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it to get some money off for your next visit.  Other than the  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>  overload the only thing I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  close at 8 but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are still deserving of 5 stars despite of that.

After nearly 4 years I've finally ventured out to Chaya.  What took me so long?  I'm always mildly hesitant about  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  when I'm in a city not by the coast, but a man does what he's gotta do when he's got a craving.Three of us  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combination platter to split as well as our own  <START:Food> food <END> .  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail cheeks <END> , my friend  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  eel, and my last friend is boring.First came the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  It was pretty standard, but any sign of  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetation <END>  is a good thing for the college male.Next up was their  <START:F_FoodItem> karaage <END> .  Ohmygoodness it was the best  <START:F_FoodItem> karaage <END>  I have ever had.  Now I've never had  <START:F_FoodItem> karaage <END>  in Japan, but lots of people hyped it up for me and I was scared it would be a letdown.  The flesh was so flavorful and juicy it completely blew my mind away and left me craving more as soon as it was over.  Drool. <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  was also pretty standard.The  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combination was a disappointment.  Yes, we had it coming for  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  a platter of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , but it was only b/c the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  platters would have either been too  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  (the 70 dollar boats) or too small (the 10 piece combo's).  In retrospect we should have just  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a la carte Nigiri...  I noticed halfway through the  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had Anago available that night too...My  <START:F_FoodItem> yellowtail cheeks <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  Personally I love  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  cheeks (as well as the part of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  right by the tail when I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  whole).  It's super  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and rich and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  so delicate.My end of the bill came out to be around 30, which was perfectly.  I would've been perfectly happy if we had dropped the  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combination and I had picked up a piece of Toro and a piece of Anago instead. <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent and the their timing was impeccable;  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have it all down to an  <START:A_Decor> art <END> .  The next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I'm back I completely want to try their Omakase.  In Japanese it means "It's up to you" with "you" being the  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> I was slightly  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END>  when I saw my companions throw their wasabi into soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and completely mix it up.  That is not how  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  should be eaten.....

Cabo is my favorite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . As a  <START:Ambience> huge <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  lover I am always in heaven when I visit. No matter what you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  everything is always  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  items aren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  overly complicated and the featured specials are always a hit. Two thumbs up!

 <START:W_Price> worth <END>  every damn  <START:W_Price> penny <END> .

Who wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ?? The weather is  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  so we  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  Jimmy Johns.  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  it at 1:39...he rings my bell at 1:50. Needless to say the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great. From  <START:S_Delivery> ordering <END>  to receiving its an all around good  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .

very  <START:A_Decor> trendy <END>  mexican  <START:Restaurant> resturant <END>  that has horrible  <START:Service> service <END>  from old ladies who can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  hear or move fast enough to keep your  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  filled.  and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  smells very bad.  i suggest a little remodeling along with some spring cleaning.

Since my last review I have been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  many times and I must say  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  has improved a lot!  I really do love their  <START:Food> food <END> ... as of late I am stuck on their Artesian  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  Melt... YUM!  So  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get another star:)

Went to grab a quick  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  yesterday with a colleague and we decided to go to Pita House.   <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  Mistake.We called in our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> gal <END>  on the phone seemed like it we were putting her out.  I guess the computer in the non  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  section (where we'd be picking up our  <START:Food> food <END> ) was down.  We weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  told how long it would be or how much our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  was going to cost.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem>   gyro   pita <END>  with the house  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . We head over,  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  and get out  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  (the  <START:S_Staff> gal <END>  seemed irritated to have to walk over to the other side to run the card), and head back to work.  I dive into my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and something is off.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END> , like wilted  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END> .  Who wants to eat  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  floppy  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> ?  Anyone...Anyone...Bueller?    My  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END>  was drowning in tzatziki.  I ended up throwing most of my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  away -   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no salvaging any of it.  Not sure if  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's new  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> management <END> ...but the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END>  has definitely gone downhill.  If I return, it wont be for a while.

Ive been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  like 5 times now and the only thing I get is the Danny's special. That's the only reason I give it a 5 star lol Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  speak for  <START:Food> anything <END>  else!Anyway, the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are AMAZING. I hate when  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are soggy on the outside,  but these are perrrfect,  <START:F_FI_Taste> crispy <END>  on the outside but still smothered in  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I get the  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END>  and my boyfriend usually gets the  <START:F_FoodItem> teriyaki <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are both delish. AND it comes with  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> !  10  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  & seasoned  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>  for like 8 bucks, always hits the spot and fills me up

the outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  is great with the  <START:A_OutsideView> waterfall <END>  in the  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was mediocre, while the  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and outdoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  great, i would  <START:O_Experience> not go back <END>  secondary to the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END> . to note:  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve until 2 am!

Never had a bad  <START:Food> meal <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Good  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is always  <START:Ambience> crowded <END> . Great for people watching.

I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  twice and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> ! The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went it was very packed for the USA World Cup  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . I split the pretzel  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , which came with  <START:F_FoodItem> phenomenal   mustard   <END> . The pretzels were  <START:F_FI_Size> massive <END>  and really  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END> , soft, and great. I shared the Tap Room Tenderloin and  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  it with Chipotle  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . It was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly and the chipotle really enhanced the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> . Would definitely recommend. Shared a pitcher of Sunbru which was really great and refreshing on a hot summer day. The second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I went with  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  from New Jersey who are quite picky folks.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had just gotten in from a long flight and were starved.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were SUPER  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END>  with the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> , both of my parents  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  flights and loved all. As for  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> - we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , which to our  <START:A_Environment> pleasant <END>  surprise were way  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicier <END>  than expected, the  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> artichoke dip <END> , which was filled with way more  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  than I had ever had, the Thai Hummus, which was superb, and a  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> goat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bruchetta <END> . Every single  <START:Food> item <END>  that touched my Sunbru cleansed palette was amazing. Not one thing was bland,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were all kicked with amazing  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END>  and combinations I could never replicate. Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to keep trying the great things on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> !

For the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  and the amount of  <START:Food> food <END>  you get, I think it's only ok.  I'm a small little girl with a  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  stomach. I went to earls afterwards and put down a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , a  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , and half a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great tho.  It's just a little too quiet in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for me. I almost fell asleep.

DEL INFERNO, MI CORAZONThis DT caught my eye one night while we were driving back to our room. Had I been driving, we surely would have been rear-ended because I have a tendency to slam on my brakes when I see their happy signs.Note: I only  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> . Whether I'm at Del  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  Bell, I do not stray from my simple  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> : between 3 and 8 crunchy  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> . I usually prefer them with  <START:A_Decor> light <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and extra  <START:F_Ingredients> lettuce <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have to have 3 packets of hot  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  (I like to use one  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END> , one  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> , and one hot) and a half-packet of  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> . So  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  we are in Vegas and I see DT, so of course (!) I made my husband park even though we'd been on our feet all day and were exhausted. We found a  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  spot several blocks away and walked through a detour for construction and around some dark corners until we were finally back on the strip and headed up to the  <START:Food> food <END>  court. A polite  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  gave me my  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  ($1.59 each) and the night was complete. Del  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  - please come to Walnut Creek, CA :)  xoxo

Stoped by with the  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  for my little sister's birthday,  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a cheeseburger and Mozzerella Sticks. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  sticks were  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , also very  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . The have these amazing super  <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  shoestring  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  with  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>  seasoning. First  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I've been to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , usually frequent Town Square but is very comparable.  <START:Service> service <END>  is very  <START:Service> consistent <END>  between the two.  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END> , good  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> , great  <START:Service> service <END> , and plenty of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> . A little bit  <START:W_Price> pricey <END>  depending what you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , but overall a nice dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .

Probably the best  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in town. Wood fired oven (used for  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , of course) also bakes their own  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> , and wonderfully  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasts <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> vegetables <END>  for their vege,  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> .  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a nice short list of house  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END> , or build your own to suit. Obscure  <START:S_Menu>   wine   list <END>  is fine, no harm trying a selection you haven' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  heard of before. Deserts are all homemade as well.

Best  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  I have ever had...the French Kiss  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END>  with Bailey's and Kahlua...and this is coming from someone who worked at Baskin Robbins through high school.  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  were  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> . My boyfriend and I chose the angus build-a- <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly and we really liked the ciabatta  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> . The jalapeno  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  was  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> . The  <START:Food> chipotle aioli <END>  was really  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END>  and good for dipping the sweet  <START:F_FoodItem>   potato     fries   <END> .  We will definitely return!

 <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> Colicchio, the naming of a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  cannot be more apt. And forgive little ole me for claiming that you, sir, got the craft of  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> , down to a science. In my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> , while other  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  excel on  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END> ,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  typically fall apart when it comes to a collective  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  with the inclusion of the sides. Our selections of  the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  risotto,  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  gratinand Brentwood sweet corn had our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  clamoring for more.Oh, how I wish to revisit the evening soon.

I have been to the Great Dane for dinning and for just drinking on several occasions. I love the  <START:A_Decor> layout <END>  of the  <START:Ambience> building <END>  and the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> . The Dane  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is great. I also enjoy the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END> . If you just want  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  I recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soft pretzels <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> artichoke dip <END> ! Of course you can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  forget the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  sampler!

Maybe i am just a sucker for  <START:Food> buffet <END> , but i like this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . It isnt the best i've had.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  dont have a  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  section, just some  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , and clams and  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  ( <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> ), which are good nuff for me, considering the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . It is $18.95 sat-thru  <START:Food> dinner <END> , which is more reasonable than other hotel  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  in vegas. Friday night is  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  night, but i've never been. my Fave items  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  are: Prime Rib (fill up on these),  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> cream <END>  sprinkled on top,  <START:F_FoodItem> basil <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> cream <END>  rotellini. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is decent ( <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  being the best) and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have a "make your own  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> " Station, for the picky eaters, about 40 different  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  ( <START:F_Dessert> chocolate mousse cake <END>  is best). and the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , while  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , has a little funk on the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . It's borderline Chinese BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> -ish.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  should stick to one. A cross between  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  Kansas city BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and hoisin based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  isnt that great on the palate.Nothing much to complain about. Not too many people know about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , so it is never  <START:Ambience> crowded <END>  the 3 times I've gone (i go to vegas quite a bit my friends).  <START:Service> service <END>  is ok. And  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is  <START:Ambience> huge <END> , so you will be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  :)

I'm a little late on writing this since I was in Vegas over Super Bowl weekend, but it's still  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  writing about.This WOULD HAVE been the best  <START:Restaurant> steakhouse <END>  I've ever been to, but it sadly wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END> .  This evening, I wanted to  <START:Service> treat <END>  my gf out to a great  <START:Food> dinner <END>  before hitting up Zumanity.  As usual, we ran a few minutes late, but  <START:S_Del_Time> 10 minutes <END>  isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>   <START:Food> anything <END>  to fuss over at 99.9% of  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .  However, it took them over THIRTY minutes to  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  us.  Umm...with a show we don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  want to be late for, that's some crumby  <START:S_Staff> management <END>  of  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> .For the most part, the  <START:Service> service <END>  was top notch and the  <START:S_Staff> sommelier <END>  was great.  For  <START:Food> dinner <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the chateaubriand, the foir gras torchon, an iceberg  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  sides, and a great Bordeaux  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> .The  <START:Food> food <END>  was, for the most part, SUPERB.  Even the sides were as decadent as the hibernate entrée.  I just wish we had had more  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in the chateaubriand was juicy,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , and everything one could hope for as far as red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  goes.  The  <START:F_FoodItem>   foie gras   torchon <END>  was excellent, just a little rich for my palate.  I've had  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END>  every way you could have it and honestly, I prefer pan seared.In the end, we had a rushed  <START:Food> dinner <END>  because of being  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  late, getting the check took forever because of some "system problem", and we ended up being late to Zumanity!  GRRRR!It ended up being okay though, because when we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , one of the "actors" gave us shit about being late, but after we explained what happened, he hooked us up with front row/couch  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END> !  Thanks, SW for the Cirque upgrade, I guess...

Spoiler alert: the bill is average $120 per person.With that being said, if you want to be a foodie...or at least  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> act <END>  the part...or just be  <START:Service> treated <END>  like you own the Bellagio for a night, come right on down.  It's located down the escalators and it will be one of the most decadent  <START:Food> meals <END>  of your life.I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  claim to know  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  or  <START:F_Drinks> liqueurs <END>  but I know  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  must be seriously good for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is great about suggesting pairings with your  <START:Food> meal <END> .  What I do claim to know is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do deliver.You can pick from 2  <START:S_Menu> menus <END> : the Degustation  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (5 course) or the Prix Fixe (4 course).  With only a $10 difference, I opted for the 5 course.  I will summarize because many have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  the gloriousness that I have and have lived to write about it as well.Maine  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> :  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  as in  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , etc.  Cool, refined, and accentuates the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END> .  Not overly drowned in superfluous additives like mayo.Pan-seared Scallop:  I have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> scallops <END> ... but this was  <START:A_Decor> picture <END> -perfect, cut-with a fork, sophisticatedly simple. <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END> : probably my least favorite but only by personal  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  Nice blacked  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>  with a tangy center.  Basically blackened  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END> .Kobe Filet Mignon: yes ladies and gentlemen, I chose to add $160 to my  <START:Food> meal <END>  and try this heavenly cut of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> .  Perfectly marbled and juicy (recommended  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> -rare).  While I may not agree that it should cost an additional $160, I cannot deny that it was the highlight of my  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and probably the best cut of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  I have ever  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .  Also accompanied by a the best ring of mashed  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  but still no contest.  You can get kobe cuts across the street at Gordon Ramsay  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  in Paris and frankly better than  <START:Food> anything <END>  I've eaten in my life (until I ate at Picasso). <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> :  by now you will be full and probably not appreciate the choice as much as you should.  Tough choices... but if you make it this far, congratulations and  <START:Restaurant> here <END> 's to hoping payday comes soon after this  <START:Food> meal <END> .Great  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ... <START:S_Staff> they <END>  know that for a lot of us, this  <START:Food> meal <END>  hurts the pockets, but  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:S_Stf_Behavior> guide <END>  you through it and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  talk like all those fancy  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  in the movies too

Not the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was giving outstanding  <START:Service> service <END> .

Why on EARTH would  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> Aaron Sanchez put his name on any of the  <START:Food> food <END>  at this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> ?! Horrible! Tasteless! Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  waste your  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Perhaps as a  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  venue it is OK, but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was disgusting. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Sure the crunch was spot on but it was under  <START:F_Ingredients> salted <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> spiced <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  itself  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like worn out shoe leather. I followed this by one of  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> Sanchez's signature  <START:Food> dishes <END>  - a half rack of  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> . One  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  into it and I was sorely  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  must have been steamed or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiled <END> . It too was  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavorless <END> . To cover this up, it was slathered with a  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_Ingredients> ketchup <END>  with hints of cayenne. This is not at all what I expected from an Adobo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . It was just straight up YUCK! I had it all packaged up to take back to my hotel and was SO angry I tossed it in the garbage as I walked back to my room. Shame on you Aaron Sanchez. Either take your good name off such horse-menure  <START:Food> food <END>  or fire your executive  <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END> and get someone who knows how to make it the way you intended it.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is adorable, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  give great  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . What's not to love!?

3.5 starsOur  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was incredibly nice and the Calamari  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Linguini al Mare and the description made it sound like  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  with marinara  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> . It was actually like a  <START:F_FoodItem> cioppino <END> , which is not my favorite thing and having the linguini sitting in  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  great. If you like  <START:F_FoodItem> cioppino <END>  though,  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are very generous with the  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> .My bf got the  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  Orzo and he said it was way too  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END> . Still pretty good, but it needed more  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  or something to balance out the  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END> We were kind of  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> , which is sad because we LOVE this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , especially the one in LA.

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is amazing! I had the best BBQ ever....the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  were do  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> melted <END>  in my mouth and the Mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was so good too! Highly recommend this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  and Donny,  <START:S_Staff> the manager <END> ,  really  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> cared <END>  that we were happy.

As visitors to Phoenix this past weekend, our group decided we wanted some  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Mexican  <START:Food> cuisine <END> . We found a review for this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  online and drove about 20 minutes (to what seemed like BFE) and finally arrived with hungry bellies. We were  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greeted <END>  by all 5 of the ladies standing near the entrance who  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  us quickly. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  arrived at our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  quickly for our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  and was quite helpful. My only complaint about the  <START:Service> service <END>  is that my friend's father wanted to try their $4 Rita-tini (?) that was advertised on the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  that was made with 3 Amigos Tequila. When he asked for the $4 special, we were told it was strictly for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> . The sign itself said absolutely nothing about  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>  - and the only reason I mention this is because every other sign in the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  that offered a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  special -only for  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> - designated that clearly on the sign. The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  amused when he jokingly asked if  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  could make an exception. Our  <START:Food> meals <END>  were simply  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . The carne asada was easily the best carne asada I've ever had, and being from Southern California I would like to think we have quite the selection. I personally  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a 2  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  plate, which included  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  differently from any other  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I have ever been to, it was incredibly juicy and surprisingly flavorful. I couldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  pin point exactly what the other people at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  had  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , but we were all settling into  <START:Food> food <END>  comas shortly after commencing our delightful  <START:Food> lunch <END>  (which wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  the best thing considering we all had a 5 hour drive to make back to California).If I ever find myself in Phoenix again, or even somewhere remotely close by- I would definitely stop in for another  <START:Food> meal <END> .

We went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at 5 pm for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with my adult kids to celebrate my wife's birthday.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great. Everyone seemed  <START:S_Stf_Appearance> professional <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> .My kids love the Chilean Sea bass that was suggested by the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , we even  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the second one.My wife was happy getting an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from my kids a Giant Fortune Cookie with a "Happy Birthday" written on the plate.We went home with a good memory and would like to come back when we are in Vegas next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .

We found this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  via Opentable.com for our 10th wedding anniversary. The  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  bad. The Palms Hotel is not on the strip. You would have to take a cab to get  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . The average fare for a single trip: $10My husband  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>  spaghetti. I forgot the name of  <START:Food> dish <END> . Out of world! Good  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> bone-in ribeye <END> . My gosh, the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  was so juicy and I decided to keep some for home so I could enjoy chewing the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END> .  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  a trip!

This  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is definitely just ok.  For $200 plus for three people I expect more.   <START:Food> food <END>  ok, nothing special.  You can get better at Wendy's Asian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on Spring Mountain and Jones!  And definitely better  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  at Raku.  Japanaise is a lovely looking  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with very cool  <START:Ambience> ceilings <END>  but it ends  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  I didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like having a paper overlay on my tablecloth or the fact that the busboy took my fork off my used  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  plate and placed it back on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  for me to use on entrée.  Also, one of the three  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  arrived ten minutes after the other two were  <START:Service> served <END> .  Wanted to be polite, so I waited, and then my  <START:Food> dish <END>  was cold when I got to eat it.  What is the delay in getting a Hamachi  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  to the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ?  I truly throught  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot my daughter's  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  it took so long.  I also said it was a birthday  <START:Food> dinner <END>  when I made  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and was told  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  acknowledge it.  Also whispered it to  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END> .  Nothing!  I am local and think I expect more  <START:Service> service <END> .  I won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  be coming back for sure.

Goodness gracious alive, do I ever love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .I head out to U.S.  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  a couple of Sundays a month with my roomie and her pops.  We are  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>   <START:W_Waiting> speedily <END> , and any number of leggy beauties are at our beck and call for the entirety of our stay.  The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  is gracious, and the  <START:S_Staff> waitresses <END>  are perpetually smiling.  The vibe is  <START:A_Decor> light <END> .The clientele runs from old folks to hipsters to the hangover crowd.  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has quite a bit to choose from, but I always have the  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  florentine (try it; i promise you won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  regret it).   I've heard tell that the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>  benedict and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  over easy are remarkable, as well.   <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  leave a pitcher of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  cold  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  with us as we eat-- <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  pester us or rush us or hint that we need to leave, even when our conversations run long.  I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think of a better  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to get  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .

The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is good. I looove the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> . It is young and fun. Yes,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is amigos... but a wise man would know that  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is not about that, but the dedication and love of the  <START:Food> food <END> . I eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  once a week. I do have to agree though that the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END>  or  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  are not included. But its good and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>   <START:Service> treat <END>  you well.

I used to go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a lot for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  when I worked in Old Town, if the line wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  super long. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END> , all the while keeping it really  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . Everything I have tried has not  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END>  and the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  is so good. Turkey club was my usual  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .

Sardella's does a pretty decent  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and with the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  it's convenient to stop in an pick one up on the way home. That's about as good as it gets. It's like  <START:F_FoodItem> rolling <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Size> dice <END>  when you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . You ask for blue  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  with your  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  you get ranch. You  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  without an  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  you are allergic to, you might get the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END>  anyway. And honestly, how hard is it to cut a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  think I've ever been to a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  that has cut a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in a way that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were little triangle pieces in the middle. Not just once, but 3 times. Today was the last straw, I truly saw what was behind this locations issues. I spoke to a  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>  behind the counter that appeared to be running the store about my last  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  that was supposed to be half works, but ended up less than a third covered with  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> . His feed back was "yeah?', 'Have you ever tried to make a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ?'. Are you kidding me? I told him I was only trying to bring it to his attention and he continued on with 'Listen, I have to feed 100 people/hour'. That's a great attitude and clearly shows that  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  Assurance is NOT Sardella's primary objective. Take it for what it is, I've been coming to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on just about a weekly basis but I can confidently say that I can only put up with so much.

LOVE THIS  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  i could eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .  i always go for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with friends or for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> .  great for kids.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is grass for the kids to run around on.  it is like going on a picnic at the park but with great  <START:Food> food <END> .  we go about once a month! well maybe more!

 <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> ..  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was helpful. Just made a quick stop before a concert with my lady. I will definantley try to go back next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i'm in the area..!!

I had the worst  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  ( <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  skin  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ) in my life  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! It was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burnt <END> .... other  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  are medocre at best. Mido and kabuki are way better than this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .

Pho-gettaboudit... not  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> , the spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were over- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in the pho was no bueno.  The others at my  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  seemed to enjoy their  <START:Food> meal <END> , but I think  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're just used to being let down.Also, let me stand on my soap box and announce something to all small business  <START:S_Staff> owners <END> .  You don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like it when people  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  with credit or debit cards?  You don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  that 3-4.5% fee for electronic  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  customers?  Huh.  Well guess what... you should build that into your  <START:W_Price> pricing <END> !  'Cause guess what?  NO ONE likes to see a sign that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  will be  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  50 cents or whatever extra just because  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have cash.  It rubs me the wrong way almost every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  - and I know I'm not the only one.  So - in the best interest of your getting people to RETURN and RECOMMEND your  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of business to others?  Get with the 21st century and suck it up - debit / credit cards aren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  going anywhere.

My parents owned a Korean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  so I know good Korean  <START:Food> food <END> ! I enjoyed their Kalbi (short  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> ) kalbi tang (short rib  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ) bulgogi ( <START:F_FI_Size> thin <END>  marinated  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ) tofu  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> mackerel combo <END>  and their  <START:F_FoodItem> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  has been times where the side  <START:Food> dishes <END>  weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  as good. For instance the  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  kimchi was soggy and  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts were bland but the hibernate  <START:Food> dishes <END>  made up for it.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  do get busy so the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  button that's on every  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  comes in handy when you need something.

The iceberg  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with what was kindly called " <START:F_FoodItem> buttermilk ranch <END> ", actually just "buttermilk" i'm pretty sure....was sub-optimal.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  were good, and the special I got the night I went was freaking amazing.  Overall, it was a semi-quiet  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to sit and have a  <START:Food> meal <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were very polite and excellent, I was never wanting for a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , and everything ran very smoothly.

Chocolate  <START:F_FoodItem> cupcake <END>  - real good.

Sweet, sweet gluttonous Maizie's. I always emerge from the dimly  <START:A_Decor> lit <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  riddled with guilt at my lack of self control, but I keep coming back for more!  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  is hectic and the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  remains consistently busy, but neither are such an issue that I would feel hesitant to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .The inside has urban swank and remains unpretentious. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> personable <END>  but not  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> overbearing <END> . And the  <START:Food> food <END> ...oh God, the  <START:Food> food <END> ! The buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  dip is cheesy, high calorie, ooey gooey  <START:F_FI_Taste> deliciousness <END> .  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  chunks of partially  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> melted <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  swim in the dip, making it incredibly filling. The  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  pesto  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is way too good as well...thick cuts of  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> , dripping  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , generously spread pesto and perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> crisp <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  is amazing! What a unique idea. I love the quirky, well balanced  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is something to fit most moods and cravings. I need to come in for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and brunch to see what the day  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  is like, but I'm sure I won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  be  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> .

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is in the popular section of Old Montreal.  We had our first Monsieur Croquette - who knew a  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  could be so  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  We also had the  <START:F_FoodItem>   smoked     salmon   <END>  which was  <START:O_Experience> very satisfying <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> .  The best part is the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  and the  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  from the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  for people watching.

We love this  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have the best  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  in town and great  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:W_Price> prices <END>  and selection. Try the Las Vegas  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> -- so good!

Absolutely amazing!!! We were 3 guys. I went with 2 other guys and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are both real foodies. We all said that it might have been top 3  <START:Food> meal <END>  of all  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . No one had  <START:Food> anything <END>  slightly bad to say. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  like champions. We shared 4  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , 2  <START:F_FoodItem> mains <END> , and 2  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END> . The Duck  <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END>  was IMPECCABLE! Duck in a can was an  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  and it was well  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. It is really a  <START:Service> treat <END>  to dine at a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  like PDC.

Very impressive.We sat at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  overlooking the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  prepare every  <START:Food> dish <END> .  It was a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  being in the thick of it and seeing them work so cohesively - when it came to our  <START:Food> food <END>  we appreciated it even more!The  <START:F_FoodItem> foie gras <END>  poutine was excellent.  My only complaint would have been to have had more  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> , but I guess this isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  necessarily a bad thing! We had considered getting a  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  (given the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  name involves a pig) but decided to go for Duck in a can.  Its unique and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .Would recommend going  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you are in Montreal, but make a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END> !

Farmer Boys is OK for a change. Nothing spectacular  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , just good  <START:Food> food <END> , good  <START:W_Price> price <END> .I do find that  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  slop too much  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> .  Not one of the top  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  places in Vegas.

I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  know why I was so reluctant to dine at the Nordstrom Cafe at first;  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  after  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  proves to be  <START:F_FI_Quality> superior <END>  to other local offerings, regardless of the particular Nordstrom  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> . In this case, we were at the Fashion Show  <START:F_FI_Size> mall <END> , and I opted for the cranberry  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  on the advice of the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> . My wife got the blackened  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  on a Caesar  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . Both were excellent, and the  <START:Service> service <END>  as always was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> .The only thing I would point out is that the room temperature always seems to lean a bit towards the polar  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>  caps side of the thermometer. For me, this is a plus, but be warned if you are one of those people who likes a  <START:F_FI_Quality> warm <END>  room.

 <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's not much else to say that hasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  already been said. Behold, the £2.00 sub!Serving up a lovely variety of scrummy fillings, All Good lives up to its good name by delivering excellent  <START:Service> service <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , soft filled  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and the £2 sub deal that has successfully bowled me over.Even during  <START:Food> lunch <END>  hour you will  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  speedy  <START:Service> service <END>  from  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , and plenty to choose from off their up-to-date  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Their website is pretty straightforward to navigate - fun and modern while also giving you some insight into the lunchtime  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Great if you're nipping in on your  <START:Food> lunch <END>  hour or have a busy day of shopping ahead of you, All Good is really good at spoiling us!

Everything is bad but the $2 Miller lites

Black Dog has THE best BBQ in the Champaign/Urbana area hands down.  Now all  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need is a larger  <START:A_Places> space <END>  to serve it in, i love the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  setting, but not one that has outgrown its  <START:A_Places> space <END>  because of how good their product is.  Waits are common of up to 30 mins anytime you go.As for the  <START:Food> food <END> , lets start with the  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> smoked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  and the kick of the Carolina BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  puts them over the top.  My wife can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  stop talking about how good the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burnt <END>  ends are, and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  must not be the only one because the sell out frequently.   Loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END> , just wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had some baby backs to choose from.All in all you will not beat this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for BBQ anywhere within a hundred miles!

 <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and a good value. Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  let the name fool you, not everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is greasy. Wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had a little more indoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  so one could avoid the flies and the heat, but I guess that is part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 's character.

 <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>  pho  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  I usually get the #7 ( <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chickens <END> .)  Although the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  Pho is pretty good too.  Honestly, I have not been  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END>  an  <START:Food> anything <END>  I've had from  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  The Thai  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> iced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> tea <END>  is really good, too.  When you first walk in to the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , you may think twice - it is an old  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  bell converted to vietnamese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  But don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  let that stop you - the  <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent.  I've gotten a lot of people hooked on the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  - even people who are picky eaters and won' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  try  <START:Food> anything <END>  "non-american."

My wife brought me  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  on a Sunday.  The Pastrami was  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END> .  I believe this is one a a few different locations for Archies.  I'll be back......and I'll probably have the Pastrami again (that's how I  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ).

 <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  flies when you're having fun...It's been almost a full year since my initial review of  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END> , and I've been back probably ten times or more.I've seen a lot of transition with the  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  but I can say that their  <START:Service> service <END>  has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is right up my alley for a weekend  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , and my yogi  <START:F_FoodItem> omelette <END>  / protein  <START:F_FoodItem> pancake <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  have stayed  <START:Service> consistent <END>  too.  I was  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  earlier today and while the  <START:Service> service <END>  was spot-on, I did find a piece of  <START:F_FoodItem> ham <END>  in my otherwise  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelette <END>  - but I overlooked it and enjoyed my  <START:Food> meal <END>  nonetheless...My husband has been to  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled what's to come on their new  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  (think pastrami  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> ).  So, go for  <START:Food> breakfast <END> , go for  <START:Food> lunch <END> , go for a Bloody Mary or a  <START:F_Drinks> mimosa <END> ... just kick back and enjoy your  <START:Food> meal <END> !

I love their  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> ! Even though  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  serve cold Dolma it is still pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> . I also like their  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  with some artichokes. The  <START:W_Price> price <END>  is about $6.00 a pound but it is very filling and  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END> . This is a perfect  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat for someone who is broke but would still like to have a nutritious  <START:Food> meal <END> .

This area is severely lacking in sit down  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  choices, so this was nice to see a sit down  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  going into the old Nicks 24/7, especially because it seems to have taken them 1200 years to get this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  open...I had actually thought  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had pulled out it took so long.The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Size> large <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  are yum.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END>  are nice.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have this italian  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  which is absolutely divine!  I just wish the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  had more side choices.  You get a bland  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  or  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> zucchini <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  at  <START:Food> dinner <END>  which are nice when  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> , but if left too long before hitting the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are cold and floppy.  I have found the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  to be hit and miss.  Their tiramisu is totally delish!  And anyone that knows me knows, that if the tiramisu doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  impress I am hard pressed to come back.The  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  sways between  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  or absent, guess its just the luck of the draw.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are right, and if you sign up for their monthly newsletter you get some pretty nice bargains.

After arriving in Vegas off of an early morning flight, we wanted to find a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to grab some quick  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and where we could enjoy the beautifully hot and sunny weather.  We headed out from our hotel, Aria, and Cabo Wabo's  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  fit the bill.  The second floor  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  provided nice  <START:A_OutsideView> views <END>  of the Bellagio  <START:A_OutsideView> lake, <END> and the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!We started with some  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and queso which came with two  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  baskets of corn  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  was ok, the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was really runny, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were in  <START:F_FI_Size> tiny <END>  pieces which make dipping a challenge.For  <START:F_FoodItem> mains <END> , between us we had the Baja  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> , the jalapeno  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> , and the southwest cobb  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was a bit  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> overcooked <END>  and dry, but the overall  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavour <END>  was good and  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  featured  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  which was also a bit try, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  definitely weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  the best I'd ever had.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  looked great, and was a  <START:Ambience> huge <END>   <START:A_Places> portion <END> . <START:Restaurant> there <END>  definitely wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  any  <START:Food> food <END>  that would be  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  returning for.  The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  were a bit  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  for what we got, particularly the $15  <START:F_Dessert> banana <END>  mama  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  that was not that  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END> , but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way.I wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  return,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in Vegas with equally decent  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patios <END>  that I would try first.

Really good  <START:F_FI_Size> spice <END>  level.   <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  plates.  Pretty mundane po'boys.  Overly charred  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> .  Incredible  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> .Cramped indoor  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  but still good eats.  Don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  if you're vegetarian.

 <START:Food> meals <END>  were excellent!  Softshell po boy,  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> fried <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> oysters <END> , all wonderful! <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were good - the  <START:F_FoodItem> bananas foster <END>  were great!Friday night  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  - it was loud but very  <START:A_Environment> pleasant <END> .

I'm very picky when it comes to  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , but one thing I will say it's their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  delivery to my hotel room and  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were right on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I had their  original  <START:F_Ingredients> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were cut in squares no biggie, the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  greasy their a little more  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>  than  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  hut but it was all  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. You get what you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  for.

Met a friend  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and we were both well  <START:O_Experience> impressed <END> .  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and fast, so fast  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  also cleared my chai before I was done drinking it! <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  and well seasoned. Though you'd expect nothing less from this Italian 'chain'. I've been to La Favourita a few times, but this was my first visit to Vittoria and I wouldn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  hesitate to return.  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are reasonable for center of town and  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  weren' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  too bad, tho it was definitely a 2 course  <START:Food> lunch <END> . Think I would have left slightly hungry if I hadn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  had  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .

Okay so I have been to the  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in Hawaii and was happy to know that on my visits  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  in Vegas I can now satisfy my tastebuds again with more of "Thelmas Special"(crunchy luau style  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in thelmas  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ). This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has something for everyone. It combines a great value on their  <START:Food> entrees <END>  and even better is  <START:Service> served <END>  up by some of the  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendliest <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  who really make you feel  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END> ! Give em' a try!!!

Went to the Auld Hoose with a group of Yelpers in search of  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> .  Well, it wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  much of a search, we had previously been informed that this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has the biggest  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  ever - seriously see the  <START:A_Decor> pictures <END> !!  So I came armed with a hunger to match.  3 of us shared a bowl of these Mega  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  that are suggested for 3-4.   <START:S_Staff> they <END>  came pretty quickly and looked amazing when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  did.  Great ratio of  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END> , as so often  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is just not enough.  Chilli  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END> , sour  <START:F_Ingredients> cream <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  throughout.  It took us a good 20 minutes or so to make a serious dent in the mound and start to get to the underneath layers, which were still hot.  After eating about a quarter of the bowl myself, I really should have stopped, but as I hate wasting  <START:Food> food <END>  and the other 2 had had enough, I just kept shovelling it in....literally.....using the  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  to shovel up the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> .   <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>  mistake.  When I finally finished all the  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> , apart from some jalapeños which are a little on the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  side for my  <START:F_FoodItem> mild <END>  palate,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a only a handful of  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  left.  About 15 minutes later, when I got up to use the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> , I realised just how full I was - serious  <START:F_FoodItem> muffin <END>  top and struggled to do my pants back up.  Walking home was not at all comfortable, more of a waddle.  Then I seriously needed to lie down and stretch out.  I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  hesitate to say that these are the best  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  I've ever had.  I just wish we had a 4th person to help us eat the monstrosity.As for the pub; it is quite small, but with character.  Laid back  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , heavy  <START:A_Ent_Music> rock <END>  playing in the  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END> , not your usual pub  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> .  Would definitely go back for the  <START:F_FoodItem> nachos <END>  alone, but I might give it a while!

Great selection.  Lamb vindaloo is excellent.

If I could give 0 stars, I would. I used to visit the Paradise  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  until it closed due to salmonella. I figured this Westside  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  would be fine. My coworker and I went last night for  <START:Food> dinner <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  was absolutely terrible considering  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  were about a quarter full, but we dealt with it.Soon after we got home we were both experiencing terrible abdominal pains, followed by throwing up every  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  we ate. This went on for a few hours. Double  <START:Food> food <END>  poisoning? Disgusting. <START:S_Staff> they <END>  need to revamp their entire business. Kitchen,  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ,  <START:Service> service <END> . Firefly is headed down a bad road.

This is my favorite  <START:Food> buffet <END>  in vegas. I used to frequent the rio and m  <START:F_FoodItem> buffets <END>  for years, but ever since i tried this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , i'm never going back. Some of the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> served <END>  individually in small pots or  <START:Food> dishes <END>  which is nice since i have no  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  control. ALL of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  i tried that had starchy  <START:F_FoodItem> carbs <END>  were good. (i.e. the leek  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> !!!! this was ridiculous and the risotto) ONLY gripe was that the prime rib was over- <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  by my standards. The  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  was murder.... I think i ate like 40 chocolate covered  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END> . I swear  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  sprinkled a little bit of crack into each one.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  had oreo-covered marshmallows,  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberry <END>   <START:F_Dessert> shortcake <END> , and a bunch of little things of which i had no idea their names or what  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  consisted of. But most of it was pretty darn good. I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to go back in a couple weeks and GO TO TOWN on their  <START:Food> buffet <END> .

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was recommended by a friend when I moved to Las Vegas.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:Service> consistent <END> , and everyone I have brought  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  LOVES it!

 <START:F_Drinks> yummy <END>  locally  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roasted <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> . loved the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> iced <END>   <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  growler over the summer. just the basics, but  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> .

very  <START:F_Appetizer> disappointed <END> -went in just minutes before closing  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ... was just getting a "quick" sub &  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  to go.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was 1 other customer in shop. i parked in handicap  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  spot right in front. made my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  filled my  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . had a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  to wait for my sub (*because of my handicap) "shift mgr. graham" had stepped out to give that other customer something that was accidentally left out of his  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  as graham came back in he says "just so you know,  we're closed" then gave me an awkward look... then walked away... & i know he knew that i was dumbfounded by his comment because he kept awkwardly looking over at me - i hadn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even received my  <START:Food> food <END> - how did he know if i was or wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  planning to eat in shop or leave.  or was that just his way of saying get out...???  well when i did receive my  <START:Food> food <END>  i had asked for his name so i could call back the next day to speak to  <START:S_Staff> management <END> .  graham had the  <START:S_Staff> employee <END>  that who gave me his name, & he wasn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  aware that is good friend text my son to "apologize if he sounded disrespectful" not even 5 minutes after i left the shop... seems to me that graham was rethinking the way he was speaking to customers... ya think???

Fabulous  <START:Food> food <END> !!!!!  Great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> !!!  Fabulous customer  <START:Service> service <END> !!!!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was great will go again!!!  Have already told at least 10 other people to go try it out!!!  Fun little spot!!!!  Make sure to make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  as  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  get very busy!!!  The people working  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  where so helpful & kind & all had a beautiful smile!!!  Can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  wait to go again!!!

Superb  <START:Service> service <END> , excellent Deer  <START:F_FoodItem> carpaccio <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  and rich  <START:F_FoodItem> lamb shank <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly. Very satisfied  <START:Food> diner <END> .

I was going to be generous and give three stars but then I tried the peach cobbler. When I walked up to the podium to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  I asked if I could sample their BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . The man said he would bring out the house BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and some type of sweet BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I did not like either  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and this should have been an inclination of what was to come. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the two  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  plate with pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and for my side I chose the baked  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  <START:S_Del_Time> 10 minutes <END>  later my  <START:Food> food <END>  was ready. First, I tried the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  and the pulled  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and both were less then impressive. I used some BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  that I had at home to spruce up the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> . Next, I tried the baked  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were good, I liked the chunks of  <START:F_FoodItem> brisket <END>  and I think their house BBQ  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  better when it is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  into something. Lastly, the peach cobbler was inedible. I took one  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  and that was it, all I could  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was nutmeg. Still in search of good BBQ in Las Vegas and that includes the sides as well.

Super  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  Tuesdays and Thursdays. I had always preferred traditional  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  (Tuesday) over boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  (Thursday). Personally the boneless  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  somehow do not feel like I'm having  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> . Despite being easier to eat, I would like my  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to be messy, but that is just me =)I have tried a  <START:Ambience> huge <END>  variety from the non  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  Sweet BBQ  to the extremely  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  Wild. Some favorites are Parmesan and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> , Honey BBQ, Asian Zing and Mango Habanero.The  <START:F_FoodItem> wing <END>  Tuesdays is the only reason for showing up. It's a great way to get  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .

I've been wanting to try this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but since the other ramen  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had overly  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END>  broth the last two times, I got turned off eating ramen all together.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a odd day of constant rain and cool temps in this blister which needed to be celebrated with some  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . Made for a perfect excuse to have something warming.I grabbed up a  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  ramen and the BF went for  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  ramen and on the recommendation of the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  for a "lighter" broth got shoyu base. The  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> savory <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> buttery <END>  (has some oil floaties, but enough to be a deterrent) and not overtly  <START:F_Ingredients>   salt  . <END> . I really like that it comes with a soft  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> boiled <END>  soy  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> , the thicker rustic  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> roast <END>  style cut of chashu was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> tender <END>  and the ramen was rightfully chewy. This is a bit different from the traditional Sapporo  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  I'm used to as it normally has corn,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts,  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END> . I suppose I could add those  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I took a  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of the BFs shoyu  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  broth and it was fairly good. Still a bit porky, but much lighter since it isn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  creamy like the  <START:F_FoodItem> miso <END>  and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> spicy <END>  crept up to a  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burn <END> . We got a mini chashu bowl to share. It was much smokier than the chashu in the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  so it seems  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  throw it on the grill before serving and top with a drizzle of sweet soy so it's a different  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . I like this preparation. I wish  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  offer some  <START:F_Ingredients> vinegar <END>  as a side condiment as the little bit of acid would be nice with the sweet. We came within the last hour of being open so I figured that's why  <START:Service> service <END>  is quick, but hope that it  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  comes out that fast regularly. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  make us feel rushed. I definitely prefer this over the other ramen  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Somehow my BF got it in his head he doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  like ramen so even though I like it, it may be a trek I make again alone.

I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best  <START:Food> food <END>  overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> ). If this is your first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  trying Postino, you MUST try the  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> . It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are trying to copy Postino's  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , but it is never as good. Aside from the  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. Most importantly, the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> really nice <END>  also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have their special - any bottle of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  AND a tray of  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> ! It cannot be beat!!

Hands down, the best sisig we've  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  in the US.  <START:Service> service <END>  sucked though. Took a really long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for us to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  (although  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were a few empty  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> ),  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  took an even longer  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to come back to get our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and we were already halfway done with our  <START:Food> meal <END>  when the sisig came out. The  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  beside us who came in later than us got their sisig way ahead of us so maybe  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  forgot our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . Good thing the sisig was  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the wait! Will definitely go back for that.

I'll keep it simple. This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  sits right under Five Guys and In-N-Out on my list of favorite fast ( <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> )  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  joints... It's a great  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , very  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> ... but you don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  have as many options and the  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even compare to Five Guys. I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>  and swiss char... that's basically the extent of their  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  options... and I thoroughly enjoyed it! But the whole  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was thinking I wish this  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  had  <START:F_Ingredients> bacon <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  jalapenos on it!!Nice  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but given the choice I'm going across the street...

Normally I don' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  give 2 star's but I am going to give this over hyped  <START:Food> buffet <END>  one for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  being that I'm a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  lover and have  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in tons of them to compare to.First off this is as I seen one if not the most  <START:W_Price> expensive <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END> 's in town right now with myself  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  $48 to get in even with a player's card.2nd off I have no clue how  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  got 500  <START:Food> dishes <END>  out of the mixture  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no way by far 500  <START:Food> dishes <END>  in this  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is the same amount of selection from stateion to station as any other typical  <START:F_FI_Size> big <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  in Vegas maybe  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  trying to hype up the fact you can CUSTOMIZE a  <START:Food> dish <END>  up to 500 ways but either way I'm not buying it because I was expecting to see once again THE KING OF  <START:Food> buffet <END> 'S  <START:Restaurant> here <END> !Let's say the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  was very poor, the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  in some  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  in a bag, the Italian  <START:Food> food <END>  was very bland nothing interesting or unique especially the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  balls  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> frozen <END>  freezer selection.  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  didn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  even serve  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  so I had to settle on  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  chops also that were very  <START:W_Price> cheap <END>  in  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .. just the list goes on and on of just miss after miss of trying to hit the spot on  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and selection.The only positive thing I can say about this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is that my greeter was very nice and gave me a quick tour of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was a very nice gentleman which I tipped him accordingly but other then that I'll never return.

Hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  is very good.

 <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  my husband and I love it.  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is really  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great.

Absolutely love this  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !!! So pleased that it arrived in the Surprise area! This  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  has great  <START:S_Staff> employees <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  and if  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  ever do make a mistake (which has happened only once in the 100+ times I've been  <START:Restaurant> there <END> )  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  are very quick to make sure that you are  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and properly taken care of! Love me some Freddy's!

Had early Friday night pre-theater  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Once we got a  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> 's attention the  <START:Service> service <END>  was very good.  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> attentive <END>  with good suggestions but not intrusive. Casual open  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>   <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , causal but lively ambience, perfect for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  with friends. My wife & her friend enjoyed a "prickly pear  <START:F_Drinks> margarita <END> " not too sweet very  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> !  Excellent  <START:Food> food <END>  overall  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> . Guac was  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END>  & paired well with the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . We had 3  <START:Food> dishes <END>  perfect for sharing. Mexican street corn nicely  <START:F_Ingredients> spiced <END>  a bit messy but  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it. Nice  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  updated take on classic fare. Will certainly go back!

This  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in town and Chu is hella cutie . Ron is great and all the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff>   chef  . <END>  are  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  . I try to come all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> 

We were excited to have a  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  joint in the area - but unfortunately we will not be  <START:F_FI_Size> regulars <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is extremely  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  - opening the door as we walked in and a  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  taking our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  immediately - but the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  cannot make up for the sub par  <START:Food> food <END> .  We had  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  that was over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  - followed by my husbands  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  that to me looked canned - and he said did not  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  much better - not to mention the double corn tortillas could not even stay together.  Move on to my  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>  mahi  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  that somehow was extreme greasy. I also had a side of plantains that were more like  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> burnt <END>  sautéed bananas than plantains - though my husbands  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  were good.  So we may be back for a  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  - but not  <START:Food> food <END> .Oh and one last note - the  <START:A_Decor> decorations <END>  are very beachish - but the  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  was not - it should have been old beach  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  - Beach Boys, Steel Drums, Bob Marley etc...

This is a review from a  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  lover. Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a bday party and this  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  does not serve  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  /  <START:F_Drinks> liquor <END> , only a few  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> . Just writing this as an FYI to anyone expecting a variety of  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  choices. Not a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  person....? Go somewhere else.

Oh man, first of all I am soooo happy  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is finally a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like this in the east valley. Second, it's amazing! The  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is super cute and  <START:O_Experience> welcoming <END> , the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END>  and helpful, and the  <START:Food> food <END> ... Holy  <START:F_FoodItem> crap <END> , yum! So far, the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  duo and the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  are both incredible. I'll definitely be back to try more since pretty much everything on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  sounds  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . Oh and if you like peanut  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  & jelly  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  have an  <START:F_Appetizer> awesome <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cupcake <END> !

 <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> grilled <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  is where it's at! love these  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> . I've tried them all

3.5 stars for  <START:Food> food <END> . I really enjoyed the shawarma. It was very flavorful.  The dolmades was good too. It has the right acidity on it. The  <START:F_FoodItem> gyro <END> , however, was dry and lacking  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  feta  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END>  lacks  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and it  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like an old refried  <START:F_Appetizer> fries <END> . If it's not then it was way over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> .  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> 3 stars <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> : we  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $26.10 for 2 combo  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  wrap with one side each. FYI their combo doesn' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  come with  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . You would assume for the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  it does.

I'm so rarely on the early end of a  <START:A_Decor> trendy <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  that I feel pretty cool having visited The Summit Room just a month after  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  opened! It looks totally different than when it was Bruegger's - I can' <START:S_Staff> t <END>  speak to the Mayobird side, but I definitely felt like I was in a casual,  <START:A_Decor> trendy <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . A girlfriend and I went after work and got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  right at 5:00 when  <START:S_Staff> they <END>  opened. We were only the second people in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> , and we grabbed a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  itself is awfully pretty... glass bottles as far as the eye can see and silver  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:A_Furniture> stools <END>  lend themselves to a very clean, modern feel without being sterile.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were maybe 12-14  <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , a few  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  along the side, and a high, long  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at the front near the front door.  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's also a  <START:Ambience> huge <END> , inviting  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END> , but it was a little sweltering the night we were  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . I also love the  <START:Ambience> huge <END> , private  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  lot, which is a little rare on East Blvd.Our  <START:S_Staff> bartender <END> , Scott, was so fun and gave us honest recommendations on what to get. I think he got a little overwhelmed later in the evening, but I'm guessing  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're just getting their footing. We opted to split the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flat  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  flat  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  came in four pieces, which were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  if just a smidgen dry, and the BBQ  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was pretty  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> , too. It came over a corn  <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> , which  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  verrrry corny, so buyer beware. We were also given complimentary cheddar scones before  <START:Food> dinner <END> , which  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like the  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  Red  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  cheddar bay biscuits, only in  <START:A_Decor> light <END>  scone form... mmmmm.We each got a signature  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END> ;  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are 7, and  <START:S_Staff> they <END> 're named after the tallest summit on each continent. The Mount Vinson was very smooth - cinnamon, ginger  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , vanilla - and The Kilimanjaro was refreshing and sweet for summer -  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END> , cranberry, gin.When we left, we noticed that the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  was packed! This is a great " <START:A_Environment> classy <END> " addition to a casual row of  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  on East Blvd. Do yourself a favor, and check out The Summit Room.

Nice new chain all u can eat  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Tokyo, <START:Service> service <END>  are fast and  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> friendly <END> , <START:Food> food <END>  are almost  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasty <END> ,especially the raw  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END>  which was sweet and  <START:F_Drinks> yummy <END> !One downside is the mussel  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we had last night were not so  <START:F_FI_Quality> fresh <END> .The  <START:A_Decor> decoration <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is cool, I like the fancy chandelier ,maybe that's the reason it's a little  <START:W_Price> pricey <END>  for a AYCE  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .One more thing,do avoid general Tao kinda of  <START:Food> dish <END>  ,that was just ridiculous

The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I have ever asked my  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  to get me the  <START:S_Menu> recipe <END>  for a  <START:Food> dish <END> ! The Carolina coastal catch is hands down one of the best  <START:Food> dishes <END>  I've ever had. Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to celebrate our anniversary!
The  <START:S_Staff> guy <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  helped me was very nice. However for $7 I expect  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  out of my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which wasn't  <START:Opinion> bad <END> , but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't great. Honestly I could get a better, less expensive  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  at  <START:F_FoodItem> sub <END>  station two or Harris teeter.
I love  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> !  Huge  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  All very tempting, but from the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we visited we tried the  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  Benedict and have been hooked ever since!!The Hollandaise  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is the best I've had ever - anywhere!  And the  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  come with  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  are to die for!!  I don't know how  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are thin, crisp, potatoey and very onioney.  I love  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> !!   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only makes me sad  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I live in Durham and only get to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  about once a year.I did switch once and try the Dutch Baby, which was big and lovely and tasty with all the powdered  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> lemony <END> , but I really missed my  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END>  bennie and  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  and have never looked back.  Oh, you must try  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and btw, get the  <START:F_FoodItem>   sour     cream   <END>  and applesauce for the tater  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END> .
Ever just want excellent Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  for your party, just like Mama used to make but without the  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END>  of preparation and cooking?  We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  from Comedor's catering  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> :  green  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> flautas <END>  (substitution of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  for our Halloween party.  Surprisingly, Comedor also included a quart  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem>   sour     cream   <END>  and two big bags of tortilla  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> .   <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  were extremely reasonable and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing!  I'm not a big green  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  fan but I am now!  Chunks of fresh green  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  and boy, were the  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  plump full of  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> !  I've decided  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I'll never slave over a  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  stove to prep for a party or get together.  El Comedor's catering  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  saved me tons of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and headache AND  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was extremely affordable.  I got to enjoy our party and everyone couldn't say enough great  <START:Food> things <END>  about the  <START:Food> food <END> !
The  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are good and the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  are friendly.  I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are open until 7pm, while most of the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> shops <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  much earlier.  The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are kind of steep for what the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END>  are so I marked a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  down. I had the d.a.m.  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and the  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> .  are good.  The  <START:F_Ingredients> coleslaw <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  fresh!  My husband had the bangers  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Price> 9 bucks <END> .  I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have the  <START:F_FoodItem> pickles <END>  in individual baggies so the  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END>  crowd can just grab and go. Also,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  sell  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:Service> treats <END> .  So  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's good.
I work in central Phoenix and have heard good  <START:Food> things <END>  about the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . Finally got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with a friend and we both found the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  to have many  <START:Food> items <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we would love to try. I decided to have the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  open faced and seared which is perfect.  Was seasoned deliciously and accompanied by a fresh side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  We had a friendly  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , Meggie who was polite enough to write down the name of  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  we  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .  I will be back...soon.
I give Cooperstown a five  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  - based on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  alone.  I ate  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with 2 kids and our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  was $30 with tip.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is nothing fancy - just  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and refreshing on a hot day.  The girls said  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  fingers and mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was good and I really enjoyed the Ty Cobb  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  Also, love the giant glasses of iced  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> .  The  <START:Service> service <END>  was attentive and quick for being so busy.  Neat  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to go overall.
Great  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  at a very reasonable  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> !
I used to be scared...I used to be petrified.  I was never one to branch out with my  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , which meant  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I never had Indian  <START:Food> food <END>  before...until a couple of months ago when I was invited to a  <START:Food> dinner <END>  party. And at  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> .  of India...my Indian  <START:Food> food <END>  cherry was broken.I decided to review  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  now...since I have experienced other  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  since.  I tend to always come back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END> .  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  seems very clean, I love the Bollywood videos  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  play, and I love the  <START:Service> service <END> .  And I think  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have the best  <START:Food> buffet <END> !  Now, I am really  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  at names of the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  (which is why I end up at the  <START:Food> buffet <END> ...I may not know the names, but I know what I like looks like)See me  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  at  <START:Food> lunch <END>  real soon :)
I have eaten  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  several times only because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  right around the corner from my house. The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  was good the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we ate  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and has been down hill ever since.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like the prepackaged  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  you find at the store and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are so small. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a philly  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and a california  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and all you can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was the  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END> . Totally disappointed.
mmmm New Mexico style mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  in Arizona! We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a number of  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  and shared to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  a combo of  <START:Food> things <END> :  The Chile con (green) Carne & The Chile Relleno were my favorite!  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END>  and Chimichanga were just good. Our favorite was the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_Dessert> sopapillas <END>  (w red  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> ) and shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gorditas <END> . You can't find authentic  <START:F_FoodItem> gorditas <END>  anywhere but Texas and NM, so what a  <START:Service> treat <END> ! Si Senor is very generous in  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  complimentary  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  w 4 different  <START:F_FoodItem> salsas <END>  when you arrive then  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Dessert> sopapillas <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . ( <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  might charge for a 2nd  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  though -not sure, never had to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  -ask your  <START:S_Staff> server <END> ). Only negative I can express would be  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't have the soap filled in the men's  <START:A_Plc_RestRoom> restroom <END>  (per my husband ;)
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  little hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  packs some big  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . We came to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  family-owned  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  to celebrate our friends' engagement.   they  are regulars and said we'd love the  <START:Food> food <END> ;  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were right.  We were greeted warmly and informed  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  would take a bit  <START:S_Del_Time> longer <END>  due to a large catering  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  was also cooking.  No matter since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't seem like much of a delay at all.  We enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> ,  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , and conversation before our  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> courses <END>   <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END> .  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> marsala <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a generous helping of three pieces of moist  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  with a very tasty  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and lots of  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> ; I highly recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> dish <END> !  Believe  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  or not, I didn't have any  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> , but my friend's  <START:F_FoodItem> spaghetti <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END>  looked  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  I love little hole-in-the- <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  places like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  over a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  any day. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is friendly and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is good.PS-our friends are having Buon Gusto cater  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  wedding reception, which means I get  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> marsala <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> tonight <END> --grazie!
Thank god for newer reviews... I should have listened to  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> !!!Been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few times before back in like 2003-2004  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  frame. Remember the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  to be much better back then. Was in town visiting and wanted to return to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  again. Yes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the same old  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  but the  <START:Food> food <END>  was pretty crappy.  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  HORRIBLE and these  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  working  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  lack major personality.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was constant confusion as to if we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  or not, what we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , and so forth. The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was actually a bit rude I thought constantly rushing us and reaching across me constantly to take  <START:S_Cutlery> silverware <END>  and  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  from other side of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> , and at 2  <START:S_Del_Time> minute <END>  intervals???Will not return. Seriously if you are pissed to do  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  type of work then get a new job. If you run a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  you better be a little personable.
I haven't lived in Pittsburgh for 4 years, and even now after all  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , on a Thursday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  I wish I was still lived in Oakland so a few friends and I could hit up Fuel for some  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> . Fuel is the best  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in Oakland at  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> , particularly if your over 21.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a little  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END>  but the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  (100 different  <START:S_Menu> varieties <END> ) is the best virtually anywhere. The  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  starts at 11, so you can go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  get  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  with some friends and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a good  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  is always excellent, and after 11 a good value. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is always good. I love the  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but I could see how  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  could find  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  irritating.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's loud (particularly when  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END> ) and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is  <START:A_Env_Type> crowded <END> . However in my four years going to fuel  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  never once dissuaded me, because the  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is just too good and trying the new  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  is just too much fun.
Ahhhh the Melting Pot. Where do I begin... <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is a little slice of heaven. The Melting Pot is great for a girls get together and  <START:Food> anything <END>  in between. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  and  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:Food> fondues <END>  are my favorite.
I'm always on the lookout for your basic  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and 2/3  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  so when I saw La'Wan's in a strip shopping center on South Tryon, I thought I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a try. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was immediate and attentive.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a  <START:Food> buffet <END>  and a  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  from which to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . I chose the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  because I wanted some  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetables <END> . Although the  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fine, the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  is very limited in  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> :  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> , fried  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and a couple of other  <START:S_Menu> choices <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would have been OK except  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  charged over $9.00 for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . If I go back, I should probably choose from the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
My girlfriend's family was visiting from Milwaukee.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  wanted to go out for a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  would be suitable for Grandpa and a celiac diet.  We decided on the Stable Grill.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the perfect choice.Before  <START:Food> dinner <END>  we all had a few of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  famous old fashioneds.  Korbel is  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  rail  <START:F_Drinks> brandy <END>  so you know  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are going to be good.   <START:S_Staff> her <END>  dad loved the  <START:F_FoodItem> meatloaf <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had a  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  raved about.  I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> ribs <END>  which were solid.   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came with these  <START:F_Ingredients> buttered <END>  red  <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were simple but  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .  My GF had the  <START:F_FoodItem> perch <END>  which  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  thought were some of the best  <START:S_Staff> she <END> 's had.The Stable's  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  is quite remarkable.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is basically an old stable fitted with a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and  <START:A_Plc_Bar> dining   room   <END> .  Old wood  <START:A_Places> floor <END> , rock  <START:A_Decor> walls <END> , a huge barn  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END>  and rickety stairs leading to a second  <START:A_Places> floor <END> . A lot of trendy places aim for the kind of  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  the stable offers but you cant duplicate authenticity.All in all  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a supper club style dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  in a cool old  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  setting.  If you are looking to try something off the beaten path and are tired of  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , trendy  <START:Food> aiolis <END> , beet  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END>  or whatever the latest foodie  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> is  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  week, the Stable Grill at Quiveys Grove is just right.
Sows of all ethnicities are  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  at China One!China One is a  <START:F_FI_Size> massive <END>  Mongolian-Chinese  <START:Food> buffet <END> . The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is never too full, in a great  <START:Restaurant> location <END> , features reasonable  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  and most of the offerings tempt repeatedly.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a couple of issues, though. The  <START:Service> service <END>  is pedestrian and too carefree; the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  are space cadets and rarely present timely.  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  plenty of fluids ... then  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  ... the  <START:Food> food <END>  is liberally laced of  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  MSG. As expected, the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  is old and a  <START:F_FI_Healthy> health <END>  risk with  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  swallow greatly increases.The review reads a little negative, but China One is a sensational guilty pleasure for its  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END> . If you see me at the  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END> , though ... step aside and give respects.
I've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  about 5 times total, and I am completely unimpressed. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is overpriced and just not  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I have no problem  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for a good  <START:Food> meal <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  wasn't a good  <START:Food> meal <END> . I could have made what ended up on my  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  from the contents of my refrigerator and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would have  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  better. The one caveat to my "My Florist has crappy  <START:Food> food <END> " attitude is the  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>  scones. These are absolute heaven. Too  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  I won't be back for  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> , as getting one means dealing with the rude  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . Out of the five visits, only once was the  <START:Service> service <END>  decent, and I think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was only because my dining companion knew the  <START:S_Staff> server <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's  <START:Opinion> bad <END> . I never went in dressed like a bum or  <START:Service> treated <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  obnoxiously, but yet the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  had no problem  <START:Service> treating <END>  me like a second class citizen who didn't belong in the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . I don't know what kind of qualifications you have to have to get decent  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but I obviously don't have  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> . I won't be back ever.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a shame, too, because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is within walking distance.
Va Dang is pretty darn  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I prefer Pho Thanh, but thats my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . I like the  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END>  better at Pho Thanh, however Va Dang has way better  <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  available.
Funky strip mall like  <START:Restaurant> location <END>  but great  <START:Food> food <END> . Got some free  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , I was stoked. Great  <START:F_Appetizer> tapas <END>  to share, good for light eaters or to hold over a drunken hunger with out making you sick. Just say no to a  <START:Food> buffet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  will not be pretty, stick with FireFly for great  <START:F_Appetizer> tapas <END> !
Best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in the valley!  Not only is  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  in my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END> ; which makes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  great,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  around. Never too long of a  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  and always  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . Competitive  <START:F_FI_Price> pricing <END>  and large  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> . Its nice to go back and get the same  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
We've been dying to visit  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for years! Why did we  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for so long??? On countless occasions, we've heard nightmare stories of  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  in  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  for three  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  or  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> .   <START:S_Staff> people <END>  seem to rave about the authentic and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>  style  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We had to have a two  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  break on a weekday.  We took a gamble to see if we would be able to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  within a reasonable amount of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and finally check  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  off our list. To our surprise we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  within 30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and had our  <START:Food> food <END>  brought out within 15-20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> . We had the ' <START:F_FoodItem> caprese <END> '  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  and the biancoverde  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>  added and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was INCREDIBLE!!! The  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  was fresh and tasty and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  reminded us of great  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in Italy! BEST  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  in the Phoenix metropolitan area! Note  <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>   <START:Food> food <END> , but probably would not  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  3+  <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END>  for  <START:Food> dinner <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a wonderful  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for  <START:Food> lunch <END> --if you have a  <START:S_Del_Time> longer <END>  break!Note: The website states, " <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  accepted for parties of 6-10 when possible."
I don't go in enough for the morning  <START:S_Staff> barista <END>  to know my name, but  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  always phrases  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  as, "I'm sorry, I should know  <START:Restaurant> this <END> , what is your name again?" and I find  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:A_Env_Type> charming <END> .  The homemade whipped  <START:Food> cream <END>  is almost impossible to resist - and if you're going to do  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  then you might as well have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  be resting upon a large Velvet Mocha - one of the best  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  in Phoenix.  I feel like I should bring my Powerbook  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  - and I even find myself counting how many non-mac users dare to crack open  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  cases.  Still,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a fun little  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  with friendly  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and fabulous hot  <START:F_Drinks> beverages <END> . Bring an out of town SF or NY hipster who refuses to believe  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is ANY culture in Phoenix.
Since we didn't hit Craftsteak on our last trip to Vegas, I made a point to eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . No  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  now  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  my husband and I have lost 120lbs together and are just eating differently. So, we were a tad  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  conservative, but still splurged and left with our bellies full. We split the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bisque <END>  to start, which was good, but cannot compare to Kokomo's (which is now  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  to make  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for Tom's Heritage  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  BOO). I didn't like the large pieces of  <START:Food> tarragon <END>  on top, which feels like chewing on pieces of grass, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was tolerable. The  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  was nice and tender.For  <START:Food> dinner <END>  we split the  <START:F_FoodItem> 10oz   filet   <END> , the  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> puree <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was still so much  <START:Food> food <END> ! The  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>  was made with  <START:F_Ingredients> butternut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> prosciutto <END>  and was so rich and creamy and really wonderful. I know  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is what properly made  <START:F_FoodItem> risotto <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like and how easy  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  can be to get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wrong.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> puree <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END>  were absolute heaven.For  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_Ingredients> pumpkin <END>   <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  and I was pretty disappointed.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a small circle of mushy  <START:F_Ingredients> pumpkin <END>  with a vanilla  <START:Food> cream <END>  of some kind on top of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . I hate to say  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , but  <START:F_Dessert> cheesecake <END>  Factory  <START:F_Dessert> cheescake <END>  was better than  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  stuff. Major bummer, thus the deletion of a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END> . When you  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  $15 for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  at a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  like  <START:Restaurant> this <END> , you want to shove your face  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  in and eat 15 of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> , not just pick at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and wish  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  like at a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  where you hate  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
Mediocre at best.. went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was in NY/NY and we were staying  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  Hungry and in the mood for  <START:Food> italian <END>  we went in...  <START:Service> service <END>  was good, the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  was awesome.. <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  dry, and without much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> ...  The  <START:F_FoodItem> swordfish <END>  was pretty good but again not much  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .. keep in mind we had just  <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  in Vegas and were hungry and tired and excited and didn't have any  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>  in our system... to me  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I would eat and enjoy just about  <START:Food> anything <END> !!...  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was still mediocre at best..  Wouldn't recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and definitely not going to eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again.
Nice  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  good  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  even have a little  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  i also like  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  too all around a good  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat!
Always  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and great  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> ! We enjoyed another wonderful  <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  just last  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was sooo  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to getting 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . However, one thing changed my mind. I had a  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  in the  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hours <END> , and I was on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and on my  <START:O_Reservation> reservation <END>  notes, I proposed a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't ready when I got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  so we had to take a timer and stand around.30  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  later we got the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was facing  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  which was a good  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the only reason  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't get 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . The  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  took way to long to get and even when I put  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  for in advance.The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was nice and quick, and explained the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  just right. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was amazing! I love  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  and decided to go with  <START:F_FoodItem> lasagna <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was hot and fresh  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasting <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't a loud  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and was very clean. I wil love to come back to try something else on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .
 <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's taken me forever to get to Chelsea's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> , a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I've been wanting to try for years! I went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:Restaurant> this <END>  past weekend and was so happy to finally head to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  beautiful  <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  has a breezy island vibe with sprawling  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patios <END>  both at the front of the house and back. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's no wonder the spot was bustling when I went for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at 9 p.m. on a Friday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  -- the mixed crowd of all ages packed the house, which had cozy  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  and striking printed  <START:A_Decor> curtains <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  make guests feel right at home, no matter the crowd. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  contained a few  <START:A_Ent_Tv> televisions <END>  with  <START:A_Entertainment> sporting <END>  events on, so you could  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  in any type of  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  you wanted -- cozy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> dining   room   <END> , spacious  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  or at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .Our  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were professional and attentive, and the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was fantastic and hugely portioned -- I took  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>  of mine home. I loved the Lucy's "Spiked"  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  ($8)  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktail <END>  I got, with  <START:F_Drinks> vodka <END> ,  <START:F_Drinks> lemonade <END>  and fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> rosemary <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was refreshing and strong and didn't have a gross  <START:F_Drinks> alcohol <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  --  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was easy to  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and tasty.We started with the  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  ($10), which is pretty much a must-try since all the  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END> , including the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END> , are all made in-house. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  had the perfect amount of spiciness (maybe a 7 out of 10), and the  <START:F_FoodItem> guacamole <END>  would have been great to eat on its own.For my  <START:Food> meal <END> , I tried the Shangri-La Vegetarian  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  ($12), which consisted of  <START:F_Ingredients> grains <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> nuts <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> seeds <END> . I usually don't get French  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , but I did  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had really great seasoning and the perfect amount of  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was tasty, but the consistency made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  difficult to hold together. Not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  matters --  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a great  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was really filling.Chelsea's biggest impression on me was the  <START:Service> service <END>  of the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> , who made you feel  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  and valued from start to finish.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's no wonder  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  remain so loyal to the  <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  --  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems like a wonderful  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for anyone to have a great  <START:Food> meal <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review is just specific to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Service> service <END> . I took my mom to  <START:Food> lunch <END>  after a busy morning of shopping at the mall. We were greeted right away and asked which we would prefer, a  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  or a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . I love when  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  give you a choice if either are available. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was very  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> , friendly and knowledgeable about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Mom and I both had  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Cob was so yummy! I almost ate  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  all and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a good  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END> ! The only downside to the  <START:Food> meal <END>  was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  charged me 3.25 for an unsweetened  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> . What??! I should have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  house  <START:F_Ingredients> chardonnay <END>  for a few bucks  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END> .. Oh well.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  else was wonderful and I'll certainly return for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  again soon.
So I have been a customer at Ticoz from literally day one.  I have been through the change in ownership and I have to say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the current  <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , Joe, is so terrific!   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  comes over and chats with us and is always so awesome and down to earth!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is even better lately (if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's possible) and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  always go the extra mile to make your dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  terrific.    I'm not someone who has been to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and is reviewing  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ......I am not a  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  spokesperson!  Just a very satisfied customer.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a hidden gem in Las Vegas. The  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  is right in the middle of the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>  at Palace Station. I was expecting an actual  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , not a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with 20  <START:A_Furniture> chairs <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a long  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to sit down so I figured  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was definitely  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> . Luckily, I was with other  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  so I played Roulette while we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> . Once  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  take your  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  very calmly.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do not rush you considering  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a  <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  to eat. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in steam pots instead of a gas burner.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> oyster bloody mary shooters <END>  and the Pan roast at level 7 hot..  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is soo good I would recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to anyone...
Margherita Doc  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , some of the best I've had, and we had GREAT  <START:Service> service <END> !!! Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  Natalia was fantastic and very informative...great first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  :)
You get a lot of  <START:Food> food <END> . But  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  is poor and  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are high.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is overrated and  <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  too high!!!
My favorite Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in town. I think Taqueria Guadalajara has better  <START:Food> food <END>  in general, but I prefer El Pastor. The  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  are just as good and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is easier to get to and always easy to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END> ; and the  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END>  are fantastic! The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very welcoming, making  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  easy to come back regularly.If you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  one of the  <START:Food> meals <END> , get an extra  <START:F_FoodItem> taco <END>  a la carte.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are too good to come in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and not have at least one.
Very Disappointing is an understatement! Good China boasts on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  website  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were the 2007 recipients of New York's Top 100 Chinese/Asian Fusion Award, and all I can say is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  may have been so in 2007. However, Good China fails to live up to  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  reputation, today, 7-years later. My family has recently moved back to the United States from living in Singapore for the last 4-years, and we are originally from New York. So, we have a little knowledge in authentic Chinese  <START:Food> food <END>  and Americanized New York Chinese  <START:Food> food <END> --and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  eating  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  really fell short.Starting with the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> , we had "Spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> ", and for those of you New Yorkers, most  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  have flavorful " <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> "  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  are stuffed with a combination of  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> cabbage <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> carrots <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bean <END>  sprouts, and Asian  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> . What we received were  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  saturated "Spring  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> ". Because  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were so oily, each  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  oozed  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> , canceling out any  <START:F_Ingredients>     flavor <END> . from the  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetables <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> spices <END>  used. We could have literally squeezed out enough  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  to reuse. We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the " <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  Puffs", which many Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , including many in Singapore call " <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  Rangoon"--a type of dim sum.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was very little filling used inside the wrappers, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seemed  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  someone might have been heavy handed with  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> , because  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were incredibly  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  instead of savory. You could not even  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  any  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  (and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  may have used imitation  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END>  from the looks of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ), nor could you  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  the  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had been turned into a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>   <START:Food> cream <END>  due to the over use of something  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  as a flavoring.What can I say about the "War Wonton  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> "? The proper name for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  is "Wor Wonton  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ", but what we had was "Slime  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> ". The wontons had been so over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  melted off the filling, producing an off-putting slimy  <START:Food> texture <END> . However, the  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END>  was okay--a bit on the salty side.Next, the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  we tried. We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  "House Lo Mein". Obviously,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use Fettuccini  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  instead of authentic Chinese  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  too was on the salty side and the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  was over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> --not at all tender. We also had " <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Young" ( <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Yong), which were flat and  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> -like in  <START:Food> texture <END> --nothing like  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Young.  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  Foo Young is, simply put, an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> . Well,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is in Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in New York and Singapore. How can you mess up an  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> omelet <END> ? Oh, you can make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  the consistency of  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> ! The  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use on top of  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems to be the same brown salty  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  used on other  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we had like the " <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ". " <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ", in  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  we have ever eaten  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , is usually a light garlicky  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> --not a brown salty  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with no hint of  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .The "Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ", we are still not sure if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was actually  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  inside the heavily  <START:F_Ingredients> battered <END>  nuggets--the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  was hard and over  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  also  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  like someone had poured a whole bottle of honey over the nuggets--no sesame  <START:F_Ingredients> seeds <END>  in sight. In addition, if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  could not get worse, when you looked in the container of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  supposed "Sesame  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ",  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  spooned in all the burnt residual  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  sits within the  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  used for frying--meaning  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are not periodically cleaning and changing the  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  between  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> --gross!On the plus side, the "House Fried  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> " was descent,  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  was good, and the  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  looked clean. Overall, even though the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  are average, you are overpaying for poor  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> food <END> .
A few years ago, I would have given  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END>  a 5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  review but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has gone downhill since then.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  used to give  <START:Offers> discounts <END>  if you only got a few  <START:Food> things <END>  in your  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have continually raised  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  while giving  <START:A_Env_Size> smaller <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END> . I'm pretty sure  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  use  <START:A_Env_Size> smaller <END>  spoons. And I get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are a corporation and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the decisions aren't always up to  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> , but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is no denying the value has gone down hill.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's still good  <START:Food> food <END> , but not  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> 9  dollars <END>  a person.
Very nice! Cugino's is one of the few true  <START:Food> italian <END>  delis in town, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  have a good assortment of what  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  from back East are used finding.Yes,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are plenty of popular favorites  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we all know:  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> subs <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> parmigiana <END> , etc., and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are also some  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> foods <END>  you might not be familiar with.I have an "old world"  <START:Food> italian <END>  heritage thanks to my mom.  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  St. Joseph's day,  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made  <START:F_FoodItem> arancini <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  Easter  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  made a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzagiana <END> . When I first found Cugino's I was floored!  <START:F_FoodItem> arancini <END>  readily available! Mortadella in the deli case! Checkerboard  <START:F_Appetizer> cookies <END>  by the dozen! Frozen  <START:F_FoodItem> sfogliatelli <END>  to take home and bake!If you've been looking for  <START:Food> food <END>  like Nonna used to make, or you're feeling a little adventurous, or you just want some good  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  by the slice, head to the University district and give Cugino's a try.
CHECK YOUR  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  BEFORE LEAVING!!! I'm not one to complain or even care much when my  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  is messed up; as I work in the  <START:Food> food <END>  industry, and understand  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  shot happens.. But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's happened  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  than 3 times now, at around 12 am- (not a busy  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ) Just make sure you get what your  <START:O_Payment> paying <END>  for,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not fun to get home and not have someone's  <START:Food> meal <END> .
A  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  has to earn my respect. First pass is a quick look-through of the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  in the display. I try to be unobtrusive about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so I don't look like a tourist, but if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's stacked up and already cut, or if I see a big vat-o'-spicy- <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> -with-mayo, or a  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> microwave <END>  on the back counter, I'll just flee, or I'll  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  California  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .Second pass is to throw down the gauntlet to the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END> . A triple-whammy  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END> , fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> salmon <END>  and yellowtail  <START:F_FoodItem> sashimi <END> . Typically  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  will  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  between $30 and $40, so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  had better be the goddam best the  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  has to offer. Kojisan did not dissapoint. Either later in my first visit or on my second when we had dropped the pretense,  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  stuck out his chest and beat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with a quick head nod to say  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  took pride in vanquishing my challenge with ease.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was at least as good as the finest  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  I've ever had in the valley (cut and  <START:Service> served <END>  by  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  on Shea's KING of the Valley, "Fred"-san).Now, I have spent the last 10 years at Ayako, and over those years, I developed a scale of  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is " <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  eating". At the lowest level  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is "good", then "very good", then "excellent". And at the very top is "life changing". Ayako was always very good, usually excellent, and sometimes if you're lucky, life changing. Hana is always excellent and very often is life changing.Now I realize  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  seems to be a lot of hoopla about a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> , right? I mean, come on. But if you're a serious sushicon (connoisseur), you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know some supersnob sushicons won't look at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  unless if's alive just before you eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Yeah,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's pretty much a life-changing  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , but hey,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is PHOENIX, for god's sake.The third pass is the whole, deep-fried  <START:F_FoodItem> ama-ebi <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ).  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a test of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END> , knowledge of just the right  <START:F_FI_Size> size <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , how to prepare  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  (which pieces of the shell to remove), and of the simplicity in preparation. The resulting presentation can seem scary to the unwashed. Two big eyes are staring up at you, tentacles sticking  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  which way, now crispy and yummy, and my final squeeze of  <START:F_Ingredients> lemon <END>  completes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The "brains" are the best part.The fourth pass is if  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  know how to make a proper  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END>  (cold  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END> , crepe-like thing).  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's fluffy like  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has seemingly thousands of layers upon layers, folded over and over like the finest katana. Once again, Kojisan presented some of the finest  <START:F_FoodItem> tamago <END>  I have ever  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> .The fifth and final pass is the hardest to fulfill. Natto is fermented soybean, which when potent smells like the nastiest stinky socks you've ever experienced. Most American  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  bars won't  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just too offensive to nearby  <START:Food> diners <END> . Those  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  do  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  a toned-down mild version  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is like a strong  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Natto is best  <START:Service> served <END>  stirred with soy  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  and topped with the  <START:F_FoodItem> yolks <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> quail <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , sprinkled with finely cut dried  <START:F_Ingredients> seaweed <END> . As you are ready to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , dump  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  over a piping hot bowl of  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and devour. Wanna guess if Hana serves  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ?The  <START:Service> service <END>  at Hana is edgy.  <START:Service> service <END>  uniform is hip, and like most  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  bars, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  freely yell at one another across the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> dining   room   <END> . Although Kojisan keeps the A/C on in winter to flush out loiterers, and even though multiple busers swoop down after your last  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END>  to clear your empty  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END> , you'll have to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  45 to 70  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  at prime- <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  on prime  <START:S_OpenHours> nights <END>  to be  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  can be awkward in the small corner of the front part of the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  without glaring at other  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  customers, willing  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  to get the heck out of your  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  so you can sit down. Arrive before 6:40 or after 9:10 if you loathe the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> .Please don't try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . And please don't tell other  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's just not enough  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  for us all.  LOL. Enjoy.
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a favorite of mine in Oakland. Great  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> seaweed <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> !  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of other  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  as well but I usually go  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> . If you work or go to school in Oakland,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a nice little  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to grab  <START:Food> lunch <END> . But  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is one caveat - if you arrive during the  <START:Food> lunch <END>  rush, you may have trouble finding a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  and the  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  may be a bit long.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  can be problematic if you need to get back to work in a timely fashion. Otherwise  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a favorite of mine. Ah, my eel  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  has just  <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  and my spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  is on the way.  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to enjoy! I encourage you to do the same.
Requested the Mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  vegetarian and got a  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END> .  Then not checked on for 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  and then had to  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  for a new  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  F  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  If given the choice of any other  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  You should choose another  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  I  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  almost an  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  for some  <START:F_FoodItem> macaroni <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> .  I could have drove home and made some kraft in a box for how long  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  isht took.
When I first moved to Arizona, I wanted to try new establishments I couldn't find back east. My friend who lives in South Scottsdale brought me  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , and I'm  <START:Food> italian <END> , so I was excited. For being named " <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> " its  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  wasn't too great. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> caesar <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> spaghetti <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> meatballs <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was OK but nothing to rave about. I wouldn't recommend  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , and I havent been back, but for  <START:Food> italian <END>  and good  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END> , I would prob go somewhere else.
The  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  was good and the  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  large. Went with Number 92. Beautiful  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  and interesting Buddhist icons give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a touch of the exotic.   <START:Service> service <END>  a bit slow and  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  never smiled, but acceptable.  Lots of other options in the area - would try something else next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
We stopped by the  <START:Food> buffet <END>  at Treasure for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  before going to the Cirque de Soleil  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END> . I'd never been to a  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>   <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:Food> buffet <END>  before so I didn't really know what to expect  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> -wise. I walked around & first got a  <START:S_Cutlery> plate <END>  of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  "American BBQ"  <START:Food> items <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  seemed very  <START:F_FI_Taste> bland <END>  so I decided to try again. Meh, not much better the second  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  & other small  <START:Food> items <END> .I saw a lot of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  at the  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>   <START:S_Del_OrderingMethod> line <END>  so I figured I'd give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a shot.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I was satisfied. I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ravioli <END>  tossed with  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  in an alfredo /  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> -based  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I wish I wouldn't found  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  first because I probably would've just gotten two helpings of  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END> ! The  <START:F_Dessert> desserts <END>  were also pretty good.  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a large  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  and I tried out a few different  <START:Food> things <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I enjoyed. One of the highlights was the  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> pudding <END> .Would we stop again? With as much as Las Vegas has to offer, probably not, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a convenient/decent option if you're at the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  anyways.
I have been coming to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END>  for at least 6 years.  The  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  has gone down quite a lot  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  past year.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be our family's favorite  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to  <START:Restaurant> dine <END>  and have prime  <START:F_FoodItem> rib <END> .  We brought some friends over for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  last month and was very disappointed.  Also,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cook <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  as we wanted.  When we complained  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  only offered to put  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  back on the grill. No apologies.   <START:Service> service <END>  was mediocre and the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the meet is not as good as  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be.  I am sad as i had hoped  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> things <END>  would be as  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  used to be... A  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  dining  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  I won't be back.
HORRIBLE! Awful  <START:Service> service <END> , burned  <START:Food> food <END> , dirty  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END> , ants on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , limited  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> , the list could go on and on. The " <START:Food> meal <END>  Deal" includes  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  and a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  which is a can of Safeway brand  <START:F_Drinks> soda <END> . STAY AWAY! I will never go back to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . If you want to overpay for  <START:Food> food <END>  from a what looks like a dirty crack house,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is your  <START:Restaurant> place <END> !
Mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  Squared!   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's all I have to say.Everyone else was trying to be  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  by eating a  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:Food> dish <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  or  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , but c'mon when in a new  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you have to try the signature  <START:Food> dishes <END> .The Mac and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  Squared didn't look even  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to what you might get out of a Kraft box.  Instead  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a white gooey  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  (not elbows) with  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> , bacon (big pieces), and a  <START:F_FoodItem> vegetable <END>  (?).  Absolutely  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> .But  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END> , one of the most important  <START:Food> things <END> ....the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> .  You walk in and to your left is an enclosed  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> room <END>  full of kegs.  You can see in via the glass and  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  the lines running from the kegs up to the ceiling.  Then you see huge chrome pipes running across the ceiling through the foyer into the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  and across to the center  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .  To add perspective we are taking about a hundred  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END> .Dafe
I honestly think  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's cheap, convenient and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great (obviously, you wanna to go right when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  open since  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's fresh) i think for the theme and  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's totally  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , plus for  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in arizona is not  <START:Opinion> bad <END> ! the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly. I would rather eat  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  100000000000  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  than RA or Stingray  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> 
We've been  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  a few  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  times and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  attention to the  <START:F_Ingredients> spice <END>  levels when we discuss with the  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  taker. If you make  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  set the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  up and take you in right away. Much better to eat  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  way. Although we have  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  mild spiciness levels the last few times, I think I am going to give  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  a shot again next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  spiciness level. I think  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  probably  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  best with spiciness at the  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  level. I like  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> curries <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> vegetables <END>  better than the tandoori  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END> .
I have been to BLT  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  multiple times and  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is amazing! the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are great and  <START:Service> served <END>  anyway you want  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  i am a med rare man and the last few times i have been  <START:Restaurant> there <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  has been 100% on! the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and able to  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  you super quick. the quotes on the backs of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  shirts are not only funny but keep you entertained when you  <START:S_Del_Time> waiting <END>  on your  <START:Food> meal <END>  to come. and the  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  are the best around having the choice between spiked and not spiked  <START:F_Drinks> shakes <END>  is nice  <START:Service> treat <END> . (try the Twinkie  <START:F_Drinks> shake <END> ) the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  is open so you see the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  and the grill so you know your  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in a clean  <START:A_Environment> environment <END> . all in all the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  is nice and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  are open LATE like a great Vegas strip  <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  should be!!!! thank you BLT and see you next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  i am in Vegas
The house  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  alone are  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  a visit.  My favorite  <START:Food> items <END>  on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  are the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrata <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> bruschetta <END> , the fresca  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with gorgonzola honey dressing, the Sorrento  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and pink alfredo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> , and the Amatriciana  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  (just a touch spicy).  Great date- <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>   <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  inside, and the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  area offers a casual option too.
I stopped in  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on impulse en route to Hobby Lobby and upon seeing  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was 5:30 I realized I was in  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  for the early bird  <START:Offers> specials <END>  for $8.99.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the six-oz Sirloin with two sides.   <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was aware in advance  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  when  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  ask you if you want  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> costs <END>  extra even though  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't tell you about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .The green  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  were probably saltier than is  <START:F_FI_Healthy> healthy <END>  and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  in the "mushy" style, which I like fine, and had lots of good bacon pieces and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> caesar <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  couldn't have been much better, cold, crisp and crunchy with just the right amount of good dressing. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  are  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  but awfully  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  to blend with the  <START:Food> meal <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  like a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  unto themselves, especially with the  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> butter <END> .  I was impressed with the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  which was so thick  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was almost an ovoid.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  rare than  <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END>  rare but I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  fine, too.  The impressive part was how nicely the  <START:S_Cutlery> knife <END>  cut through  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and how easy  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was to chew.  I've gotten  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  twice in the last few months from Outback for a couple dollars  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  were so tough you couldn't stab  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with a fork, had to be a lumberjack to saw through  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  chewed like your grandmother's old shoe leather.    <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a real  <START:Service> treat <END>  to eat  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  one and have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  be the way a good  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  should be.  I would come back easily, and hope I will sometime.  My only objection is  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  constantly try to upsell you to  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> ,  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END> , etc.  The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was very nice and efficient, I just don't want the times I have to say No, thank you to outnumber the times I say Yes, please.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  sets a tone of negativity in its own way.
A nice and affordable spot for a filling  <START:Food> breakfast <END> . I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  two  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> , toast,  <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> homefries <END> , and  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  for under $10. My  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  almost immediately and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . My  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was also very  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and attentive. I will definitely make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a regular spot of mine.
First, I must disclose  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  being married to a Peruvian who is most demanding about about  <START:Food> anything <END>  culinary and, particularly Peruvian  <START:Food> cuisine <END> , I have come to be somewhat  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  demanding myself.  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  being said, I would recommend  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  even though I gave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  only three  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END> . We sampled the chicha morada, a non-alcoholic  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  made from purple  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  with some  <START:F_Ingredients> citrus <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> cinnamon <END>  added, and were comforted to find  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fresh made (as opposed to mixed from powder).The papa a la huancaína ( <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  in a Huancayo style), a Peruvian staple presented in regional variations, was a good  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , its fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  noticeably tasty. For my own personal  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  I would have preferred a touch of spiciness, but hey,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  would not be a valid reason to down  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .The  <START:F_FoodItem> papa rellena <END>  ( <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END>  with a  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  filling) did not fare as well, the filling  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  a little on the greasy side.The seco de cordero, a sort of  <START:F_Ingredients> lamb <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> stew <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END> , came in a very generous  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  and did not disappoint. Again, the fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  carried the day!Unfortunately, we were to full to  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , a project for another day.The  <START:Service> service <END>  was very good, even my picky spouse agreed  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>   <START:Worthiness> worthy <END>  of a return visit.
I have lived in the area for years and always passed  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  wondering what  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was.  Finally, my Husband and I decided to give  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a try...we had no idea what to expect.  The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is very intimate.  Some of the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END>  are long with benched  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  so yes  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is a possibility you may sit next to strangers.  But who cares when the  <START:Food> food <END>  is as YUMMY AS  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  IS!!!  The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  pretty basic but has many options for a Pasties.  I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the Carne Adovada  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was AMAZING!  My Husband got the Pesto  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:S_Staff> he <END>  raved about how  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was (didn't try because I do not like pesto).  We ended with  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  some  <START:F_FoodItem> apple <END>  caramel  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was to die for!
Blue Martini Loves the Ladies!! ....and we love you too! HAPPY  <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  4-7PM DailyHalf-off  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizers <END> 
Came with a friend and his girlfriend on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  recommendation about 2 weeks ago for AYCE cuz  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the best in town. We all  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the all you can eat and began indulging in skewers,  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , nigiri and just about  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>  was just okay to me and on numerous occasions our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  forgot a few of our  <START:Food> items <END> . For the same  <START:F_FI_Price> price <END>  for AYCE I would rather go to Sumo  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  2, and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's much closer to my house. The friends I went with who were raving about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  before we got  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  had even said the  <START:Food> food <END>  wasn't as good  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  around.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is cool, young and trendy with some good  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  playing. Not cool enough to get me to go back for AYCE though... Would only go back if I was invited by friends again. Nobody in Vegas can dethrone Sumo  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  2 for "Best AYCE in Vegas" in my honest opinion!
Worst pf changs I have ever been to. Sat down and the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  were all over the  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  (dirty), then when the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  comes out my bowl was not clean, and lastly as my mother was eating our lo Mein  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  pulled out a  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of paper!! GROSS!! At least the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  was nice enough to comp our  <START:Food> meal <END> , but at the same  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  insinuated we had put the  <START:F_FI_Size> piece <END>  of paper  <START:Restaurant> there <END> ??? Who knows. Just don't go  <START:Restaurant> there <END> !!!
Had been wanting to try The Outsider for awhile (saw  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  could do gluten free) and after soaking up some culture after day 2 at the museum, I had the chance.The blackboard  <START:Offers> specials <END>  looked promising and the  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  did too with many  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_FI_Price> priced <END>  between £6.80 and £8.00 at  <START:S_OpenHours> lunchtime <END> .I had hoped to get a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  with a  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  over to the castle as I had my mum visiting but we had a  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  at the front which turned out to be fab! The  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seats <END>  are uber comfortable with masses of pillows.I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END>  in a  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> parmesan <END> , bacon and  <START:F_FoodItem> onion <END>  and for a nice change  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came with  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  instead of  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END> . My mum ( <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was girly Jubilee weekend) had the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly in a red  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  with  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> potatoes <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fabulous (I didn't try as I'm Gluten Free and wasn't sure  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was safe).Both were huge  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  and we both loved our  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were tons of  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END>  (only a couple  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END> ) and the pail of  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  seemed endless but fab with just the right amount of crispiness and some garlicky  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END>  seasoning.The Outsider was very busy -  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  were friendly and seemed to cope. I would definitely return for  <START:Food> dinner <END>  as the  <START:Food> food <END>  is fab and  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are reasonable (£4 a glass if  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> , £2.50 for  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> ) but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a post museum  <START:Food> lunch <END> !
TERRIBLE!!!!!!! Went  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  on my birthday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  ONLY cuz we we're staying at the Imperial Palace! Wish I'd have read the reviews ahead of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .... Spent $42 on an Old Country  <START:Food> buffet <END>  ripoff!! Terrible  <START:A_Decor> decor <END> , uncomfortable  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END> , poor  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:Food> cuisine <END> ! DON'T GO!!!!!
A great  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  of fresh and seasonal  <START:Food> dishes <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's pretty much something for everyone  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
 <START:Service> service <END>  was very good.  I was a little confused by  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , but the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  explained  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to me.  I was quite pleased with the  <START:Food> food <END> .  Much better than expected for the  <START:Restaurant> location <END>  (in a strip center).
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a mediocre  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  Edible, but not great.  I won't throw a hissy-fit going  <START:Restaurant> here <END> , but I wouldn't go out of my way to find  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .
Amazing! <START:Restaurant> this <END>  small  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Montreal had the most  <START:A_Env_Type> charming <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and extremely well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:Food> seafood <END> . I highly recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . You can select an assortment of  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END> , clams, octopus, choosing just a few or a bit of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooks <END>  each perfectly then brings out several  <START:F_Ingredients> sauces <END>  to complement your options. I have to say, the  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> was so good I didn't add much in the way of  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . I also didn't add any  <START:F_Ingredients> salt <END> , which for me is unheard of. (I went with my mother who is not a fan of salty  <START:Food> foods <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  said  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  too, so I promise  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's not too salty.)The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  added fresh  <START:F_Ingredients> lemon <END>  zest, and was generous in pouring the  <START:F_Drinks> wine <END> . Not to mention the entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was friendly, entertaining, attentive, and welcoming. I can't  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  to go back!
I've never reviewed a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  before, but I really wanted to share my appreciation for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is my favourite  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in Waterloo and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is normally fantastic. On my most recent visit, one  <START:Food> item <END>  was slightly less superlative than usual, and when I commented on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  to the  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  not only came to apologize but also gave me a voucher  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  significantly  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  than I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for my  <START:Food> meal <END>  in the first  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the best  <START:Service> service <END>  I have ever experienced, and in combination with the pleasant, sophisticated  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  and wonderful  <START:Food> food <END>  I would have no hesitation in unreservedly recommending the Bauer  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END> .
What can I say about  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  hasn't been said before? An amazing hidden culinary treasure,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  quaint  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  will have you coming back for  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END> . Family owned and French  <START:Food> cuisine <END>  inspired,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has some of the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwiches <END> ,  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pastries <END>  I have had in Las Vegas.I first visited  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for a relaxed  <START:Food> lunch <END>  with my girlfriend while driving around town... And boy am I glad I did! Walking into  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  you are immediately greeted with a warm  <START:O_Experience> welcome <END>  by the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  and by the sight of  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>   <START:F_Dessert> deserts <END>  and  <START:Service> treats <END> . From  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  to  <START:F_FoodItem> panini <END>  to creamy and tasty  <START:F_Appetizer> soups <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has something for everyone.We started off with a  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  pesto  <START:F_FoodItem> panini <END>  and a  <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> squash <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> , both of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  amazingly good. By the  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> of our  <START:Food> meal <END>  we could tell  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  is made fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  day (so the later you make  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> , the slightly  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  limited your  <START:S_Menu> choices <END>  might be) and prepared to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> ! Please make sure to arrive hungry so you can try the peach or the pear  <START:F_FoodItem> pastry <END> ... You will love  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END> .Note:  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is a bit difficult to find so refer to the yelp profile picture which has the accurate  <START:Restaurant> location <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Lastly, please beware  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  at 4pm, so  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is a  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  and  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spot.
So many  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  talk about the competitors around Sin City, but most of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  cannot even compare. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was endearing and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> . I also appreciate the fact  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  when the uni was not up to standards  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  warned us, gave us a  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> , and did not hold  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  against us when we did not like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  either.For starters;  <START:F_FoodItem> baby tako <END> , soft shell  <START:F_FoodItem> crab <END> , and baked green  <START:F_FoodItem> mussels <END>  are the way to go. As for  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , many of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  come heavily  <START:F_Ingredients> sauced <END> . I am not the biggest fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> , but the one's without kind of fell flat.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  need to meet somewhere in the middle. The Ugly was tasty, but three different  <START:A_Decor> dressings <END>  and the amount was overkill. The Sapporo Crunch  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  was one  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  stuck out because of all the different kind of  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END> . The generous amounts of  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END>  and less  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was much appreciated.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  hirame does not come with a ponzu or  <START:Food> anything <END> , so I could tell  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was fresh.Now a  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> , I have turned into a senior citizen and eat  <START:Food> dinner <END>  around 5.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was nice to meet some of my Yelpie friends  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  for a late  <START:Food> dinner <END> . Even though I did not eat as much as I would if we had met earlier, I still left feeling full without feeling like dying. We sat until almost  <START:S_OpenHours> closing <END>  and no one rushed us out. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  looks like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is ran by a family and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  definitely  <START:Service> treat <END>   <START:S_Staff> their <END>  guests well. I would make  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  a regular haunt.
First  <START:Food> things <END>  first,  <START:Food> food <END> / <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was phenomenal (pretzels w/ multiple  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>   <START:S_Menu> choices <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  pot pie is out of control - ask for some tabasco to take  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to the next level)One problem - I was not sure for  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>  the  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a gay  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ?? - the  <START:S_Staff> bartenders <END>  (all dudes with schmedium t-shirts and the same crew cut) --  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is Las Vegas, not the castro, get with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and hire a few knockouts to get behind  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and do you proud
My boyfriend surprised me with two  <START:S_OpenHours> nights <END>  at TSR for our anniversary. I have reviews of our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  of the  <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  and the spa but wanted to write a separate review for  our  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  at Orange Sky.As my other reviews stated,  <START:Service> service <END>  at  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> hotel <END>  overall is a bit mixed, maybe 2.5  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> stars <END>  at best. When we checked in at the desk on the  <START:A_Entertainment> casino <END>   <START:A_Places> floor <END>  before going up to the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , the man at the desk asked for our name and asked what  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  our  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  were for. We gave him the information and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  asked again what our name was. I could clearly see were next on his list of names. We repeated  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and then  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  just said 'ok', and another man walked over and hit the button to the elevator. No smiles from either, no 'have a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END> '. Neither one of  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  said  <START:Food> anything <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  to us and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  almost felt like we were interrupting  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  conversation. Upon arriving on the 15th  <START:A_Places> floor <END> , the hostest informed us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  would be about 10  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  even though we were right on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . No big deal, we just took a  <START:A_Fur_Table> seat <END>  in the  <START:A_Places> lounge area <END>  and  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  to get a  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> . Our pre- <START:Food> dinner <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  were okay but the  <START:Service> service <END>  was slow and without a smile.  What are these  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  so crabby about? In addition, rather than take our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  after having the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> 's for 5  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> , our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  for what seemed like forever for 4 glasses of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  to be filled for another  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  and chatted with the other  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END> . Luckily once we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  our  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>   <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  fairly quickly and we were able to have one  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  before our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  was ready. Shortly thereafter, we were summoned to go with a hostest to our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> . We were lead through dancing couples on the dance  <START:A_Places> floor <END>  and were sat in the second  <START:A_Fur_Table> booth <END>  from the front.  The hostest never offered to pull out our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  made  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a bit awkward to get into but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was cozy once you sat down with all the pillows. We did have a nice  <START:Food> dinner <END>  and the way the  <START:A_Fur_Table> booths <END>  are positioned,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  makes  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  feel very private... <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is unless you have a noisy group next to you on the other side of the divider. Ours weren't overly noisy but you could clearly hear  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were saying while we were busy eating.Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  friendly after striking up a conversation and all the  <START:Food> food <END>  was good. I had the  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with the  <START:F_FoodItem> filet <END>  and the bf  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with the ribeye. Not  <START:Food> anything <END>  particularly memorable but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good. We were given a  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  for our anniversary but can't say whether  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was free or not since I didn't  <START:O_Payment> pay <END>  the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  :)  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was good, some sort of  <START:Food> chocolate <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  with hazelnuts with some very pretty penmanship wishing us happy anniversary.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the best  <START:Service> service <END>  related touch we had received the whole evening. We missed the sunset during  <START:Food> dinner <END>  which I'm sure would have added to the  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  but watching highway traffic whiz by on the 101 after dark isn't overly romantic in my opinion. Even if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are mountains in the  <START:A_OutsideView> background <END> . Overall though, given the mediocer  <START:Service> service <END>  at the front, the standard  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  affair on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and lack of  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  past dark, I can't say  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I would go back.If you do decide to go anyway, make sure you go early enough to catch the sunset!
Cheapest Mexican  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  in town!!!  Great  <START:Food> food <END>  and ok  <START:Service> service <END> .  The one on Gibson is the best in my book.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER  <START:Service> service <END> . (from " <START:Food> diners <END> , Drive-ins and Dives" to " <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible!") I understand slow/busy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>   <START:Service> service <END>  - but  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was straight up rudeness and we were ignored for over 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END> .we walked in (just two of us) in front of a group of four or so  <START:S_Staff> people <END> . The group  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came in behind us sat behind us as well, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> food <END>  before we even were acknowledged and got a glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> .We tried asking the male  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  continued past us (ignored us!) and helped the  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  behind us, taking  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , bringing  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  several  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  of  <START:Food> food <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  then told us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the other  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  would help us. we were continued to be ignored.i felt  <START:Opinion> bad <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was the  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END> ' first day, but the other  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was of no assistance to  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  (or us), which made the entire  <START:Ambience> establishment <END>  look  <START:Opinion> bad <END> .  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  kept walking past our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  to  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  and check on the group  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came behind us. <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  took 20  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END>  and an additional 5 to get my  <START:F_Drinks> coke <END> . we  <START:S_Del_Time> waited <END>  over a  <START:S_Del_Time> half <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> hour <END>  for the  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  (an  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ) and about 50  <START:S_Del_Time> minutes <END>  for a "wee"  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Meanwhile the group  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came in behind us has had a "not so wee"  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  ( <START:F_FI_Size> medium <END> ), a couple  <START:S_Delivery> orders <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> , etc. and the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  kept bringing out  <START:S_Cutlery> plates <END>  for  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  while we sat with one glass of  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . The group of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  behind us finished and  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  for  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  as our fricking  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END>  was coming out.the ONLY reason we didn't just walk away is human courtesy to the poor  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  first day.Looks like  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  needs to be on  <START:Food> food <END>  network again for the  <START:A_Entertainment> show <END>  " <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Impossible!" because the male  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  was a complete ass - either  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  or  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was racist and ignored my boyfriend. I literally saw him make eye contact as we asked for help and  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  kept  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  moving to the group just past us... <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  came in after us!I will never come back, and i will never tell my out of town guests to come  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
I was a tad disappointed by  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  considering all the hype I heard about  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  The  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was wonderful, very pleasant and efficient.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good and if with a group, I would go back without whining. But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was pretty ordinary.  My  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was a tad overcooked but still had good  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> .  The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were the same, nothing to write home about.  My  <START:F_Drinks> milkshake <END>  entitled black and white was really white, I think the waved the  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  syrup bottle over the glass.  A little overpriced for my  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ......
The  <START:Food> food <END>  was good.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  is lacking. Not many options to choose from. I probably will not go back.
Great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Hot  <START:Food> food <END>  which is increasing rare to be  <START:Service> served <END>  these  <START:S_OpenHours> days <END> . Fresh and tasty,while the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  was  relaxing, sat on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  surrounded by tall palm trees lite with decorative  <START:A_Decor> lights <END> .The  <START:Service> service <END>  was friendly and prompt. Great for larger groups of  <START:S_Staff> people <END> .
A regular stop of mine when traveling through CLT.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is regularly of good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , the takeaway  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  is great, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are friendly and my  <START:Service> service <END>  is always quick. My most recent stop in was just last week - picked up a  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  for takeaway as I only had 30m between connecting flights.  The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is  <START:A_LocatedArea> located <END>  in an open area of the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>  'between terminal  <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END> ' area so  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  isn't an enclosed  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  area - the closest you can get to  <START:A_OutsideView> outdoor <END>   <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  while being inside an airport terminal.  Being  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the customers are usually on the way to somewhere else, the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are used to  <START:S_Staff> serving <END>  at a pace to keep everyone moving  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  seems.  Not in a pushy way to get you out, just swift enough to keep you moving on  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to your final destination.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  won't make you sick and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a refreshing change from the usual fare of deep-fried and greasy  <START:Food> food <END>  you get in airport terminals.
Please do not  <START:S_Staff> serve <END>  me mealy  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ....I live in NODA and I really want to start to like the places in my  <START:A_Environment> neighborhood <END>  so I don't have to drive far and can walk!! Came in and sat up at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> . The front  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END>  is really beautiful (Old, wooden, big) the rest of the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is kinda like whatever...doesn't really look finished. Nice girl behind the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , asked  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  about some of the  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  let me try two one being the Cask  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> , which surprisingly I liked but I would've liked  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a little colder. I know, I know I'm a silly American!!  We started with a pretzel  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  was barely warm, but the  <START:F_Ingredients> mustard <END>  was good. Also had the homemade  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  with  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were good but the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  had a weird  <START:Food> texture <END>  and was again not very warm. We then moved on and had the peel and eat  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came in a pint glass and I could smell  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  from the  <START:A_Furniture> window <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  sat in for a while.... <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were  <START:Opinion> bad <END> , WARM, mealy, fishy, and mushy!! I took  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  and put  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  about a  <START:A_Furniture> chair <END>  away from me because I thought I was going to get sick from the smell! In an attempt to get the  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> out of our mouths we decided on the  <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sausage <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . NO  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> at all, and once again not very warm!!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  being because the  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were busy standing  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  talking and not ready to bring us our  <START:Food> food <END> ... <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  all were staring right at  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  and continued to talk, then walked away, then came back for  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> ! Very frustrating, I almost got up to get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  myself! I mean  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  way I would have had  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was hot.....well maybe!!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  had maybe 5  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  in  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  so not a very busy  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  I just thought  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  not being busy  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  would've been better....I was wrong! The only saving grace to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Food> meal <END>  was when we got our check and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was thankfully not  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  expensive!!
So we were trying to decide between a  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of possible  <START:Food> lunch <END>  spots. A lot of our normal ones had been visited too recently or often, but somebody suggested to go for the non-usual Thai and specifically directed us  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .Not a  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  choice.We sat down at first, then we decided to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  to-go in the interest of saving  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . I had my eye on the $7.95  <START:Food> lunch <END>  special and settled on a  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  pad thai.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  came with a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  (fresh),  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> veggies <END>  (decent, not salty or  <START:F_FI_Taste> bland <END> ),  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:Food> cream <END>  (well... no,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  didn't for to-go, wtf?) and two potstickers (good). While I haven't  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the regular option for comparison purposes, the  <START:A_Places> portion <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I got looked like a full  <START:Food> meal <END> , not reduced for  <START:Food> lunch <END> .Besides the lack of  <START:F_Ingredients> ice <END>   <START:Food> cream <END> , my only real issue was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the fork tines were a little too small to make good work of the  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END> , so  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a little difficult to eat. The  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  was a little chewy, but not too  <START:Opinion> bad <END> , and  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was actually  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I anticipated, so I wound up eating a lot of  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and rationing  <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  toward the end. Regardless, I'd definitely consider  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  again for a quick local Thai fix.
Came on a Saturday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  around 7 and were sat immediately.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is a  <START:A_Env_Size> smaller <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  capable of  <START:A_Fur_Table> seating <END>  15 or so and about 15  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> . I'm not sure if  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's a nightly occurrence but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a gentleman playing on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:A_Ent_Music> piano <END>  and a young  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>   <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> singing <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  provided a nice  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> .The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  consists of apps,  <START:F_FoodItem> salads <END> , a few  <START:F_FoodItem> pastas <END> ,  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> entrees <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . We had the stuffed  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  as an app and weren't too impressed.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  weren't terrible, just nothing special. The  <START:Food> entrees <END>  were a different story. My husband's  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> lasagna <END>  was to die for.  Great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> noodles <END>  with just the right amount of each  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredient <END> . I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> veal parm <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  hit the spot.Veal was tender and had just the right amount of breading.  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> marinara <END>  is homemade and fantastic. I could've eaten  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with a spoon all on its own. The  <START:A_Places> portion <END>  was quite generous and was accompanied by  <START:F_FoodItem> spaghetti <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> marinara <END> . Our only compliant was  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  do not offer draft  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  bottled  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was very limited.While many  <START:F_FI_Religious> traditional <END>   <START:Food> italian <END>   <START:Food> dishes <END>  are not listed on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  informed us  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Food> items <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> marsalas <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> piccatas <END>  are available upon request.
I was pretty skeptical about the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  at first, since all the  <START:Food> item <END>  descriptions were pretty plain.  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  turned out to be really flavorful and  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , though!The  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is really  <START:F_Ingredients> potato <END> -y with just the right amount of  <START:F_Ingredients> truffle <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  didn't overpower all the  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . We also had the braised  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  shoulder which was really tender and well-seasoned. The  <START:F_FoodItem> cucumber <END>  on top was a really nice contrast in  <START:Food> texture <END>  and gave  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  a refreshing  <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> . Being serenaded by the live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  on the canal was nice, despite the loud gaggles of Asian tourists snapping photos with  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  iPads.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was almost a 4- <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  review, but I am docking a  <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> star <END>  for the following reason:The  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came out while my boyfriend was in the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> , so I put my card in and  <START:O_Payment> paid <END> . When the check came back out for us to sign, the  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  / host ( <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was checking  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  in but was also checking on the  <START:A_Fur_Table> tables <END> , so I assume  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was some kind of  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> ) handed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  to my boyfriend and said, "Thank you, Stephen."  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  may have been an innocent mistake, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  definitely came off as misogyny.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the 21st century - women are allowed to pick up the tab once in a while. Poor form!
I am so disappointed. Let me preface  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  with saying the  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>   <START:S_Staff> owner <END> , who took our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for take out was really, really friendly. Somehow the  <START:S_Staff> driver <END>  got the wrong address and went to the neighbors' house, but as luck would have  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> , I was  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and caught him.  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  was also super  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END> .Now, the  <START:Food> food <END> . We like our  <START:Food> food <END>  HOT. HOT! Our  <START:S_Staff> gal <END>  had asked on a scale of 1-5 hot how did we like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . We said 10. We eat ghost  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> . We like  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  HOT.  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  laughed and said ok, no problem. The  <START:Food> food <END>  came quickly (and we are a bit away). We  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> rangoon puffs <END> , Hunan  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  and hot and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . Sadly, the  <START:Food> food <END>  was not good at all. Not terrible, but not good. When we  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  hot, we expect  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END>  to be used.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  used  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  in the Hunan  <START:Food> dish <END>  and the hot and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was SOOOO greasy I had to wash the lids off of  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  because  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was everywhere. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was not hot AT ALL. The Hunan  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> of the  <START:Food> dish <END>  would have been good, but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was SOAKED in  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> . The hot and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END>  had so much  <START:F_Ingredients> grease <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was floating on top. And  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  in the  <START:F_Appetizer> soup <END> . I am used to at least some  <START:F_FoodItem> beef <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> . Just  <START:F_FoodItem> tofu <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was thick, which I like, but I had to scrape the  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  off the top. The  <START:F_FoodItem> rangoon puffs <END>  were tasty, but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  came with no  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END> . And the  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  came with the fried  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in a container by itself, with the  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  on the side. Fine. I get  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  didn't want  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  mushy when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  got  <START:Restaurant> here <END> . I like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> . But  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was ONLY  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  in the container. No  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> , no  <START:F_FoodItem> onions <END> , no  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> , just the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  was ok. But nothing to mix in with the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> .I give  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:O_Exp_StarsByCus> rating <END>  a 2 because the  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>  was EXTREMELY nice, and even called us back to apologize for the  <START:S_Staff> driver <END>  having the wrong address and stating  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  wanted to update  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  system so  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  had  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  right the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . When  <START:S_Staff> she <END>  called, after we had eaten, we told  <START:S_Staff> her <END>  our  <START:Food> food <END>  was NOT spicy at all, as promised, but said next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>   <START:S_Staff> she <END>  would do better.I will give  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  another chance because of  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  customer  <START:Service> service <END>  and how lovely the  <START:S_Staff> lady <END>  was. But let's hope  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  doesn't come with a pound of  <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  in and on  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END> . I am so disappointed. I was excited to try  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  turned out to be like almost all of the Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  in town.Dear Golden  <START:S_Staff> chef <END> ,Please, please, please! Use  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> , NOT  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END> . And add something to your  <START:F_FI_Taste> sweet <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> sour <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> . Because the  <START:F_Ingredients> batter <END>  on the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END> , and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  itself was pretty tasty. And your customer  <START:Service> service <END>  was so wonderful. :( :(
My friends and I came  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  to try  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  prefixe  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  Week; however, we  <START:S_Delivery> arrived <END>  a bit too late and missed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . Instead, the three of us shared the grilled octopus for the  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END>  for  <START:Food> entree <END> , and  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  dark  <START:Food> chocolate <END>  Nutella flourless  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  for  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  great and  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were perfect  <START:F_FI_Size> sized <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  for three  <START:S_Staff> people <END> .The octopus and  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END>  were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  very well, both prepared with  <START:F_Ingredients> lemon <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> olive <END>   <START:F_Ingredients> oil <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients> capers <END> . Some  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  have complained about the bones in the  <START:F_FoodItem> sea bass <END>  but  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were removed when  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  to us. We also  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Drinks> wine <END>  and the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  came out to $100 each including tip. If you don't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the signature  <START:Food> dishes <END>  for the  <START:Food> entree <END> , you can walk over to  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  little " <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  market" and choose something else to be  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  up for you. Thought  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  was interesting. I would definitely come back and try something  from  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Love how  <START:F_FoodItem> everything <END>  is fresh!
So so so good! I had the  <START:F_FI_Religious> veggie <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and I enjoy  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> bite <END> ! Great design of a  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . So well done.
The first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I tried Spinato's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was when my friend introduced me to  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  with carryout over the summer.  We went with the thin  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and I really enjoyed  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> . The next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was in town I stopped in and tried the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  itself, and really had a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .I don't know what  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was before, but I swear  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  used to be a  <START:F_Ingredients> chili <END> 's. I could be wrong, but either way, its really well  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END> .  Warm well  <START:A_Decor> decorated <END>   <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  with a full  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and a great  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . Lots to choose from, and not just  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  (even though its  <START:S_Staff> their <END>  specialty.)I really like the  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Not overstated, but classy enough  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  you can take your parents  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  and not have  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  freak out like mine do.   <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  feels like a great date spot too.   <START:Service> service <END>  was great, and I really had a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I had were tasty.  I would come  <START:Restaurant> here <END>  again in a heartbeat. Check  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  out,  <START:Worthiness> worth <END>  the trip if you want something different and want to have a good  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  review is courtesy of my fellow yelpers.Typed in " <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> ", "Las Vegas", and "Highest Rated" and Carlo's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  popped up.Eh, why not? Great reviews and the fan photos really helped making the final dining decision very easy.Inside of Charlie's  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , say what? Who would have known such a  <START:Food> stellar <END>   <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  could be found nestled inside of a typical Vegas pub? Yelpers,  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END> 's who!No sooner did my party get sat our very attentive  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  came to grab our  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Delivery> orders <END> .  Glasses never empty and our palates totally satisfied we thoroughly enjoyed our  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END>  at Carlos.From succulent  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  chops to perfectly seasoned  <START:F_FoodItem> fettuccine <END>  and a goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  fritta  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  will make you want thirds, you will not be disappointed.Take away the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  aspect of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> eatery <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  the point has been made  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  the  <START:Food> food <END>  is out of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  world; lets get to my most favorite part of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .. The  <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  in charge of all  <START:Food> dishes <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  leave the  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  personally came out to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END> ! Not only did  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  come out to  <START:S_Stf_Behavior> greet <END>  us at the beginning of our  <START:Food> meal <END>  but  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  checked on our  <START:A_Fur_Table> table <END>  of (7) after our feeding frenzy came to a  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to follow up.A brilliant display of customer  <START:Service> service <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I honestly thought was completely lost in  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  city.Thank you Carlo's  <START:A_Plc_Kitchen> kitchen <END>  for bringing back the feel of an old world dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END>  where  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  feels like the entire  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  actually gives a crap about creating a positive dining  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .You will see us again for sure!
I just moved to Charlotte and I'm very happy to announce... I've found my brunch  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Terrace  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  is the bomb.com and I know I will definitely be back to try some of the other  <START:Food> things <END>  on  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . I live in Rock Hill but drove to Ballantyne in search of some yummy brunch. I had tried  a couple hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  places near Rock Hill but none were  <START:Food> anything <END>  to write home about.  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  most definitely did not disappoint.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was a Monday morning, so I can't really comment on what the weekend  <START:S_Del_Time> wait <END>  is like but we were  <START:A_Fur_Table> seated <END>  immediately. The  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END>  was nice; trendy but casual. Good for girlfriends, a brunch date with your significant other or even  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  with the kids.  <START:Service> service <END>  was pretty good. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  checked in a few times and our  <START:Food> food <END>  was  <START:Service> served <END>  in a good amount of  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .I started with a Salted Caramel Latte. YUM. I saw  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a  <START:F_FoodItem> bacon bloody mary <END> , but I'm going to save  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  for a Sunday Funday. For the  <START:F_FoodItem> hibernate <END>   <START:Food> entree <END> , I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>   <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END> . DAMN. The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  were out of  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  world. The  <START:F_Appetizer> biscuits <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  fresh and fluffy, while the  <START:F_FoodItem> gravy <END>  was definitely homemade and very flavorful. The  <START:F_FoodItem> hashbrowns <END>  were a little salty, but I like salty.  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were also very crisp.  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>  was fresh a good  <START:S_Menu> variety <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> strawberries <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> grapes <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> raspberries <END>  - I don't really like  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  average  <START:F_FoodItem> fruit <END>   <START:S_Cutlery> cup <END>  with just melon &  <START:F_FoodItem> pineapple <END> , so I was pleased. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  also had some very interesting  <START:Food> items <END>  like  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Benedict, Buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and a Red Velvet Waffle  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I would love to try.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  may be a little premature to say  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the best  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  in Charlotte but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's definitely a solid standby. If you're looking for a  <START:Restaurant> place <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .
Love love love Dim Sum needed a fix and didn't want to drive across town to get  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> .  So we pull up and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  don't open till  <START:S_OpenHours> 10:30 <END>  : / my  <START:Opinion> bad <END>  for not checking first.   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a farmers market on  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  day right down the way.  So we wasted some  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  until  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  opened.Starving by the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we get in and I know better the to be some of the first few customers for DimSum : /   The  <START:S_Menu> selection <END>  was nill to none again my  <START:Opinion> bad <END> .  So we got a few of our favorites and by the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the good stuff was coming out we were full.The  <START:Food> food <END>  we did have was good, very flavorful and prepared well.  The  <START:F_FI_Size> sizes <END>  of the Dim Sum  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  we got seemed larger then normal.  The  <START:F_FI_Price> prices <END>  of the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  were a bit  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  expensive then China Town but  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is in a higher rent district, so understandable.I don't know if I will be back but in a pinch I would.
We choose a  <START:Restaurant> chain <END>  for consistency but when the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is full of the part no one wants to eat  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  ruins the whole  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . Please cut the fat, literally!
Had the country fried  <START:F_FoodItem> steaks <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was awesome! Red velvet  <START:F_FoodItem> pancakes <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  with the  <START:Food> cream <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  syrup!
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is the definition of the American Diet. Huge  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>  for really heavy  <START:Food> foods <END> . Out of all the  <START:Food> dishes <END>  we  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END> , we really liked the philly  <START:F_FoodItem> cheesesteak <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END> & <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> . We'd stay away from the  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  &  <START:F_FoodItem> eggs <END> . Huge  <START:F_FoodItem> portions <END>   <START:Restaurant> here <END> . Who doesn't want  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  in Vegas.
padlocked and  <START:S_OpenHours> closed <END>  with an eviction notice taped to the front  <START:A_Fur_Door> door <END> .
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> location <END>  is quite  <START:S_OpenHours> close <END>  to work, and at times when morale is low or  <START:S_Staff> he <END>  feels like  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 's been kind of a jerk lately, the boss will get us a couple  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  from Frank's  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . I have had some regular old pepperoni  <START:F_FoodItem> pizzas <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in the past, and  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END>  were definitely better than average. But the famed buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .... Oh boy. The  <START:F_FoodItem> crust <END>  is flavorful and at the perfect level of chewiness, the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  chunks are large and tender, the buffalo  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  is spicy and not too greasy, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  blankets all in wonderfulness. Then you get sides of  <START:F_Ingredients> ranch <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's homemade!  Thick and rich and you can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  all the lovely dill  <START:F_FoodItem> they <END> 've put in  <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's the best dipping  <START:F_Ingredients> sauce <END>  ever.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was so good  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I felt indebted to the  <START:S_Staff> boss man <END>  for  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  wonderful  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  and volunteered to stay late. Perhaps  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  will be positive reinforcement and  <START:S_Staff> he <END> 'll buy me  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>  often.
Hands down the best  <START:Food> buffet <END>  on the strip. Wicked Spoon is amazing, but Baccahanal blows even  <START:F_FoodItem> them <END>  out of the  <START:F_Drinks> water <END> . I can't imagine coming to Vegas again and not eating  <START:Restaurant> here <END> .
Had  <START:Food> dinner <END>  at the  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> .
Stayed at Encore. Andrea's was the best  <START:Food> meal <END>  on our trip. The  <START:Service> service <END>  and the  <START:Food> food <END>  were the best. The rock  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> tempura <END>  and the mango  <START:F_Ingredients> avocado <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  were  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END> , and the strip  <START:F_FoodItem> steak <END>  with wasabi Demi glaze was also very good. Definitely coming back !
The  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  expert in me wants to cringe when I eat the  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> . LOL But I also know  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  I'm not in Japan or California, and  <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is probably better than most  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  places in Tempe.Well,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's better than Republic  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> ... if  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is saying much? However,  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's probably from the same  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  of Republic  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END> , the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  and the style is just too similar. And  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's just as expensive. I  <START:S_Delivery> ordered <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> .... no  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  was $8. Additional  <START:F_Ingredients> toppings <END>  are at least $1 per  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END> , and  <START:F_FoodItem> that <END>  is ridiculous.I don't know where these  <START:S_Staff> guys <END>  learned to make  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  but please.... no  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END> .  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  ruins the  <START:Food> texture <END>  and  <START:F_Ingredients>   flavor  . <END> of the  <START:F_FoodItem> broth <END> . I don't even want to ask why  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is  <START:F_Ingredients> corn <END>  available as a  <START:F_Ingredients> topping <END> . I'll just get annoyed. -______-Better off going back to Cherry Blossoms for  <START:S_Staff> their <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END>  (which actually  <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  like Japanese  <START:F_FoodItem> ramen <END> ).
Best Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  ever! I have been going to  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  for years and i love the new  <START:Restaurant> location <END> . The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> tastes <END>  just the same and I wish I could go  <START:F_FoodItem> every <END>  day.I always get the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  mango quesadilla.  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  is very popular for a reason ;)
 <START:Restaurant> this <END>  is my first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  coming  <START:Restaurant> here <END> ....I really am a fan of Gus' s  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> ...The  <START:Food> food <END>  is  <START:F_FI_Taste> delicious <END>  and customer  <START:Service> service <END>  is awesome.   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is fast and very clean!! Hope you get to enjoy Gus' s  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  soon!!!
Wow!  <START:Restaurant> this <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is absolutely incredible! I came in on a Thursday  <START:S_OpenHours> night <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END>  wasn't super packed, Senator Harry Reid had just came in with his wife to eat. One of the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  was so amazing and I had some of the best  <START:Service> service <END> . I split the Combo Special and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was so good, but did have a lot of  <START:Food> food <END> . We got complimentary  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  on the house and THE PITA  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  WAS UNBELIEVABLE!  <START:F_FoodItem> it <END> 's house made and cannot be missed. Definitely coming back for  <START:F_FI_Size> more <END> !!!
