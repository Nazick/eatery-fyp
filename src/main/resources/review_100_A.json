My fiance and I recently celebrated our anniversary at Canyon Cafe.  \n\nPro: The chips and salsa rock my world! The entree's are delicious! The staff is friendly and efficient.  The ambiance is quiet and relaxed.\n\nCon: The carnitas tacos are very greasy.\n\nCanyon Cafe exceeds our expectations every time.  You go for dinner but you stay for the chips and salsa.  The chip basket includes sweet potato, blue corn, wonton, and regular tortilla chips.  The salsa is roasted and heavenly.  \n\nRecommended: The bison burger, it is juicy and flavorful. The Verde Chicken enchiladas, love the sauce and chicken is tender.  The top shelf margarita, suggested to share but make sure to stir or the tequila will go straight to your head.\n\nCan't wait to go back.  It's our little secret place that we enjoy because it's quiet and we usually leave feeling quite euphoric.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}
