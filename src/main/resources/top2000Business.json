They refused me because it wasn't 4 Peaks branded.  I have 4 peaks growlers at home, but it was dirty, so we didn't grab it. When I asked 3 other local breweries what they would do in a similar situation, I was told they would replace the growler or simply fill it. \nI can understand not wanting to fill a blank growler but refuse me your product?

I ordered the Italian Beef Beer Bread and my boyfriend ordered Bleu Light Special Burger. We also shared a pint of the Hop Knot IPA. The beer was exquisite.

I also loooved my Italian Beef Beer Bread. It came in a wrap instead of sandwich.

Although my absolute FAVORITE is the Pumpkin Porter seasonal, in off season I'm happy with any of their beer, but usually stick with some Peach Ale. It gets crazy crowded on game days (of all sports and all teams) but always worth the wait. They have the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had. The servers are 100% hit or miss. Usually I have a great service, but occasionally I've had terrible service (bad servers but still great food/beer). Oh, and parking is kind of rough... but even then I cannot give this place less than 5 stars b/c of their consistent food and drinks. Oh! And Sunday Brunch... bloody marys and peak's mimosas.

On a busy night, they were nice enough to push tables together for us, clear our plates quickly and put candles on my birthday cake when the time came! \n\nPaying in big groups can sometimes be a headache, but they made it easy for us. When the time came to grab a taxi, they helped us with that too! \n\nLanding in a new city for your birthday can always be a little nerve wracking but I cannot imagine a place that would have been better at leaving everyone able to find something they could enjoy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

But even for 2 people, we still had to wait about 20 minutes on a chilly night. The wait was worth it though.\n\nIt's a very social restaurant and can also be a romantic place to take a date, as it's very dark inside, with hints of lights from the table to the walls.\n\nTheir stuff dates is really the business, that's all I can think about. My mouth is starting to water. Their mac and cheese hit close to home. And their paella was delish as well. Our other tapas was great but the dates and mac and cheese left a great impression. The portions are small which is great, because you get to try more things out on their menu. I loved, loved their complimentary bread and butter, their butter was different and my boyfriend isn't a big fan of things like that but he killed that before we even got to order. I was too shy to ask for seconds. I wish I could have ordered that to-go if the option was available.\n\nThey do get pretty crowded and I now understand why. As one table cleared, it was filled back up shorty after. I will definitely be back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

It only takes about 5 minutes (or less) from the Strip.\n\nWell, before I go on, let me tell you one disappointment.  They have a website and I've email them directly via their email box on their \"contact us\" page and asked a quick question if they're open on Christmas Day or not which seemed to be completely ignored.  If they cannot reply, they shouldn't even bother to put \"email us\" section...\n\nThat's been said, the rest of our Firefly experience was awesome.  Because they do not take reservations for smaller groups on weekends, we had to wait for about 15 minutes or so.  Once we're seated, we were greeted by a friendly waiter and other servers were attentive and helpful too.  \n\nWe didn't wait too much for drinks and food.  Red sangria was delicious.  Just between my sister and I, we ordered about 10 items and pretty much everything was yummy.  The best dish was one of their cheapest tapas, bacon wrapped stuffed dates ($4).  It was so good, we ordered another one.  Later we went to a fancy award winning restaurant and ordered their $10 bacon wrapped dates but Firefly's stuffed dates were far better than the fancy pricy restaurant's!  \n\nThe only so-so dish was their curry based mussels.  The coconut curry sauce and mussel combination didn't work for us.  However, it came with a couple of garlic toast and dipping it into the sauce was very delicious, so I can't say I didn't like it.  \n\nThere are many more dishes and drinks I want to try so I'll definitely go back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

Food was fantastic-I mean I had better tapas here than I did in Madrid, Spain.\n\nWanted to come back and swung on by on a Saturday night.  Real mistake on my part.  I didn't realize this was a hang-out place for the \"hip\" crowd.  OK, so I really detest the hip crowd but I didn't let this sway my opinion.\n\nI sat down at the bar and waited a bit and the bartender gave me a menu.  At the same time I ordered a glass of their red sangria which was recommended to me the 1st time and I really liked.  The red sangria is still really good.  So I perused the menu and it looked pretty much identical.  made a couple choices and waited.  Waited a bit more.  Finally the bartender comes to me and I mention that I haven't been here in 2 years.  Just as I was going to tell him my order he turns to help one of the waiters that comes up.  OK, np the bartender supports the waiters-I got this.  So I wait some more.  The bartender either completely forgets about me or ignores me.  I wait a while now, deciding to be a nice guy and try to give him another chance.  He takes someones else's order that walked up to the bar while I'm sitting at the bar.  I wait a good while and I'm finally feed-up.  Seriously?  I flip the menu over to see the price on my glass, put out exactly $6.50 for the drink on the bar and exit.  I was flabbergasted.  It's been a while since I've gotten this kind of treatment.  And the bar is really small.  There was me, and maybe 5 other people at this bar.  I'm thinking he just decided to blow me off.  Amazing.  I would have given this place 5 stars two years ago but now...\n\nMaybe in the future I'll revisit at lunchtime again and write an update for this place but until then, I guess I just wasn't hip enough for this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

Revisiting the past again.  I actually ate at Firefly for the first time years ago when my wife and I were visiting with our friends and were guided here by an old high school friend that lives in LV now.  Prior to eating at Firefly, my wife and I had never had Tapas.  Being in town for CES last weekend with the same friends that came the first time, they requested to revisit Firefly for a dinner and we obliged.\n\nWhen my wife found out that they wanted to come back, she had a feeling of discomfort associated with the restaurant that should couldn't really place the reason behind at the time.  But as soon as we walked in, it came back to her; she didn't like sitting at the lounge table.  For those of you who have not been before, be aware that there is a bar, a set of normal tables with chairs and booth seats, and then a number of tables surround by low couches that require leaning over a lot to eat.  We requested a normal dining table this time to appease her, and it made all the difference.\n\nWhen we arrived on Thursday night after our first day at CES, it was already pretty hopping.  We put our names down for a table and went to the bar.  I remembered having the Sangria last time, but didn't remember how good it was.  I asked the bar tender if I could try the red wine Sangria (effectively ordering it), but then he actually made a mini version of the drink with fruit bits and all for me to try it.  I then asked to try the white and champagne Sangrias (meeting more and more resistance each time, understandably) before ordering the champagne version.  The fact that he was wiling to let me sample all three was greatly appreciated.  Great bar tender.  My wife ordered a Mojito (so-so), and then a couple caramel apple martinis because they blew her away.  Highly recommended.\n\nSoon we were told a table was available for us and we sat at a comfortable, standard table.  Here is what we ordered (that I can recall) and our impressions:\n\nShrimp ceviche - Nice shrimp, but way too citrusy (sour).\n\nStuffed dates - A great blend of sweet and savory (dates + bacon).\n\nFrench Fries - A great filler. Shoestring with Parmesan and herbs. Ask for aioli to dip in.\n\nManchego Mac 'n Cheese - A favorite for my wife (the mac 'n cheese connoisseur).  Very good and cheesy.\n\nTerra y Mare Skewers - Tasty and good quality filet, shrimp, and chorizo.\n\nChicken and Chorizo stuffed mushrooms - Sizzling awesomeness.  They're hot when they first come out, so be careful.\n\nLamb skewers - Very good and tender.\n\nFried calamari - I don't like squid, so I didn't really partake, but the other three said it was very good.\n\nCamarones a la diabla - Shrimp with a nice kick and a smoky sauce.  Good stuff.\n\nChocolate Tres Leches Cake - Amazing! Melts in your mouth. No chewing necessary.  Super soft and moist.  Drooling...\n\nWith the 10 entrees and multiple rounds of drinks, you'd think the bill would be nuts, but it was around $150 total, which is perfectly reasonable for 4 people given the quality, variety, and quantity.  I recommend you check this place out if you want a great tapas experience.  There's a nice cigar bar in the same strip mall, too.\n\nSummary: Great food. Very reasonable prices.  High quality.  Full bar.  Lots of parking.  Place gets hopping at night, so come early or plan for a wait.  Great bar service and drinks.  Lounge seating and normal tables.  Lounge seats require leaning forward a lot.  Highly recommended restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

I've been anxious to try this place since ever since.  I didn't care about doing anything else in Sin City this time around... I just had to try this place out!  \n\nThey start you off with bread, butter, and some olives.  The butter was sweet and silky; if it could keep it's form for a few hours, I'd like some to go.  I'd be snacking on bread and butter all day long. \n\nWe ordered the paella, stuffed dates, tuna tartare w/ taro chips, and lamb kabobs on top of lentils.  The tuna tartare was fresh and lightly seasoned, which went well with the clean and crisp flavors of the taro chips.  The dates were definitely a highlight.  No need to go into lengthy detail--they are as good... as great... as everyone describes them!  If I were to ever host an event or even someday get married, stuffed dates would be on the menu!   The lamb was tasty and the lentils were evenly cooked.  I had to take baby bites thinking that our paella was coming out.  However, we find out that our server didn't take that order down.  (Boo.. minus one star.)  He said it would take 10 minutes; so I impulsively told my bf to order another dish to fill the 10 minute void.  (We could've just eaten the kabobs, but like most Asians, we'd rather have our protein with rice.)  So, he ordered the steamed mussels.  I thought steamed would mean boring.  But boy, was I wrong.  Another solid dish!  The red broth or sauce the mussels were soaked in was freaking awesome!  (They can have their one star back.)  I couldn't quite pick out the flavors, but I did taste some ginger.  Sometimes ginger can be a bit overpowering, but this was nice and subtle.  And then our paella finally came.  The paella, which had a combo of clams, mussels, chicken and chorizo, was good, but by the time it came out, we were stuffed.  We=me+bf.  We caved in to gluttony, but felt no remorse.\n\nWith Firefly's nice play on texture and awesome flavors, this was truly an unforgettable dining experience.

A tiny bit gamy, but I still gobbled it up.\n\nOVERALL: a fun place to snack a bit before an epic night of partying, or just chilling for the night.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

Sangria is $6.5 a glass or $26 a pitch normally. They also have Mojito's in a variety of flavors, $7 a glass or $28 a pitcher. So during happy hour those prices are so great! \n\nYou start out by getting a garlic bread, green olives and almond butter. Oh that almond butter is to DIE for!!

(You can ask for more bread of you ate it all with your almond butter)\n\nTierra y Mara- Skewers of shrimp, filet, and chorizo with a spicy green salsa. \n\nStuffed Dates- Date with a smoked almond in the middle wrapped in BACON! Served with a red wine reduction.  People forget to add that they are ALMONDS in the middle.... I think that's what makes it great, other than the bacon of course! Another thing to use your bread for.'\n\nPadron Peppers- These are under the hot tapas menu, but they're a great appetizer too. These spicy little babies are either grilled or baked to give them a slight char to them. Served with lemon, and sooner than you know it you'll want to order another plate. \n\nOther things I have tried, Manchego mac n cheese, empanadas both the veggie and meat, baked tetilla, lamb skewers, firefly fish sticks, and too many more to remember.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

I eat out, alot. I frequent new and old establishments.\nI eat mom and pop all the way to joel robuchon.\nI give everyone a fair chance, and probably me being in the industry is not going to help this review at all, however...\n\nUpon entering Firefly last night, there was no greeter for 4 minutes in a small lobby area that had no one present but myself and my girlfriend.\nWhen the hostess finally sat us, we waited 10 minutes before anyone remotely attended to us. When that person came, it was for bread on the table. Then....the wait, another 10 minutes and still no service,even for drinks.\nWhen my girlfriend spoke up, it was to another server who took our drink order AND our tapas selections. He told us, this was not his section, however..he put the order in and informed us that our \"server\" would be taking us through the remainder of our meal.\nWe Thanked him and soon after, our plates arrived, rather quickly I might add.\nI must say, I am glad we only ordered 5 plates. Everything was either a fried element or had some sort of fried item in the food. \nAt best, it was \"ok\". \n\nThe Thai beef Salad tasted boring. No real essence of Thai at all. The beef almost tasted poached with no char,which could be from the over saturation of dressing. The dressing itself needed something to balance the acidity,perhaps a sweetness [which I am assuming was the purpose of the pickled ginger, is that even really \"Thai\"]\nAnd the crispy wonton was over exposed and just way to much.\n\nThe empanada ..all I can say is Shame On You! Creme Cheese? Really?\n\nThe duck rolls were constructed as if it were rillette , almost a puree.\nIf, and I do stress, it was supposed to be that way, I would suggest learning to confit.\n\nThe croquette seemed like fried potato soup with cheese. No real evidence of any ham whatsoever.\n\nAbout the only thing really \"decent\" was the tempura. Sauce was nice and not to overpowering with citrus segments in it. However, the green onions were left to soak in the grease for way to long and almost tasted burnt.\n\nAll the while of eating, I noticed the heavier set man who I am assuming is the FOH manager roaming. He spent most of his time however at a table, picking up a child and speaking to one table and that table alone. Not realizing what his staff is doing.\n\nNow, back to the lack of service. Our waiter who \"should\" have been giving us service in the first place finally arrived at plate number 4.\nHe saw that most of the plates were left un eaten and suggested that he \"pack\" the food up in a to go box. We declined. He never asked us how our meal was or even why there was an abundance of food left.\nYou would think someone would get 2 + 2.\n\nIt was also a little strange that when the \"original\" order taker asked if my girlfriend wanted a refill on her drink and the busboy delivered it, he prepared to take my beer away in replace,yet, my girlfriends glass was empty [ o , did I mention that I never received the option for a beer glass and just received a bottle], then..the bussboy brought another drink to the table after that. Two drinks in a confusing fashion were delivered. At this point, I was at my limit.\n\nThere are smaller points I could make, but I believe I am getting my point across. \nFirefly, this is my second visit.

Get some extra bread and mop up the sauce.\nShrimp ceviche-  Large chunks of shrimp, avocado, diced onions and bell pepper tossed in lime juice and served with tortilla strips.\nStuffed dates- Dates stuffed with almonds, wrapped in bacon, fried crispy, garnished with goat cheese and parsley. \n\nIf it was not 12:30pm... who am I kidding, if I wasn't driving, I would have been drinking. Remember kids, don't drink and drive. Make someone else be the DD. Their red and white sangrias are delicious. The best part of the drunken state comes from eating the fermented fruit floating around. After a few, it becomes a game to catch them all. Firefly's mojitos are amazing as well. My personal favorite are the mango or blood orange.  Even though it is a rum drink, that uses simple syrup, the fruit juices don't make it overbearingly sweet.\n\nThe real disappointment lies in the desserts. I use to love this place for their banana nutella sandwiches and the chocolate tres leches cake, but the former was lacking immensely today. For one, there was hardly any banana in the sandwiches and they were cooked so dry that I needed to ladle the nutella onto it. Don't get me wrong, I would drink nutella, but I want to have the choice to go without it and that was taken away from me. The tres leches cake was delicious, but did it get smaller? Since coming back to Vegas, this has been the first time I looked at a dish and said, \"WTF, where is my food?\".\n\nI should have gone with my first instinct and gone to the Lunch Box for their waffle ice cream sandwich.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

I just determined that I'm not a huge fan of Spanish cuisine thus far (paella is good though...). That being said, I do like small dishes as a concept and Firefly executes this so well without coming off with an ounce of pretentiousness.\n\nThis place is very laid back - visually, it has more in common with a nicer bar than a fine dining establishment. But don't let that fool you, the quality of the food here is top notch. Keep in mind though, it lies in a small strip mall with minimal parking, so brush up on your parking lot stalking skills or take a cab.\n\nHere, Firefly offers a wide variety of food in tapas form, but doesn't constrain itself to traditional tapas fare, which worked out perfectly for me. There's also French, American, Thai, and Chinese-inspired dishes here too. We had a decent-sized party, and we went to town here: bacon wrapped dates, french-style mushroom tarts, lamb skewers, filet mignon sliders, the list goes on. There is something for everyone here and everything they did, they did well.\n\nI will happily suggest and introduce this place to others next time I come back to Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8buIr1zBCO7OEcAQSZko7w"}

There's gazpacho (my fave), patatas bravas (minus the aioli), some salads that can have the cheese left off, a lentil dish, and a large plate pasta.  You can fill up if you get three or four of these, but your socks will remain firmly on your feet.  \n\nThe service varies - sometimes great, sometimes pretty bad, usually in between.

After moving here four years ago, I decided to give it a try.  My first visit was fairly good.  The place was packed.  The decor plain with tons of celebrities on the wall.\n\nMy second visit was probably two years ago.  I went with my boyfriend on a date night.  I decided to try some of the more interesting stuff, like tripe, etc.  Of course I was the only one eating these items as my boyfriend is a burger and fries kind of guy.  I think he ordered the Pad Thai.  I made him try a couple of bites.  I'm not sure what I ordered but it was good going down.\n\nA perfect date is not complete without a walk by the Bellagio fountain, which I insisted on.  However, not ten minutes after dinner, I warned my boyfriend that we needed to find a bathroom NOW!  My stomach hurt so badly I was afraid I wasn't going to make it.  We stopped at the first bathroom after the Bellagio self-park as I sat on the toilet balled over in pain.  We walked through the casino and I ran into the bathroom again only minutes later.  We caught a quick fountain show and I ran into the bathroom again.  That's three trips in ten minutes.  I'm sure the security guards thought I had a different \"problem\".  After we made it home, my boyfriend finally got going and spent a good part of the night in the bathroom.  Talk about pain.\n\nI'm not sure what I had eaten that had caused the upset stomach and, I have to say, I was really disappointed.  I will try it again but if I spend another night in the bathroom . . .", "type": "review", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA"}

And if you read about the Vegas food scene Lotus of Siam is probably a name you've come across as well. People talk about it as the best Thai restaurant not just in Vegas or Nevada but in the entire United States. For a city that's known for big billings and flashy signs this is quite a statement.\n\nA group of me and my buddies checked it out for dinner. The menu is a tome filled with both Thai classics as well as dishes I've never seen before. Some things we wanted we couldn't find on the menu (like a Spring roll) but we were able to order anyways, I'm not sure if we just couldn't find it or if they cater to this off the menu ordering but given what they say they can make I'm sure it would be pretty hard to stump this kitchen.\n\nNothing at this place jumped out as the greatest Thai food I've ever had. They were pretty honest about their spice ratings with several \"moderate\"-ly spicy dishes coming out as quite hot. I really love my food spicy and found moderate to be about right, although I have to admit, I'd love to come back and ask for something really spicy and see what they'd serve up. For my main dish I went with the Nam-Prik-Head (Spicy Mushroom Dip) because (1) as previously noted, I like spice, and (2) I never remember seeing this on a menu before. What came out was a small dish of \"dip\" and some vegetables. The dip doesn't really stick to the vegetables as it as more of the consistency of a thick chutney than a dip. It wasn't the easiest dish to eat but it as definitely spicy and a very tasty mixture.\n\nThe service here as quite slow, not bad, they were friendly and helpful, just in no rush to get anywhere and we often found ourselves waiting. The restaurant is in a strip mall a little off the Strip. A local friend who came to meet us after dinner wanted to know what we were doing in \"that\" part of town, which says a lot in Vegas. Walking the distance from the strip won't kill you, but the neighborhood just might. \n\nIn sum, if this is the best Thai food in the US the reason is only because it's one of the only ones that serves \"real\" Thai food and the rest of them are holding out on us. I've never been to Thailand so I can't really comment on that. Although excellent food, it wasn't quite cheap enough to be cheap, not hidden enough to be a hidden gem and just not good enough to make me think it's the best Thai food I'll ever taste in the states. Worth going to but I wouldn't say that it's a \"must visit.\"", "type": "review", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA"}

I haven't been to enough to compare, but my first time experience with Lotus of Siam is pretty damn good. \n\nWhen we rolled up, we had an awkward feeling about this place as the exterior seemed really dinky and the spaces around this strip mall have pretty much gone out of business. But as we saw people waiting around in the front for it to open....and asian, this was our good sign. It was like the moment Dorothy opened the front door to her house and stepped into Oz. They had seemed to done up the place really well and you really wouldn't have imagined it at its location.\n\nIt was pretty interesting as we sat down and literally had to flip through seven pages of the menu and absolutely had no idea what to order. The waiters were definitely honest with their suggestions. Their recommendations turned out to be some of the most unique flavors and tastes I've ever experienced.  I'm thinking that part of the reason why their food is so delicious is because they utilize their different flavors, textures, and consistencies so successfully.\n\nWe ordered the following:\nNam Kao Tod\nGreen Tofu Curry \nSai Oua (Northern Style Sausage)\nDrunken Noodles with Chicken\nNam Prik Ong with Sticky Rice (Red Chili Dip)\nCoconut Ice cream with Fried Bananas \n\nAmongst my uncle, cousin and myself, it was definitely way too difficult to rank our favorites; and we kept adding on to our tab because it's one of those places where you want to literally try everything on the menu.\n\nWe also kept hearing people mention that they had redone the place, maybe for more room to hang their awards and pictures of celebrities.\n\nChances of coming back?

I just had Thai food the other day and most of the time I don't like repeating similar types of food for at least a few days/meals.. BUT Thai Noodle House left such a savory taste in my mouth that I wanted More!! BUT More from a new place, a place that so many people seem to worship! This place doesn't seem to lure in just us locals but also the rich and famous! I'm ready for Thai food Round 2:\n\nWhat gave me a New Outlook on Thai Food:\n\nGround Chicken Larb: ground chicken with chopped onion, green chili, lime juice and fresh cabbage\n\n- Tried this because it was recomended. Quite Fresh, Limey, Crunchy (cabbage) and Chicken was Good. And Most importantly Spicey!! for me at least.. We opted for 4/10 (default, if you don't mention how spicy, you get thir medium hot which starts at 4 Not 5) on the heat scale and this already made me feel like a fire breathing dragon!! Don't be fooled, if your not into spicy you may want to order a 3 at most. For comparison: I've tried a 10/10 heat scale at Pin Kaow and Thai BBQ.. The 4 here was hotter! \n\nDrunken Noodle Sliced Chicken: pan fried flat noodle, topped with sauteed chicken, fresh and dry chili, thai basil on a bed of greens\n\n- My girl doesn't really eat seafood, so she substituted for chicken. I thought I've tried Great Thai flat noodle chicken dishes in the past but boy was I wrong! Chicken Tender and Very Tasty, Herbs and Spices (3/10 heat) was just right and flat noodles couldn't be any better! \n\nPad Se-Ew Sliced Pork: stir-fried flat rice noodle with egg, chinese broccoli and black soy sauce\n\n- One of my favorite all time Thai dishes. I never tried a bad version of this dish but their pork here was better than any I've tried and again the flat noodles stood out themselves. 4/10 heat scale but didn't seem to have as much heat as the Chicken Larb dish?.. Really Good for Pad Se-ew.\n\nDrunken Noodle Halibut: deep fried halibut filet with homemade fresh chili and thai basil, over pan fried flat noodles\n\n- Best Thai dish I've Ever Had.. Period. I don't know where to start.. The fish fillet had a nice breading, lightly fried and was flaky fresh. Their blend of chilis/herbs/spices blend were Unreal!!!! All on top of their pan fried flat noodles! By now you should know how I feel about their flat noodles! I ordered this at a 5/10 thinking it wouldn't be too much heat but it was blazing! Next time I would order this at a 3 but it was So Magically Delicious,  it didn't matter!!\n\nThai Iced Tea:\n\n- Great way to subside the heat from the food! Had a stronger flavor than usual.\n\nCoconut Ice Cream:\n\n- Very Fresh Islandy Flavor! If you have room for it, Try It!\n\nAfter having Homemade Thai food and Several Thai restaurants, I think its safe to for me to consider this place the Mecca of Thai Food!  The drunken noodle halibut  revolutionized the way I view Thai Cuisine. My experience here was Insanely Satisfying I wanted to give my waiter a Hug!!!!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA"}

It's definitely tasty, but I would rather save space for trying more dishes.\n\nAll in all, the food was absolutely amazing and this is what this place is all about. Kudos for them.

The waitress was nice enough to get him a drink for free to help get rid of the spiciness.\n\nIf you plan on going make a reservation 2-3 days before to be safe. We had a group of 15 people and tried to make a reservation the day of which was a bad idea, but luckily we put our name down and gave them our phone number and they called us after about an hour to tell us our table was ready.\n\nIf you visit Vegas there is no reason to not go to this place, by far some of the best food I have ever had.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA"}

Hence Google, and Yelp and Urbanspoon, etc which is how I found out about Lotus of Siam.\nSo, lengthy introduction in a nutshell; thank you other Yelpers for talking this place up.\n\nSo, here's what happens; you dress up in your best Las Vegas attire for a flashy night out on the town. Second; you pull into one of the shittiest strip mall parking lots out there and start to wonder where the hell you are. Third; you triple check your smart phone to make sure that there's not more than one Lotus of Siam and maybe you ended up at the bad one....\n\nDear skeptical eater; You are at the right place! now get out of your car and go cram into the packed waiting area.\n\nWhich is exactly what we did last night. Monday night, the place is packed, waiting area to capacity, people spilling out into the street, every table taken. \nAnd then you eat here, and you know why this is.\n\nThe meal we ate here was amazing! and since you are off the strip it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

That pretty much sums up Lotus of Siam (LOS) for me. \n\nSince moving out to Las Vegas a few years ago, I have always heard about LOS, but have never ventured out to give them a try.  And when I finally went with a group of Meetup folks, the overall experience was positive.\n\nLOS is a Thai restaurant that does truly deserves the many accolades that has been given by food critics, from the ranks of professionals to amateurs, from all around the world over the years.  The restaurant features a fairly large menu selection, some are common and easy to find on other menus, but more importantly it has entr\u00e9es and specials that are not available in most other Thai restaurants in the US.  \n\nNow, I am not saying every dish that is prepared and served from the kitchen is perfect and absolutely delicious, because it is not.  But out of the thirteen we ordered, there was only one I did not really cared for, most are good, and some are truly excellent.  Some items I thought was overpriced, while others I felt deserves the price charged.\n\nFood highlights:\nPrawn Ocha - Unique preparation of an otherwise common ingredient.  Delicious and highly recommended.  It is pricey, but definitely worth trying at least once. ($21.95)\n\n#116 Drunken Noodle Seafood - Pan fried flat rice noodle\ntopped with, sauteed assorted seafood with fresh & dry chili,\nThai basil served on bed of green. ($12.95)\n\nDesserts!  Their Fried Banana Roll is a little different from those served elsewhere, their Mango and Sticky Rice (the mango was surprisingly ripe and tasty for March, while the sticky rice was just A+), the Coconut Ice Cream was good.\n\nHits The Spot:\n#130 Green Curry with Sliced Chicken. Nothing fancy, but is still good. ($9.95) \n\n#85  Spicy Catfish with Basil Leaves - Saut\u00e9ed deep fried thin catfish slice without bone in fresh and dried chili and Thai basil leaves. ($13.95)\n\nDislikes:\n#14 Nam Kao Tod (Crispy Rice Salad with Minced Sour Sausage) - not particularly interesting, and way too much lime for my taste.  Although others on Yelp, ChowHound, etc raves about it. So give it a try, and decide for yourself.\n\nService - Acceptable.  We had a large party of 11, and they did their best to provide decent level of service.  The kitchen was also able to space out the timing of serving the dishes, otherwise there will definitely not be any room to put everything we ordered on the two tables they put together to seat our group.\n\nRecommended group size: Small parties of 1-2, 3-4, or 7or 8 (small 2 tops, 4 tops, or 2x 4 tops). Anything larger, you will just be squeezed into tables that should seat 8 comfortably. \n\nMake reservations in advance!  Especially if you have a large group.\n\nFood: 3.5 - some hits and some misses. The noodles all seems to be good to great.\nService: 3 - probably provides better service for smaller and more manageable parties.\nAmbiance: 4.5 - It is brightly lit, which I prefer, so I can see my food and how artfully it has been presented.\nPrice: 3 - Some items seems overpriced, while others deserved the markup.  Our party average $32/person (no wine), and we were able to try a lot of food.\n\nIf I can give it a 3.5 I would, because it is better than just \"A-OK\", but not really good enough for the \"Yay! I'm a fan\".", "type": "review", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA"}

We sat down and ordered a few beers, then took a look at the extensive menu.\n\nWe decided to order family style. \n\nChicken and Shrimp Pad Thai- No doubt the best pad thai I've ever had. Perfect amount of spice and so much flavor.\n\nPad See Ew- Once again, the best Pad See Ew I've ever had. So much flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The beef was perfect with it.\n\nTom Yum Kai- The broth was delicious, but my mouth was on fire! I must have taken a spoon full of spices at one time because I was dying. Still real good though.\n\nCrispy Duck on Drunken Noodle- By far my favorite dish of the night. The duck was cooked perfectly and the added crispy on top from the fat just made it amazing. One of the best things I have eaten all year.\n\nOverall I was really impressed with Lotus of Siam. THere was an extremely high amount of hype going into the dinner and the dinner did not disappoint.

A big restaurant clean inside that looks nothing like the horrible outside. Service is really attentive and makes sure your table is always clean. \n\nThe food here was superb. Next time I come here I'm only ordering the specialty dishes. The typical dishes are great but they have such an awesome menu that every dish we got blew my mind. The tom yum kai soup is delicious and you can't go wrong with that. The pad thai they use thin noodles which made me like it even more! The sea bass drunken noodles was crack. The fish itself was so tender it was like butter. The green curry was another highligh that felt like eating coconut butter on top of rice. I couldn't get enough of it. The raw beef tar tar was light and fresh. The fried rice was good but probably the least memorable of the dishes. Next time I come here I'm getting the deep fried prawns.

When a restaurant is heralded as the best Thai food in North America, it has to be good. Only down side was my expectations going in were sky high. However it really says something when not only was I not let down but my expectations were actually exceeded. \nI've heard that everything on the menu is great and so far that's true although some things are a bit more amazing than others. I've been here twice so far, and both times have ordered number #14 on the appetizer menu. I can't remember the exact name of it but I refer to it as crispy rice salad. One of the best dishes I can remember getting in a long time. \nThe menu is very long and has a bigger variety than most typical Thai restaurants so you might need some guidance. On my first visit, the server recommended Sea Bass Drunken Noodles. I saw a prior reviewer mention it was \"like crack\" and I would have to agree with them. The Sea Bass was very tender and the noodles and sauce were very flavorful. The next time I came, I forced myself to try something different. The server recommended some sort of noodle dish that was more like soup. It was still good but I definitely preferred the drunken noodles to it. But really, seems like you can't go wrong with almost anything here.\nWe actually tried to come to Lotus of Siam several years ago but we thought we were in the wrong place since the center its in looks a bit run down, to put it nicely. So if you have never been here, be forewarned. Once you enter however, the place looks legit. Take a glance at all the pictures of celebrities and famous chefs who have dined here to convince you.\nMy only complaint is that they are not open for lunch on weekends. Since its location is a bit out of the way, it's more convenient to come to for lunch and I would guarantee I'd be here on every Vegas trip if I could come in for lunch on a Saturday or Sunday. On my last week Vegas trip, I literally scheduled my trip around a lunch visit here by going on a long weekend and staying through Monday. I won't always have that option though so unfortunately I'll probably miss out on the deliciousness of Lotus of Siam on some future trips to the desert.", "type": "review", "business_id": "lliksv-tglfUz1T3B3vgvA"}

The fried rice that I ordered with basil, tofu and vegetables was done right. The flavors were adequate and of good taste. Fried rolls for appetizer were standard fare but not too fried which is good. Just the right amount of crisp.

Okay, for the record, it took us for-ever to find it in the casino, our fault for not being able to navigate I suppose.\n\nFood: Obviously known for their burgers, the range of flavors starts with a run-of-the-mill cheeseburger, to a fine dining Rossini Burger (Kobe burger, sauteed foie gras, shaved truffles, and a rich brown sauce). I settled somewhere in the middle with a Bacon, Cheddar Kobe burger. Very juicy, great bread (a choice of 4), and well-seasoned onion rings. Fries were also really good (offered thick or thin). But the coup de grace was their shake. A nutella shake. NUTELLA....SHAKE. It's freakin genius and I have no idea why it's not sold everywhere. It originally was suppose to have chocolate ice cream. When I asked the waitress which shake I should get, she suggested the Nutella shake, but with vanilla ice cream. Let me tell you....I will be forever grateful to that waitress. Possibly the best shake I've ever had. Rich, creamy, topped with a chocolate whipped cream and garnished with hazelnuts. Friends also had some alcoholic shakes, which were also really great. \n\nService: Awesome service. Aside from the life-altering choice my waitress helped me with, the servers were good about keeping our glasses filled and coming around every once in a while to check on us. \n\nOverall: I wish there was one near San Diego, alas, to eat at a Burger Bar you must be in Vegas, St. Louis, or San Francisco. But a great restaurant, with awesome service. Oh, did I mention there was a tv in our booth? No? There was. It was awesome.

The wife added a fried egg which was done right (a little runny yolk in the center, not like fatburger where it's over cooked). Made the burger more rich.

Meat is very flavorful and juicy but you might still be hungry afterward. 3 sliders doesn't necessarily fill up a growing boy.\n\nAs for the fries, sweat potato fries are good.  The regular fries on the other hand were great.  They look like Burger King's fries, but are fantastic, thin, crispy, crunchy all the way through (not greasy at all).  I am a fan!\n\nPS.

In fact, many Yelpers I respect and normally agree with love this place but man, I haven't felt this ripped off since I bought my HDDVD player. \n\nMaybe Im biased against these so-called \"gourmet burger\" spots.  I mean, what makes a hamburger great is that its approachable by everyone, regardless of economics.  Perhaps thats why it has come to be synonymous with America...that it crosses boundaries.   Not here however, these burgers are decidedly expensive and in reality no better than anything you'd find at your favorite local burger joint.  \n\nJust because you use the word \"kobe\" or \"danish blue cheese\" doesn't mean you have the right to charge $20 bucks for a burger...but apparently here it does.  Another thing is one would think a gourmet burger place would have gourmet fries right?  Wrong...here the fries were so mediocre I was yearning for Chili's.......yep, thats right I said Chili's and now I must shower to wash the shame off my body.  \n\nI had Hubert's favorite burger which was composed of Buffalo, Bleu Cheese and sherry shallot reduction sauce.  It tasted ok, but the price...oh that price!  Would you spend 15 bucks for a gourmet hot dog?  You would tell me to jump off a bridge!  My mom had the sliders and reported them as being ok as well, but nothing special.\n\nService was average but not very friendly.  I mean I would have a smile if I was getting a 10 dollar tip for bringing out two hamburgers and a couple soda pops but who am I to judge?\n\nOne positive thing to note was Burger Bar did have a nice beer selection with some unique options at decent prices.  Its nice to be free from the normal yoke of beer oppression perpetrated by the casinos.\n\nI for one can pass on this place again but judging by the crowd there and the reviews on Yelp, most people disagree.....Twilight Zone I tells ya!!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "xyTJYlbE_MLouK6rCou6zg"}

The first time I had seen the place featured on a travel show and thought the idea was pretty cool.  You basically get to pick from a huge list of options to create your perfect hamburger -- everything from different meats, toppings, breads, and extras.  If you want a Kobe beef burger topped with lobster tail, yes you can get it here.  If you want a turkey burger with avocado, they've got it too.  So they've got the quantity, but I really think they lack in quality.  Don't get me wrong - the burger tastes good.  And damnit, if you don't like one of the toppings, it is kind of your fault for picking that.  But really, when it comes down to it, the burger just isn't amazing or spectacular like I'd expect from a Vegas burger joint.  The sides aren't anything to write home about either.  Their prices can quickly add up too since each topping comes with an additional charge.  So in the end, Burger Bar gets a 3-star rating.

Despite all the seats, BB does get crowded, especially during lunch, dinner, or the weekends. This place has TV screens everywhere, in every booth, along the wall at the sit down bar, and a few others placed throughout the place. It's more like a sports burger bar...I like seeing ESPN on the screens, I'm a guy, it's in my DNA! The crappy thing I don't like is that they pump music through their speakers and since music is loud, people also speak louder. Don't expect to have a nice quiet conversation with your date or friends...this ain't the place for that.\n\nThe menu is simple. You can pick one of  their set menu items or create your own burger. Reasonable priced menu especially for the LV Strip. You can choose from different meats...Black Angus, Country Natural, American Kobe, & Buffalo. For you other people not looking for meats...they have a veggie burger, chicken, salmon, or turkey. Then you can dress it up with whatever veg, cheese, or sauces, on their lists. And you can get your burgers with fries (fat, skinny, or sweet potato), buttermilk Zucchini fries or onion rings, & beer battered jalapeno pickles (never tried these). I usually keep it simple: Kobe beef on a sesame seed bun with grilled onions & spinach, with sweet potato fries or onion rings, & a $7 chocolate shake (yes I did just order a $7 shake!). The wife likes the Surf & Turf- black angus burger, grilled half lobster, & asparagus. They also have a $60 Rossini Burger-kobe, foie gras, black Perigord truffles, on an onion bun...pretty steep for a burger but if it floats your boat-eat it.\n\nThey also have a pretty good selection of beers, wines, and cocktails. Beer is beer everywhere except when it comes to the prices and BB alcohol prices are higher than other similar food joints. We always pass on the drinks. \n\nFor the most part we've had decent service. But we do avoid the lunch and dinner crowds because those are the times we've had hit or miss service. It's mayhem trying to wave down a server during a weekend dinner rush. And it seems like they play extra loud music to help to drown out the customers that need assistance LOL! Seriously, you can hear ESPN, loud music, people talking loud just to hear themselves...and that's going on all at once. BB has the unmistakable ambiance of a high school cafeteria.\n\nOverall, BB is fun burger joint where you can create your \"OWN\" masterpiece of a burger. We like that they offer you many different selections of toppings, but beware on your add on's, they can definitely add up. You could easily be eating a $20+ burger.

We wanted to pay the big bucks for a great tasting burger.

Tables, booths and music, this is a long and narrow restaurant, but plenty of room.\n\nService - Not bad, not great. Made a few mistakes on the orders, but overall, decent.\n\nPresentation - Food is kinda slopped onto a large plate, and if you order without fries on each plate , and choose to say, share fries with everyone, then the kitchen hasn't a clue how to make the plates look half empty with only the burger on it. I find that to be odd for a 20.00 burger. Yeah, put it on a huge plate and make it look like you paid a lot for a little.\n\nFood - Good taste overall for sure.  Definitely interesting to either order pre-made combinations or order everything on your own.  However, the taste is okay, not mind blowing.\n\nPrice - Very expensive for the quality.  I would have to be careful when I come back, because I will not frequent this place. Getting to it is a challenge since you are going to go to a casino, park, walk and walk and walk...... For the money, without the club type atmosphere you can go to Grind Burger on Trop and it is as good or slightly better.\n\nOverall - Good experience, glad I tried it. Would bring clients, but not sure if I would come back with the family.\n\nFamily note - Don't let your kids go to the bathroom alone. Seems that the toilets are in the restaurant, which make it safe, but the fact is the signs bring you to an exit door and you exit the rear of the restaurant and you are in the back of the public mall where anyone and everyone has access.  The door from this public area to the restaurant is open and so, BE CAREFUL.  This is a disaster waiting to happen!  Very poor security.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xyTJYlbE_MLouK6rCou6zg"}

My last visit to Vegas I ended up only at the bar as I forgot to make reservations so my boyfriend and I just came for mojitos. Yes, just mojitos. And you know what, they're worth the $14 a piece for them.\n\nSo over the years this place has progressively increased their prices which sucks, but the quality of food has always been top-notch. Plus, it's rare that I have good Tex-Mex cuisine. What I get is always California washed out Mexican food. This is a fantastic change while keeping the integrity of so many familiar ingredients.\n\nMy favorite appetizers are a tie between the goat cheese queso fondidu and the the blue corn pancake with BBQed duck. Now, many years ago the queso fondidu used to be melted goat cheese with a poblano salsa which I actually preferred over the rajas they serve with it now. That's just my personal preference though, but I still really like it a lot. With the blue corn pancake I've had inconsistencies with the amount of duck, and how they've plated it. Mixed in --- or sliced on top --- I'm assuming maybe it was just the quality of the duck, or from where they got the meat from. Breasts slice nicely, so that goes on top. Thigh not so much, so that get mixed in? Ok. Still good. I love duck in any way, so no complaints on my end taste-wise.\n\nFrom the most current menu, I'd have to say the pan roasted venison is my favorite and a close second would be the New Mexico spiced pork tenderloi. I've never ordered the 16 spice chicken however I've had it a couple of times over the years from picking off of other people's plates and the chicken has always been consistently good and never dry. \n\nThere used to be a spiced steak on the menu a long time ago and I wish they'd bring that back. :( The last two times I haven't ordered a steak so I don't know if any of the new steaks even compare. The ribeye looked fantastic, maybe next time I will order that. \n\nI'm sure next time I'm in Vegas I'll be back again, like I always am, even if it's just for a mojito.

But the food reviews here are so mixed, I was a bit hesitating to spend my money even for lunch at Mesa Grill in Vegas.  My sister and I were too tired to find a better place, we decided to try our first Bobby Flay food.\n\nWe were there for Sunday Brunch around noon after Christmas and we're seated right away.  Our server was not bad but for some reason he had this weird energy and we didn't feel completely relaxed around him.  \n\nWe wanted to have their fruit juice but we're told they were all out.  All three juices (orange, grapefruit and carrot/orange)!  That surprised me because as a restaurant by a very well known chef at this very popular hotel, I would expect them to have a decent inventory skill.  We're very disappointed and ordered cactus pear iced tea instead.  It wasn't bad but nothing special about it. \n\nThe warm bread basket had three different baked goodies.  The first one on top was almost like a soft chewy cookie with raisins and nuts.  I don't think it goes with any of their main dishes but as itself, it was very yummy and I wished I had that one after my lunch as a dessert.  I can't describe the second mini soft pretzel-ish thingy but I can say they were good.  And the bottom in the basket was a cornbread which was made with half yellow and half blue corn and had some corn, bell peppers and some chili pepper slices in it.  It was delicious.  Our waiter just dropped the basket off on our table but at the end of our brunch, I saw a different waiter at other table was explaining what they were to his guests.  The ladies at our next table were chatting pretty loud so I couldn't hear a thing but wished our waiter did the same for us. \n\nI ordered their honey glazed salmon and my sister ordered the pork tenderloin sandwich.  My salmon was very thick but cooked perfectly and was very moist.  The honey glaze and the black bean sauce were delicious and my sister loved her sandwich too.  I had a bite and the pork was very tender and although we both agreed the fries which came with the sandwich were little salty side, but still tasty.  Was it cheap?  No, but whew, we didn't think we've wasted our money...\n\nI don't think we can afford their dinner anytime soon after spending too much money in Vegas this time but we were very pleased with their brunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

Pork Tenderloin - This is their specialty dish and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The meat was tender, juicy, very flavorful. The tamale that came with it was just OK, rather dry unfortunately. \n\n3. Tuna Steak - MUST SKIP! First time it came it was overcooked (dry, and cooked all the way, although I asked for seared w/ rare middle). The waiter was very polite and apologetic. He brought it back to the kitchen (I didn't ask for it, but he insisted). The second time it came, it was perfectly cooked, but WAY TOO SALTY. Seriously, I love bold flavors, but this made me think I was being punished for sending the food back. Again, I didn't even ask the waiter to send it back, so why was I being punished?\n\nService: \nWas excellent, almost flawless.\n\nConclusion:\nThe pork & steak dishes deserve 5 stars, but the severity of the flaw on the tuna steak, considering the price range is rather unforgivable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

Despite most negative opinions of celebrity chefs, I think many of them can cook well. Personally, I enjoyed dining at Mesa Grill. \n\nMy friend and I came on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. We were both impressed by their staff's cordial and professional service. There was a complimentary bread basket which I was very impressed with and a wide selection of water, YES WATER, to chose from. So service receives 5 stars. Based on the number of parties I saw in the restaurant, reservations are probably not necessary for lunch or brunch. But it might be otherwise for dinner.\n\nWe started off with Chef Flay's famous Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale. I think this appetizer was definitely true to Flay's southwestern stile and is a must try. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet; corn tamale was fresh and fluffy and the his signature sauces were extremely flavorful. Each bite has a familiar spice kick.\n\nThen, we ordered the BBQ Lamb Cobb Salad and the Eggs + Aged Strip Loin Tortilla. The cobb salad and lamb were divine! I loved the buttermilk dressing, so good!  The tortilla dish was on the mediocre side and made me wish I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash (which has been on the menu for the last 8? years) However, I was mainly looking for a steak for lunch so it satisfied for cravings. Honestly, I could have gone without the egg and myriad of relishes (very beautifully plated) because the strip loin was cooked really well (medium rare, which I think is how all good meat should be cooked). It was incredibly tender and melts in your mouth. I will definitely have to come back for dinner to try his Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin.\n\nALSO, I LOVED the complimentary bread basket.

Even though there was Habanero (one of the most intense chili pepper in the world), it wasn't spicy at all. It was very flavorful. My husband loved it!

The decor is contemporary but not minimalist; it is upscale but approachable and warm (warm browns and reds throughout the dining area that give it an upscale Southwestern feel).  The high ceilings really open up the room; the seating is comfortable and nice.  Good design throughout the restaurant with an open kitchen and contemporary decoration that is subtle.\n\nThe assortment of complimentary bread was just okay though the most interesting look piece (a corn bread muffin with blue corn and jalapenos) was probably my least favorite of the batch.\n\nI started with the crispy quail, which came with a sauce of hot mustard, Ancho chile and Seitz Family Farm Honey.  The quail was breaded and fried, which was a risk because of the little bit of meat that comes with quail.  This one was good though.  The meat was moist and flavorful while the breading was crisp and not greasy (like good fried chicken).\n\nThe sauce was good and was bold in flavor--kind of a mix of a spicy southwestern sauce and a sweet BBQ sauce.  The sauce was not too overpowering and was a good compliment for the fried quail.  I wish they would have added some sides or garnishes to lighten the dish up though.\n\nI went with the veal chop and it was a generous portion.  The veal itself was great.  The outside sear was very good and the meat was juicy and moist, which can be hard to do because veal is so lean.  They used a good piece of meat here as well.\n\nThe sauce was a mix of horseradish and maple glaze.  Like the quail sauce, there was a bold mix of both spicy and sweet flavors here.  The sauce had a little too much heat though because it kind of overwhelmed my palate.  It was one of those spicy dishes where after several bites, you kind of just taste the burn and have a hard time getting the most out of the other flavors.\n\nThe veal chop came with a wild rice tamale.  I am not that familiar with tamales so I cannot speak to how well this one would stack up with others.  The wild rice flavor and texture really came across here (pretty good portion of wild rice).  The tamale itself had a strong corn flavor and was sweet and moist enough (not dry).\n\nThe waiter was very professional and knowledgeable about the menu.  Service was good--food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.\n\nPricing was high, but pricing is high at most Las Vegas restaurants.  The food at Mesa Grill was in a similar price range as Eiffel Tower Restaurant (Paris) and the food here was significantly better.  My veal chop here was actually less than what I paid at Spago in Beverly Hills--I thought Mesa Grill did a much better job cooking the meat to the appropriate temperature though I liked the accompanying sauce and sides more at Spago.\n\nI liked Mesa Grill and would return.  My friend (who is a Bobby Flay fan) was a little disappointed with this one so some dishes may stand out more than others.  The flavors here were quite bold (with strong mixes of sweet, savory and spicy on several dishes) so if you find a lot of fine dining places to be bland or too mild, this might be the one for you.  I do not have that much experience with Las Vegas restaurants, but I would say Mesa Grill would be one of the better ones I've tried.\n\nValet parking is complimentary.  I have not seen or used a self-parking structure here, but I would imagine they have that as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

So with the help of one of them, we were able to get a very good package at a reasonable price, especially compared to the quote we received from the banquet's department at Caesar's Palace.\n\nThe waitstaff were great at taking our orders and during the meal service.  The back private banquet room was fairly large and accommodated our large party (can't recall the exact number, but we had well north of 60 people, all seated in 3 long rows of tables).\n\nThe Tiger Shrimp + Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale with Corn-Cilantro Sauce was simply delicious.  The tamale was top notch, and the Flay-concocted Corn-Cilantro Sauce will pair up nicely with other seafood and poultry dishes.  \n\n\nFor my entree, I selected Bobby Flay's signature dish \"New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce + Sweet Potato Tamale with Crushed Pecan Butter\".  It was cooked perfectly and the flavors was very unique and complimented each other.  The sweet potato tamale was the best I have ever had.\n\nI tried a sample of my friend's \"Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon, Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce\".  Filet Mignon was good, but aside from being tender (which is why most people order it) it lacked the flavor I crave from beef, but the accompaning Mushroom-Ancho Chile Sauce was super!\n\nThe Blue Corn Crusted Alaskan Halibut + Salsa Cruda, Sweet 100 Tomatoes, Capers, Nicoise Olives, Fresh Basil + Oregano was also a nice fish entree.  And highly recommended.\n\nI know this review is based on a banquet experience instead of the more typical restaurant dining experience, but the food overall was good to great.  Service was superb, and the price we were able to negotiate for the event was unbeatable (big thanks to Mitch and the restaurant GM!!!)\n\nDecor: 4/5\nService: 4.5/5\nFood: 4/5\n\nLooking forward to going back for more.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

I was not thrilled I had to leave a credit card with my reservation, but got over it.  \nLovely decor, but nothing spectacular.\nHaving been in Vegas and eaten here at some other celebrity chef restaurants, I was expecting the high prices.  The food did live up to my expectations here.  Big, bold flavors (I had the pork, others at my table had the veal chop and the venison, and the same for those), perfectly cooked pork, delicious tamales, although a little sweet, went well with the very spicy pork and delicious sauce.  Portions were great here, almost too much.  Unlike the apps - small portions big prices.  Duck \"taco\" - 1 small blue corn soft tortilla with about 3 tablespoons of duck -$16.00.  Hard to share with 3 other people - about a tiny bite each! Hard for me to understand the price,although it was tasty.  The corn tamale with shrimp was delicious, a little better portion, but was described as having 4 jumbo shrimp - they were hardly jumbo, although we each did get one, and the flavors were good. Again, overpriced at $14 or $16 I can't remember.\nBiggest disappointment was service.  Friendly and knowledgeable, yes.\nWe ordered a pretty pricey bottle of wine, and when we ordered apps and told the waiter we would like to hold off on entrees for a few minutes, he basically informed us that we had to order everything at once, they were busy, yada yada yada.  There are few things that aggravate me more at a high end restaurant than when they dictate when I have to order what.  What is this, Dennys?  They can't manage a simple delay of ordering entrees?  Mostly, i just felt they were rushing us so they could fill up our table again.  Big no,no for me.  \nIf you are a Bobby Flay fan, and want ot see how close you come to making his food at home, eating here is a must. (It's not that hard to duplicate his recipes, they are fairly easy, and from this experience I see I can do it spot on).  The real true test for me of any restaurant is would I go back?\nNope!  There is a lot of great places in Vegas I would go back to, and have, BUT this is not one of them.  Easily duplicated, and very pricey, combined with Dennys mentality on the service make it a ONE TIME ONLY EXPERIENCE.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

We waited a super long time for our entrees, but after our meal he was quick to pick up the payment. Hmph! I tipped generously regardless. It was pretty busy in the restaurant and I think they could have been understaffed, there is a possibility that our poor service wasn't entirely the waiter's fault.

Small portions but just enough and delicious to pique our appetite. The sauces are a tad too sweet. The tamale was very good, with fluffy texture and not seasoned to overwhelm the maiz. The squid was cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too chewy.\n\nI had the veal chop which was recommended medium. I usually take my steak medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly at medium. It was juicy, and I loved the sauce - a little sweet like the other dishes, but the subtle horseradish really gave it a kick. The wild rice tamale was tasty, too, not too sweet.\n\nOthers in my party had the rib eye and the filet, both of which I sampled and found the sauce too sweet that it was hard to taste the meat.

Brussel sprouts - way too sweet like candy and I didn't care for them.

It is like panic-mode or something because one person is like \"seat everyone\" and then another person comes and is like \"don't seat anyone until 5pm!\" and there is just madness going on behind the counter where you place your reservations.\n\nFinally, someone looked up at me and asked if they could help me.  I asked for a table of one.  They said they could seat me at 5:15pm.  WHAT?!  It's 5pm and there are PLENTY of tables that no one is at.  I am ONE PERSON!  I was a little confused.  So I just stood & waited.  Truthfully, I was a little pissed.  But, within 5 minutes I was sat at a table.\n\nI sat for about 5 minutes when finally a waitress, that had been just standing over to the side, talking to another waiter, decided to come over and ask what I wanted to drink.  I only wanted water.  So a couple minutes later, water comes to the table.  I asked her a couple of questions and ordered the Sophie Chopped Salad.  \n\nThe Sophie Chopped Salad- kidney beans, garbanzo peas, lettuce, olives, chunks of cheese, little blue & white tortilla pieces and a yummy dressing.  I would totally order this again!!\n\nAfter I placed the order, about 3 minutes later some bread was brought to the table.  There were 3 pieces of bread- a blue corn muffin, a habanero bread and a cranberry (tasted a little sweeter) bread. Then immediately, my salad came to the table.  \n\nThe salad was DELICIOUS!  OMG!  I really want to go back and get it again!  I loved every inch of it!  The bread was divine too!  My bill came to just under $13.

We chose appetizers based on previous reviews and these were delicious as were most of our desserts. Our entrees however when finally delivered were a huge disappointment - my chili relleno was awful - it practically oozed with so much cheese I couldn't find the chili in there and the chicken was basically no better than business class airplane food.

I enjoyed the Blue Corn Muffin. That had to be one of the better breads in the basket. It had a nice flavor and there were actual bits of corn in there which was nice. I also enjoyed the Asiago Bread, but would have liked a stronger cheese flavor to it.\n\nFood wise, I very much enjoyed the Smoked Chicken and Black Bean Quesadilla. It was crispy and flavor wise, everything worked very well. I'm not too crazy about beans, but I ate this dish happily. For the main dish, the best dish was my friend's chicken. I rarely order chicken dishes when I dine out because it's easy to cook at home and I'd rather try something more adventurous. However, after trying our dishes (the fiance and I ordered the pork and sea bass), we regretted not ordering the chicken.\n\nI was very disappointed with the Pork Tenderloin and Chilean Sea Bass. Mesa Grill is known for its pork dish, and even though the texture was soft, the flavors just didn't seem right. It also had a very odd after taste, which was disappointing. The Sea Bass was also nothing special. It was cooked very well, but I wasn't crazy about the flavors and it had a very fishy after taste. \n\nMy fiance and I both agreed that we probably wouldn't come back here.

The corn was the perfect accompaniment too. As for the margarita, you can custom-create your own from their list of tequilas or choose a concocted mix. I had the white peach margarita which was fantastic.\n\nWe had the chicken with sweet potato hash and the steak and egg. The first is very unique and very Bobby. It's a little spicy, and it is basically two huge mounds of chicken and hash mixed together. Very creative. The steak and egg was more traditional; you pretty much just make your own fajitas from guacamole, sour cream, egg, peppers, etc. Also good (although not spectacular) because of the fresh ingredients. \n\nService was slow, although our server apologized because it was really busy.

I love Bobby Flay and have always wanted to eat at his restaurants. So when I learned I would be vacationing in Vegas, I knew this place was a must but after reading the reviews on Yelp, I was skeptical.\n\nAnd I had every right to be. \n\nWe went in early in the afternoon, around 1:30pm. First of all, when we got to the Forum Shops/Caesars Palace we weren't sure where to go. We checked the directory and Mesa wasn't on it! So we asked a girl at a gellato stand. She directed us to go all the way down to the bottom of the Forum Shops. When we made our way there, we still couldn't find it and had a man tell us we had to go all the way back! Frusterated, we went outside and walked to the front of Caesers, went inside and finally found it. But when we finished and took a left, we walked right into the Forum Shops where we first started out, right by the gellato stand where we got directions the first time! I don't know if she wasn't educated on the layout or simply was tired of having people ask for directions and sent us on a wild goose chase. Either way, it was very frustering.\n\nAs for the actual restaurant, we were seated right away. Like previous reviews, the seating/tables are very close to each other, I'm sure so they can pack in as many diners as possible. \n\nService was okay, nothing to write home about. \n\nNow, the food......oh, the food. I ordered the famous Pork Tenderloin sandwich, as I LOVE spicy food and the server told us it was probably the spiciest dish on the menu. Um, really? It had almost NO spice, and really no flavor whatsoever. The fries were overdone and just not very good. My boyfriend ordered the burger, which was WAY better than what I ordered and I ended up finishing it for him. He also was not impressed with the fries.\n\nBefore I forget, the bread basket was very disappointing. I was looking forward to the jalapeno bread and it was soggy and not spicy even though I could see the bits of jalapeno in it. The rest of the bread was also meh. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I had the experiance but I won't be back to Mesa Grill. Sorry, Bobby.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

Everything about this place is vividly bold and colorful. The contemporary decor, the presentation of each dish, and even the drinks. \n\nBobby's famous blue corn pancake w/ bbq'd duck is a must have. The habanero chili and star anise sauce add a savory sweet kick to each bite. The duck was well cooked and tender, and although a mess to eat, no scraps were left behind. Chorizo quesadilla w/ fried egg was also a delicious starter. Oozing yolk blended with habanero sauce and grated parmesan over a crisp crust never tasted so heavenly.\n\nWith my heart set on the spicy chicken & sweet potato hash w/ poached eggs, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew it would be good. Two whopping mounds of poached eggs ridiculously drenched in green hollandaise and habanero sauce (notice the pattern?) set before my eyes as I wiped a little bit of drool off my face. I can't recall any other time I've experience such explosive flavors all at once. This dish is a bit on the heavy side, so don't hesitate loosening up a notch on the ol' belt loop. The jumbo lump crab cake isn't on the regular menu, but we were lucky enough to catch a taste of it off the lunch prix fixe. Complemented by a blanket of corn relish and pablano vinaigrette, it would be a shame not to permanently include this on the menu. Typically, crab cakes are made small in size, but this one was considerably well portioned. Definitely one of my more meatier crab cakes I've ever seen. Ended the meal with a dark chocolate creme brulee and pineapple upside down cake w/ caramelized rum, which were both a delightful treat.\n\nPrices are reasonable, but tend to add up quickly.

We had planned to go last year for our anniversary but had to cancel as my wife was found out she had to have surgery and wasn't supposed to eat red meat in the meantime. Now that she's all better, we decided to give it a try this year.\n\nI ordered a Mesa margarita, and my wife ordered a prickly pear margarita. Both were very good. I liked the taste of mine a little better, but the prickly pear was prettier. It had a pretty magenta color.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our appetizer, we were given a bread basket with three types of bread: corn bread muffin, jalapeno bread, and a nut bread. They were all very good. The corn bread was half regular corn and half blue corn which gave it an appealing appearance. My favorite was the jalapeno bread. It had a nice consistent flavoring of jalapeno without being overwhelming.\n\nFor appetizer we split the tiger shrimp tamale. The shrimp was perfectly cooked. It was like a deconstructed tamale. The shrimp was laid on top of the cornmeal. The sauce was very flavorful, and the dish was well-balanced.\n\nFor our entrees we had the pork tenderloin and the veal chop. The pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and tender. The sauce wasn't quite as flavorful as I had hoped for, but it was still delicious.\n\nThe veal chop was also perfectly cooked and tender. The seasoning was spot on.\n\nBoth entrees were served with a cornmeal tamale thingy that was presented like a baked potato. It was very good and was an interesting presentation. \n\nFor our side, we split the Brussels sprouts with pomegranate seeds and pecans. It was an interesting mix of flavors and colors. I never would have thought of combining Brussels sprouts and pomegranate seeds, but it definitely worked.\n\nWe took half of our meals to go and were too stuffed to order dessert, though there were definitely some appealing selections on the dessert menu. Maybe next time.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our entree my wife asked if there was a celebrity behind her. I thought that was an odd question and asked her why she asked. We were sitting near the kitchen and she said all of the kitchen workers were looking at someone behind her. I glanced over and saw Tyra Banks sitting a few tables over. Apparently she was at Caesar's for Celine Dion's rehearsal show as we later saw her in line to get into the show.\n\nThe service was a little slow, and even though we got there before the evening rush, we had a lengthy wait between our appetizer and our main course. Because of this, I'd give Mesa 4.5 stars. As we can't pick half stars, I'm gonna round-up and pick 5 stars.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

In fact, when it was all said and done, I ended up going with one of his suggestions - the Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles along with the Rough Cut Tuna Nachos that a few of my friends wanted to split.\n\n- The Rough Cut Tuna Nachos - served with a mango & habanero hot sauce and avocado crema...terrific.  The tuna is similar to Hawaiian poke, but with Southwestern flavors instead.  In a way, with the crema, it's reminiscent of a guacamole salsa, but better.  Much better.  Too bad there aren't any places around here that serve it the same way.\n\n- Scrambled Eggs Chilaquiles - served with a roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche.  Presentation wise, all of the colors on the plate really made it stand out (blue corn tortilla, orange sauce, white cheddar, green seasoning), but the execution is what really made the dish.  With three layers of crispy tortilla, it had a nice crunch, which worked well with the richness.  The combination of flavors were fantastic.  If anything, I wish there was more of a kick with the sauce, but it tasted great as is.\n\nIn addition, I also got a chance to try my friend's Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash, but I thought my entree was better.  Although I did like the spiciness and flavor, I would have like a little contrast in the texture.  Along with our meal, they also served a basket of bread, all with some Southwestern twists.  They were all decent, but my favorite of the bunch was the jalapeno bread.  \n\nIn the end, I'll give Flay his due...the guy can offer up a pretty good brunch menu.  The ones that I tried were great, though I know a few of my friends were not as enthralled with their orders (hence the four stars).  None of them said the dishes were bad though, so maybe it was just a case of hopeful expectations not being met.  Reviews on here are pretty high for dinner as well, so I'd be interested in checking that out next time.  At least now, I have another reason to go back to Vegas...not that I really needed another one anyways.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw"}

I had the tiger shrimp, roasted garlic, corn tamale with cilantro sauce for my appetizer. I have always lived in places that have given me the best access to fresh seafood, but this was seriously the best shrimp I have ever had in my life! Then I had the pan seared wild striped bass with roasted yellow pepper grits and yellow pepper romesco. All the flavors were so complex. There were so many sauces - spicy, sweet, salty, creamy - it really made the food exciting! We topped it all off with vanilla bean panna cotta with macerated berries. They let the berries soak in grand marnier for two days.

Anyhow the bread and butter is always yummy and I do recommend the quiche which was delicious.  The pate was okay but I didn't know that the country pate was more on the chunkier side, so if you like a more mousse like pate then maybe try the chicken liver one.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

There were many empty tables and sections available yet we were sandwiched between other tables like sardines. \n\nAlthough the servers were nice they never asked us if our meal was ok and they couldn't infer by the barely eaten plates that something was awry. The NY Strip was served 2 temperatures overcooked. My girlfriend's salad was taken away before she was finished because there was no room on the table for an extra plate and they brought our Main Course out to us before we finished our salads. Absolutely awful experience. You should have seen the sight of everyone who ordered the steaks sawing away at the rubbery excuse for steak.

The buffet line at the Bellagio was too long, so we looked for the closest alternative without a long wait.\n\nLunch was amazing starting with warm baked bread and butter, and awesome smoked salmon and brioche and capers. We had the steak frites, ordered medium rare, but it came out closer to medium well. The waiter gave us two sauces. The blue cheese sauce was nicely buttery, but be sure to break up large chunks of cheese for a more blended flavor. The second sauce were caramelized onions in a nice, but powerful red wine sauce. Tip: Pour blue cheese sauce over steak and fish out onions to top your cut gives you the flavor of the soaked in wine sauce, but it doesn't overpower the dish. The frites reminded me of chip like fries, thin and crunchy like chips, shaped like fries. The thyme seared salmon was beautifully cooked, moist and topped over a bed of orzo spinach and peas.\n\nThe cocktails are delicious, yet strong. The Nutty Russian was my first drink of the day, but by the end of it, I was close to drunk. But then again at $12.95 for one, I better be drunk after.\n\nOverall, with a view of the Bellagio water works and plenty of people watching, it was a pleasant meal and I'm definitely coming back to try the mussels in herbs and white wine sauce.

She read about Mon Ami Gabi and wanted to try their breakfast so we made our reservation via Open Table for December 27th at 10 AM.  When I made the reservation, there was a box I could write a note to the Maitra D'.  I wrote we're celebrating my sister's belated birthday and she wanted to have the breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi.  Hoping we could order a dessert and I could ask them for a candle or something for her but when we get there, we're never asked about it at all. \n\nWe were there a few minutes early.  I don't know how long she's been working for that day but the hostess at the door wasn't very welcoming and didn't even crack a smile.  The popular patio was wide open and it was a very nice morning so we decided to have a table out there.  She took us to the very end of patio where nobody was around, even though only less than 20% of tables were occupied at the patio.  It was still chilly and the heating pole wasn't lit yet.  When we asked her about it, she said it should be turned on soon and she left.  I was worried if our first experience at Mon Ami Gabi would be like her, stuck up with a horrible attitude.  However our waitress came immediately after the hostess left and told us this spot would be too cold for us and the heating pole was not working so she moved us to the right in the center where we're surrounded by three working heating poles.  If I were a manager or the owner of the restaurant, I would hire someone at least smiles for the \"greeting\" hostess.  I say the first impression is very important.\n\nUnlike the unfriendly hostess at the door, our waitress was fantastic.  She was very friendly and attentive, she made the rest of our M.A.G. experience so much better.\n\nThe coffee was pretty good, not too weak but not too strong or bitter.  Their fresh squeezed orange juice was also good.  I've ordered their crab eggs benedict with breakfast potatoes and my sister ordered chicken and cheese crape.  When I saw my eggs benedict's potion, I was not sure if it would fill my big tummy but it did.  I didn't see the big chunk of crab meat but it sure did taste like crab and the buttery home fries (breakfast potatoes) were tasty too.  My sister's crape had some brie cheese in it and had a very elegant taste.  \n\nWe're too full to order any desserts but I still wished if they asked me if I wanted to do something for my sister. \n\nBy the end of our breakfast, the patio tables were completely full.  It was too early for Bellagio's fountain show but still it was fun to watch people who past by.  At least we had three or four people who shouted \"Viva Las Vegas!\" or something like that during our 1.5 hrs or so dining time and I thought there were more variety of fun and wacky people out there than my hometown Los Angeles.     \n\nThe food was good if not exceptionally great.  With the patio seating and the great service we've got from our waitress, we'll be back for breakfast or lunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

The corned beef had good flavor, but the meat was a little stringy. The waffle was decent, but the saddest part was the \"hot maple syrup.\" Now I am a New-England girl, and picky about my maple syrup, but I think anyone paying $12 for a waffle should rightfully expect real maple syrup.  This was not. It was the typical maybe-maple-flavored corn syrup you'd find at any cheap diner. Yuck! Totally unacceptable. \n\nWe finished quickly and left.

It was a bit far from the center of the strip ~10 minutes walking. The decorum of the restaurant was very cute and resembles a modern cafe in France. Casual and delicious! \n\nService was OK in that there seemed to be no designated waiter per table so you had to flag one down to ask for the check. However, they did refill our glasses multiple times, so I can't complain. Bottled or sparkling water are complimentary. \n\nI recommend coming for brunch, which is only offered on weekends. Their lunch menu is very limiting but it is still possible to pick out some interesting and tasty dishes. If you have never had escargot, I would recommend trying it at Mon Ami Gabi because it is not as slimy (which may seem revolting).\n\nI came here on weekday afternoon. We started with the Escargots de Bourgogne which is oven roasted snails cooked in garlic herb butter. I believe this is true, butter makes EVERYTHING tastes good. ;) I like escargot and this dish made me like it more. If I had a larger group and a bigger appetite, I would have tried more dishes from their Hors D'Oeuvres because it truly gives you a taste of authentic french cuisine. I would recommend Country Style P\u00e2t\u00e9, Chicken Liver Mousse, Sea Scallops Gratin\u00e9es  and Oysters Du Jour if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nFor lunch, their offerings are predominantly, sandwiches, crepes, salads and steak frites (which is essentially steak with thinly cut fries).\nFor brunch, I have heard good things about their french toast, pancakes, crepes and eggs benedicts. \n\nThe two of us ordered the Croque Madame and Seafood Crepe for entrees. Croque Madame was fine but the seafood crepe was show-stopper. First of all, the crepe was buttery and thin, strewn over with a b\u00e9chamel cream sauce. The shrimps and scallops were fresh, tender and sweet. And the combination of textures and flavors satiated my palate. Definitely recommended!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi and will come back next time for their brunch. Our check came out for ~$17 pp, which was reasonable compared to how much we ate.

The inside has a nice ambiance as well, but get a table outside if you can.  \n\nOur waiter was incredibly attentive throughout the meal, refilling water, asking if we wanted more bread (the bread was delicious, btw), etc.  She even anticipated that we wanted separate checks and was more than happy to arrange it, which sadly most restaurants get very bitchy about.\n\nWe all got a steak entree with frites.  Don't order any side dishes - they give you a MOUNTAIN of frites!  I could barely finish half of them.  My steak was quite large as well.  I had the steak bordelaise, which had a yummy caramelized onion and wine sauce with it.  My friends had the filet mignon and the steak bearnaise, which were both very good.  Perhaps it wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but still excellent.  And with the addition of the ambiance and the service, I have to give this place 5 stars.\n\nTo clarify, this is a $$ restaurant if you order a non-steak entree (they have burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish etc.) or a steak frite entree (the thin cuts of steak) without drinks, appetizers or dessert.  If you order one of the more select steak cuts or start adding sides to your meal, this is more of a $$$ restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

If you've read about my past experiences here, then you'll probably already know what to expect from this review.\n\nIt was very chilly outside when I had breakfast here for my last meal in Vegas before flying home and it was also still early so the heat lamps out on the patio weren't fired up yet, so they had seated at a very cozy table by the window, which was still a great spot for some early morning people watching.\n\nSince I didn't want to take the risk in picking something new that could potentially result in a disappointing last meal in Vegas, I took the safe option and went with their Eggs Benedict (14.95) since I had their Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (15.95) last time and loved it.  And once again I had their fresh OJ and bottomless Coffee.  As expected, the Eggs Benedict was perfect (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=JwV3dbADg-18GS6NESEBSQ).  Every bite was scrumptious!  And once again, the Hash Browns were packed with flavor with the caramelized onions inside.  Loved it!!\n\nAnd there isn't much more I can say about their morning service other than it was spot on like last time.  Though it was a little more busier, I didn't have 20 or so waiters refilling my half empty cup of coffee every 5 mins.  Oh well, can't complain too much about that since I still had a very good waitress.\n\nI'm really starting to enjoy Mon Ami Gabi a lot more as a breakfast option as the place is more mellow and very relaxing compared to the more active atmosphere for lunch and dinner, but you do miss out on the Fountains of Bellagio as they start up later in the day.  If you haven't stopped by here yet for a bite, give it a try and dine out on the patio when the weather is nice.  It definitely makes for a great first or last meal in Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

I came here with a group of friends for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. We had made reservations ahead of time through their website and noted that we were celebrating his birthday and requested a table near the windows so that we would have a view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately and got a wonderful table inside by the window and the view was amazing! On a side note, if the weather permits it, it is definitely worth it to wait for a table on the outside patio. The restaurant does NOT reserve these outdoor tables, so it is on a first-come-first-serve basis. But you can still request a table inside with a view.\n\nFresh french bread was brought with some creamed butter and a little bit of something that resembled a reddish pink coleslaw, but it was so tasty with the bread! I ordered a caraffe of the Frangria (so delicious) and a bottle of Perrier water for the table, and my boyfriend ordered a separate glass of wine. For appetizers, my boyfriend and I shared a shrimp cocktail. Our friends ordered a Caesar salad and a French onion soup that had the cheesiest layer of cheese baked right on top!\n\nI ordered the steak classique rare. My boyfriend ordered the sea scallops, and our other friend ordered the beef bourguignon. One thing I noticed when they served the beef bourguignon was that the server kept the noodles and beef stew separate and spooned the stew on top of the noodles at our table. It looked and tasted so rich and beefy and stewy! Everything looked fantastic! I have to admit that my steak was a little hard to cut and was chewy, but it was because I had ordered it rarer than usual. The finely cut pommes frites were also a perfect addition to my steak. At the end of it all, we decided to get dessert at another place just to explore more sweet options, but the waitress brought us a complimentary profiterole, a pastry that was filled with ice cream  and topped with a candle for my boyfriend! Next time I am definitely staying after dinner for an artisan cheese platter or a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\n\nMon Ami Gabi's prices were another big reason I chose to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday there. The prices are very fair for the quality of food, service, and experience you get and also low enough to not break the bank or feel guilty that one of your friends could only afford a glass of water. I will definitely be returning to Mon Ami Gabi to celebrate my birthday!\n\nAlthough the service was awesome, the view was phenomenal, and the food tasted great, we still had one gripe: being a very classic French bistro, there simply was not enough food on the plates for both my very American boyfriend and his friend. They ended up leaving and buying a hamburger right after dinner haha! So I recommend Mon Ami Gabi if you and your date aren't too hungry, or with a group of girls. But if you're not into French restaurants with relatively smaller portions, head for the Bellagio Buffet across the street. : )", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

But I felt strongly enough about my last visit to waste some time venting here. \n\n7:30am on a brisk Saturday morning, I found myself crossing town on the way home from a night of a carousing. As I've been known to do on such nights, I decided it would be a fine time to indulge in a nice breakfast. Being that the weather was particularly tolerable for February, I decided to bask in it & dine on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi. I've enjoyed my similar visits in the past. Sure, the food isn't as good as Bouchon, but while it's not cheap, it's not quite as expensive, and the smoking-friendly patio has been enough to make up for any culinary shortcomings. So what happens when you disturb that equation? As it turns out, those pluses aren't strong enough to carry the place.\n\nThere were two things in particular that chapped my ass. Firstly, there was the construction team out working or surveying or whatever on the patio. I got there pretty close to opening, and hey, the works gotta get done sometime. But the incessant pacing back & forth, discussion, and ladder-arranging turned out to be disturbing enough to aggravate my otherwise saintly patience. Being that I'm such a nice guy, by the time I'd had enough the place started filling up, so the construction team was forced out by necessity, so I never had to speak up. I was distracted enough by everything that I didn't notice how filthy my water glass was. I'm not the kind of guy to bitch about things like that, but it was bad enough that I didn't feel out of place for asking for another glass. I explained what happened to the waiter, and he quickly replaced my glass. I continued on with my meal, and as I was done I picked up my water to find that the new one was just as bad as the first. Now, you would think that when someone - right or wrong - brings up a complaint like that the staff would spend the extra 30 seconds it would take to find the shiniest glass in the rack. Not at Mon Ami Gabi! By this point I was done eating, so I decided to just mention it to the waitress when she asked how everything was. Well, that opportunity never presented itself (which is a problem unto itself in my opinion). \n\nAm I nitpicking? Maybe. But Mon Ami Gabi is by no means cheap, and their food is not so spectacular that it makes up for everything else. And sure, breakfast is considered a \"lesser\" meal at places like this, but that doesn't mean they get a pass on anything that happens before noon. A year ago this would've given them a 4 star review. Maybe I'll try again and see if I caught them on an off day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

First of all, I ordered it medium and it came as medium rare.  The sauce was supposed to be merlot butter but it was so bland that I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to flavor it.  But after about 3 bites, I had to trade it with my fiance for his Roast Chicken which was even worse!  \n\nAnd those FRITES, what the hell were those?  String potato chips?  You could have served it with FRENCH fries and that would have been better.  \n\nService was friendly but I wouldn't say it was attentive.

We were way too hungry and lazy and to be honest, just wanted to sit our asses down and be served. So we walked around looking for other places to dine that weren't so packed when we discovered this cute little restaurant hiding in the corner. \n\nWe got an amazing table outside on the patio on the most gorgeous Vegas day. It was already a fantastic start to a delicious meal. The service was great too. Our waitress was very cute and so friendly, she made us feel right at home. \n\nWe started with their Fruit Bouquet, which I had seen on several other tables. It was a beautifully carved cantaloupe filled with melon, grapes and pineapple that came with sides of creme fraiche, mint syrup and brown sugar. YUM. A perfect way to start breakfast. The fruit was so fresh and the little accompaniments paired perfectly. I personally loved the pineapple with the mint syrup and the cantaloupe with the creme fraiche. \n\nFor our entrees my bf chose the Egg, Bacon & Cheese crepe with some added avocado on top. I chose the special Benedict of the day which came with spinach, tomato and bacon on a toasted sourdough muffin with a chive hollandaise. We also had to get a side order of the frites, they just looked so good!\n\nEverything was absolutely delicious. The crepe was perfectly cooked, really melted in your mouth. The cheese was chewy while the crepe was delicate, and the egg and bacon rounded all the flavors out very nicely. The avocado that my bf added also was a nice touch!\nMy benedict was very good, the eggs were cooked perfectly which is a huge plus. Almost every benedict I get at a restaurant has over-cooked poached eggs, but these were nice and runny. Mmm! They weren't kidding about the 'toasted' muffin though. Mine was definitely a little more well-done than I would have liked but it was still yummy. I loved the muffin because it had a really distinct sourdough taste that went well with the rest of the Benedict flavors. \n\nThe frites were also tasty. We could barely finish just one order because it was so big. Don't be fooled, it looks all cute and small in that little paper cone but it seems practically bottomless. Keep in mind though these are not typical fries, they are very thinly cut and fried until crispy then topped with a good amount of salt. If you like really crispy potatoes then you will love these. Otherwise, if you want regular french fries don't bother. \n\nDefinitely a great experience for both of us and we were both so lucky to come on such a beautiful day.

And again, the food was memorable as was the ambience.\n\nMore recently 2 of my friends and I had lunch here and we all loved it so much we've decided to make this our favorite lunch spot.\n\nOne ordered the LEMON THYME SALMON.  She said it was the best salmon she'd ever had and I had to agree.  It was just a bit rare in the center which is what it's supposed to be and the lemon thyme flavor shone through.  \n\nThe other One ordered a steak, done medium rare and she said it was perfect.  I didn't taste the steak but she loved it.\n\nI ordered one of my favorite dishes TROUT GRENOBLAISE.  Wow.  It was absolutely fabulous.  The sides we ordered were shared and there wasn't a thing we could find to complain about here.\n\nService was a little on the slow side but it was crowded and we were in no hurry.    If you want patio seating next to the railing you need to get there just before they open so you can be seated among the first.  It's worth it just to sit and watch the fountains and the throngs of people walking by.   Take your time here.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

We had eaten here, years ago, for lunch and dinner - and both were good experiences.\n\nEven though it was a little chilly, we opted to have our Saturday breakfast outside on the patio (they have heaters). The menu looked great. I appreciated that they offered some non-breakfast items (french onion soup, spinach salad, etc.) in addition to the more typical breakfast items. The breakfast items ranged from omelettes to chocolate and bacon waffles to sweet and savory crepes.\n\nWe decided to play it somewhat safe and go with an omelette. I liked that their omelettes had what felt like a French-twist (brie, etc.). When our omelette arrived, everything looked delectable. The omelette came with hash browns, green beans (yeah, green beans), and toasted bread. We also ordered a side of bacon. \n\nThe omelette was very light and fluffy - cooked perfectly. While it had a lot of spinach, I tasted little cheese. And despite being advertised as \"spinach and green vegetables\", it was just spinach. 2 stars. The green beans (seriously, green beans) were outstanding. I don't know what they were cooked in (there seemed to be a hint of garlic?), but they were awesome. 5 stars. The hash browns were also great. Good balance of crispy and soft - and there were a lot of flavors going on. Definitely no need for hot sauce or ketchup or anything. 4 stars. The bacon looked amazing, but was a bit of a let down. The glaze was incredible, but the bacon itself wasn't crisp enough (despite the menu calling it \"crispy bacon\") and was too fatty. 2 stars.\n\nThe drinks were nothing special. The mimosa was just your standard mimosa. The bloody mary bar (they bring you the glass and vodka, you visit the ingredient station and create your own drink) was pretty eh. They had standard bloody mary mixes in ice, ok selection of hot sauces, no worcestershire sauce, not enough tongs for everything, etc. 2 stars.\n\nI so want to give this place 4 stars, but based on our particular meal, I just can't. However, the service and ambiance are definitely 4 stars. And I think we may just have ordered the wrong thing.

We went b/c some of my suitemates went there from their last visit. It topped the trip off perfectly as we spent the afternoon eating and chatting away at a window side table in this little bistro! I was thankful we got indoor seating since the weather had been really windy outside!\n\nFor Hors D'Oeurves we had:  Escargots de Bourgogne\nThis was a bit against my will but group majority prevailed. My previous encounter with snails were not pleasant but I decided to give them another shot. Honestly I couldn't really taste much of it as it was masked in the garlic herb sauce. It was just a chewy bit of something that I swallowed down. I liked to dip the baguette into the garlic herb sauce tho that was really yum-O. \n\nEntree: Trout Grenobloise\nI liked the flakiness of the fish.The pan-sear or however the skin was prepared was great. It was very crispy! It was mildly seasoned and hinted at the fish's natural flavor which was good. Overall i really liked it. It was light and the green beans that came with it were cooked nicely. \n\nSo there was the frites that came along in a cup and they were super yummy and quite addicting. Thinner than fries and maybe even than potato chips.\n\nat Last!1! time for Dessert!: Profiterole Trio A.K.A Cream puffs! \nThey were super good!!! It was napoleon style as we had vanilla, chocolate and strawberry filled centers. I loved the chocolate/ fudge sauce that was drizzled on them. The flavors were very concentrated and they put me to shame to the kind of cream puffs I had made in HS french class. Much better than Beard Papa too that has commercialized and supersized the cream puff. \n\nI def loved the atmosphere of this place and though it's on the pricier side, its a treat to come here with friends and check it out for one of the fancier meals one can have in Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "4bEjOyTaDG24SY5TxsaUNQ"}

We were seated after about 5 minutes of waiting, which still surprised me I guess since we had already reserved a table.\n\nThe decor and ambiance of the place is very appropriate; dimly lit and nice chairs/booths.\n\nThe menus surprised me a bit: they were made out of tissue paper and were used to wrap the napkins. Is that typical for a really nice restaurant? \n\nAfter ordering, we were given bread, which was plopped straight onto the table along with some butter and pistachios. I thought that was a bit awkward. We also had no bread plates. I guess Bouchon can't afford enough plates? \n\nAfter a bit, we were also served some marinated olives, which confused us a bit since we didn't order any olives. They turned out to be really salty and I only ended up spitting one out after trying it.\n\nThe wait for food wasn't too bad and our orders all came out at once. I had ordered the leg of lamb (about $33). The portions aren't especially big but it filled me up. The lamb was very good and flavorful and it definitely ended all too quickly. The thing that looked the most appetizing of all my friends was the chicken, which had a much bigger portion than the other dishes and smelled delicious.\n\nFor dessert, everyone had ordered one of everything on the menu (caramel custard, lemon tart, chocolate mousse, meringue, and chocolate bouchons) and we went around tasting all the desserts. Overall, all the desserts were really good.\n\nWe were having a pretty good experience until the bill came and it turns out that those olives they served us were not complimentary. Somehow they ended up serving us olives (which we did not order) and charged us for it. We told our waiter and he was very apologetic and immediately took it off our bill.\n\nOther than that mishap, I would say overall I had an OK experience at Bouchon. The waiters were nice, the decor was nice, and the food was nice. But with all the little details that were missed, Bouchon did not wow me, especially for a Thomas Keller restaurant and for the price we paid.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

I came on a Tuesday evening so luckily it wasn't too packed.\n\nWent with a group of four so we all got a different dish to try and taste as many things as possible. Food goes as follows.....\n\nFrench Onion Soup- One of the best preparations of french onion soup I've had, if not the best. The broth itself was extremely rich and flavorful and the cheese exterior was crunchy and went amazingly when mixed with the broth and onions. Beware because this dish is very rich and filling so it may be best to share it with someone else.\n\nPork Chop with brussel sprouts-This is the dish I ordered and I was very glad I did. Pork was super flavorful and paired with the rich sauce and brussel sprouts, the combination was great. Would have liked the pork to be a little more tender though.\n\nSteak and Frites- The steak was done medium rare and was super flavorful. Came alongside a huge portion of frites which were damn near perfect. Great Dish.\n\nLeg of Lamb-My friend got the lamb medium rare and it was pretty good. Wasn't the best preparation of lamb and wasn't as tender as I would have liked, but the flavor was good and he really enjoyed it.\n\nGlazed Pork Belly-This was an appetizer special of the day. The pork came with a tiny portion, but was packed with flavor. Would definitely recommend this if it is a special of the day.\n\nUnfortunately we were beyond full at the end of the meal, we weren't able to order any dessert. Overall I really liked Bouchon and can't wait to try Keller's other restaurants. The reasons that it wasn't a 5 star for me was that it was a little pricey and service was a little pretentious, but other than that I was very satisfied.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

After dinner we each got a different dessert and shared them all and they were all incredible and compliment each other well. The lemon tart was huge and easily the biggest dessert there. Very tangy so only get it if you like the sourness of lemon. The chocolate dessert was incredibly rich as was the meringue over cream.

I have never been a fan of french toast, but after impulsively ordering it at Bouchon, I am now french toast's biggest fan. Bouchon's french toast is a cinnamony, sweet, cylindrical stack of pure goodness. \nThe only reason I give Bouchon a 4 star rather than a 5 star is because my husband's $26 Breakfast Americain was really nothing special. It was a glorified Denny's breakfast (i.e...scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon). The only thing that saved it from being amongst the rank of diner food was the addition of a Bouchon pastry of your choice. O...M...G. We got the pain au chocolat, but really, they're ALL good.

Yummy.\n\nOur main dishes were signature the Croquet Madame and one of their specials (my french is awful, but it was scrambled eggs on a housemade puff pastry with spicy sausage).  Both dishes were delicious but H-E-A-V-Y.  Don't think I'll be craving either dish again any time soon...\n\nWaiter was very friendly, but service was a little slow.  Great ambiance.  A must try in Vegas, at least once...", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

I got the French Toast (brioche) and thought it was perfectly presented and tasted excellent. \n\nThe tables we were seated in was the kind where one person sits on a booth that runs the length of the restaurant and other sits opposite across a long skinny table in a chair.  I was seated almost uncomfortably close to the German woman next to me--she was closer than my husband across the table.  The weird spacial arrangement of the tables combined with the dish clatter and bustle of the brunch rush made the conversational aspect of breakfast a bit awkward.  It was hard to talk or have a conversation when you feel like you are talking as much to the strangers next to you as you are your spouse.  I think that the diners who sat at actual tables rather than the long skinny booth thing probably had a better dining experience.

We had dinner reservations at 8:45 and were expecting to be completely wowed.  Wrong we were.  I'd like to get one thing straight - the food is great!  Actually beat my expectations.  But the service is awful.  Where to begin.\n\nWe arrived and were sat promptly.  The FIRST person to come to our table wasn't a server.  Nope.  Wasn't a bus person.  Nope.  It was the sommelier and that was after a good 10 minutes of being seated.  We were all in great moods after seeing a show and went with it making wine our main focus.  He was nice enough and helped us choose something.  \n\nApproximately 5 minutes after we ordered our wine we were served water.  Still no server.\n\nAnother couple minutes and we have warm bread and butter delivered.  Still no server.\n\nNow, honestly, we should have seen our server 20 minutes into being sat.  We are now poured wine and are enjoying it along with the warm bread.  \n\nFinally, we stop someone and ask to find our server.  Being incredibly annoying (or potentially simply observant) I watch the gentleman approach a woman who inevitably mouths 'I Know' with a look of irritation and rolls her eyes.  She then proceeds to go to another one of her tables to help them.  \n\nWhen she approaches us it is nothing short of patronizing  and simply an empty smile.  The meal continued with that level of service.  We took note that it wasn't just our server that had this empty, unhappy look.  All of the servers didn't look so happy.  And, I'd like to point out that I believe the GM walked by our table a couple times and surely he should have observed the lack of progression in our meal.  \n\nAgain, the food was great.  The poor team in the back isn't represented well in the front of the house.  I ordered the steak frites - delicious, my husband had the chicken, and the other couple ordered the mussels and the scallops.  Everything was wonderful.  The cheese plate to top off the meal was beyond delicious.  \n\nJust disappointing service that will prevent me from going back there and I really wanted to try the brunch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

Located on the 10th floor of the Venetian hotel, Bouchon has a nice dining room.  High ceilings and a brasserie-like feel with the floor, decorations and specials on chalkboard.  Formal table settings with white tablecloth.  I think this Bouchon may also feature outdoor dining.\n\nBouchon's breakfast menu is reasonably priced (given its Las Vegas competition).  Most of their breakfast items run below $20.  You will probably pay anywhere from $12-$16 per dish at Las Vegas cafes and even though the portions would probably be bigger than what you will find at Bouchon, it is very likely that those same cafes would be using lower quality ingredients.\n\nI went with the Croque Madame.  The sandwich was a toasted ham and cheese sandwich on brioche that was topped with a sunny side up egg and Mornay sauce.  The sandwich was okay.  It was tasty and filling, but I felt the Croque Madame at Comme Ca was much better.  Comme Ca's sandwich has a great toasted Gruyere cheese crust that is kind of like the cheesy top of baked lasagna.\n\nBouchon's version lacked that cheese top and it made the sandwich feel a little boring (also, the sandwich was a little dry on the edges--kind of like dry toast that has not been buttered).  The Mornay sauce (which Comme Ca's sandwich lacks) was okay, but it did not really do anything to make the sandwich stand out.  The egg was nicely cooked.\n\nThe french fries were good.  While the fries were good (hot, crisp and flavorful), they do kind of remind me of when you get a really good batch of McDonald's french fries.  Not that that's a bad thing.  McDonald's french fries are quite popular.  The portion of french fries here was very generous.\n\nService was very good.  Good hostess who was very accommodating and observant; also, a very polite and attentive waiter.\n\nLas Vegas food is typically overpriced.  This Bouchon, on the other hand, is pretty similar (maybe slightly more expensive) than the Beverly Hills Bouchon.  You could easily eat much worse in Vegas in the same price range.  Because of that, Bouchon (for breakfast or dinner) is probably a good option for dining in Las Vegas even if I did not enjoy the food as much as I hoped.\n\nComplimentary parking is available.  I used valet though I think self-parking is also available.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

Breakfast was by far my favorite meal here.  I think my expectations for dinner were simply too high, and frankly there are way too many fine dining options in town to bother giving dinner here another try.\n\nInitially I balked at eating breakfast here, but truth be told, after spending $45 for two at the Grand Lux Caf\u00e9 (your basic small buffet experience, not unlike a business Marriott buffet), I figured how much pricier could it be at Bouchon?  Answer:  An additional $5. That's a bargain for the upscale environment, attentive service, and made-to-order food.\n\nTheir breakfast beignets are not to be missed, especially with their homemade peach jam.  Their fresh baguettes with butter and jam are also delicious.  You could easily be chowing down in a Parisian cafe.  I was especially happy with the yogurt parfait, which consisted of a layer of sauced berries, topped with vanilla yogurt, topped with granola, all served in an adorable mason jar.  Perfect way to start the day.  The Bud enjoyed the boudin blanc sausage, which was plump, juicy, and well balanced with spices.  The coffee refills were quick, and the coffee wonderfully strong.

Though one thing that was missing was my twisty French bread and jam.  It was okay though since the Croque Madame with Fries was more than enough for my morning meal.\n\nDespite the fact that even after three visits here I haven't had dinner yet, I still haven't regretted in choosing to go here for breakfast as it's still a step above all restaurants on the strip.

The two components tasted like two separate dishes on one plate.

I didn't know if I was eating breakfast or dinner.

A little greasy, but very flavorful & hearty. Topped with an egg (I chose soft scrambled.)\n-- tartine au thon ($17, tuna): open-face sandwich, tuna was very lemony.

Open for breakfast, brunch, and dinner I'd been to Chef Keller's Vegas Bistro on each of my previous three visits to Las Vegas and the opportunity to eat Christmas Brunch there with the three most important people in my life was simply too perfect and obvious a choice to pass up.  Having contacted the restaurant to be sure they'd be open on Christmas I was informed that they were indeed open but not taking reservations as is their Saturday Brunch policy - I was also told there would be \"holiday themed\" specials available.\n\nWaking early to be sure we'd arrive plenty early I have to admit I was a tad surprised when we were the first people in line at 7:45am, though we'd quickly be joined by twenty or so others before the doors opened with a pleasant Merry Christmas from the staff at exactly 8am.  Checking in at the hostess stand we were quickly whisked away to a great four-top near the windows overlooking the pools at the center of the Venezia tower and presented with menus.  With water poured the next person to visit our table would be our server, a pleasant young woman named Arlene who would live up to Bouchon's customary service - interested and forthcoming, knowledgable and efficient.  Describing the chalkboard specials (no \"holiday themed\" options to be found) and taking drink orders we were left to ponder our choices.\n\nWith two coffees, a tea, and orange juice served and refilled consistently (save for the orange juice) by the ever circling bussers we sat for mere moments before the ever-welcomed epi-baguette would arrive, this time with that same lovely butter and apricot preserves.\n\nStarting the meal proper and finally dining at Bouchon's brunch with a group I was this time able to order the pastry basket I'd previously held off on for fear that it would go to waste.  With four options to the basket plus one included with my aunt's Breakfast Americane the basket would actually be a silver platter with a blue cloth.  Featuring a cream cheese Danish, Pecan Sticky Bun, Orange Currant Scone, Chocolate Almond Croissant, and two Raspberry Beignets each taste was everything I've come to expect from Bouchon bakery and both the Cheese Danish and Orange Currant Scone were truly remarkable given the fact that I generally would not have ordered them at other restaurants.  Rumor has it that Keller is working on a Bouchon Bakery cookbook and this experience once again made me hope the rumors are true.\n\nFor my mother the choice would be a dish familiar to myself from two years prior; the bread pudding style French toast.  This time using D'anjou pears as opposed to the Bartletts from my visit but again with lovely layers of custard interspersed with cinnamon spiked compote of fruit between each layer there really isn't much that can be said about this dish that hasn't been praised before - a touch of maple syrup, a dust of confectioner's sugar to finish a truly decadent breakfast.  To temper the sweetness she also ordered a side of bacon - 7 thick strips of apple wood smoked Kurobuta pork for a mere $5.\n\nFor my sister, still feeling the effects of the gluttony at Picasso the night before, something light was desired and the decision was made to sample Keller's Waffle recipe.  Spiked with vanilla and so crispy on the exterior that I'd not be surprised if cornmeal was involved, the interior of the waffle was supple and spongy - textbook.  Topped with fresh bananas and chopped walnuts at a cost of $12 I can't say this was a cheap waffle, but all things considering it was light, tasty, and unfaultable.\n\nMy breakfast selection would be from the chalkboard.  Described merely as Oeuf du jour with Crab and Macaroni Gratin the dish itself would be served in a steaming hot low-ramekin.  Featuring tender macaroni intermingling with plump chunks of crab, gruyere, breadcrumbs, and butter at its base the dish was subsequently topped with two medium scrambled eggs and sauce Mornay with paprika and chives.  Creamy yet textural, slightly briny but sweet, and buttery beyond anything I've had in recent memory the dish was perhaps the best savory I've ever had for breakfast and the golden brioche served alongside harkened memories of Per Se and The French Laundry.\n\nWith plates cleaned our bussers would clear the table rapidly and Arlene would return with the check - no offer of dessert, just a \"No Rush - Merry Christmas and thanks for having brunch with us today\" as she handed us the check in a glass cup.  A tad annoyed at the lack of promised \"holiday themed\" specials we settled the tab and made our way to the door by 9:05 - a mere hour after we entered.  While certainly a good meal with great company this visit to Bouchon was a letdown largely due to heightened expectations.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

Also, the bread the sandwich came with was too hard...maybe even stale.  \n\nMaybe we should have ordered the chicken and waffles.  I dunno.

Neither one of us eat meat so we substituted fruit for the sausage.  We also ordered coffee and orange juice. \n\nThe drinks were just OK, nothing special. The OJ was fresh squeezed but it tasted like they old.

I wish I ordered more, but did not want to feel the guilt of wasting food that took so long and so much care to prepare. \n\nThe house salad was full of fresh mixed greens, topped with a round of herb goat cheese, and tossed with a red wine vinaigrette with shallots. It was amazingly light and very generously portioned. \n\nThe crab appetizer was a cold platter with a large claw and leg. It was served with lemon and 3 sauces, 2 of which we were sure were the same. They tasted almost exactly the same. One was a mustard and the other was your typical marinara sauce. \n\nThe dessert was the absolute best part of the meal. It was the special of the day.

We were served bread on the table, along with warm pasticcios. The bread is fresh - probably about a couple of hour's hold - crispy crust - soft and moist interior. The bread was served with little ramicans of butter - and you just grab a piece of a \"branch\" of the bread. \n\nHad a few items during my visit\n\nCoquilles St. Jacques Po\u00eal\u00e9s\nSomewhat of a light meal - but rich in flavor and texture. The Scallops were done perfectly, with not the texture of being coming rubber. Fork tender meat - with a nice serving of muschrooms. The sauce was rich in it's own right, a nice complement to the Scallops. \n\nSorbet aux Fruits\nIt tasted good! Fresh pear sorbet - tasted as a real pear on a summer's afternoon. \n\n\nPork delmonico chop, Brussels sprouts, red wine-glazed pears & roasted shallot pork jus\nThe pork chop was cooked exquisitely, perfectly done, nice amount feeling like a cave-man when eating this. The Brussels sprouts were a nice touch - but the red-wine glazed pears made the dish. A good natural sweetness (and tang?) to contribute to the savory-ness of the pork. The sauce it-self was sweet with the taste of pears - and some of the notes of the wine. Nice way to end a long day at work. \n\n\nCr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nFirst, it was delicious - a very sweet treat. The sugar was crispy; a floating crystal lake of sugar atop a soft-solid that is cr\u00e8me. The cr\u00e8me had a hint of vanilla, but the better part was it had black pepper in the dessert. A great spice kick and it was unexpected.  Bit of advice, it comes in a ramican that measures about 8\", once dish can easily serve two. \n\n\nService\nI gotta say service is top-notch, which is why I'm giving this place five stars. The staff here enjoys their work, has a sincere smile on their face - and always happy to assist you. Our waiter was patient with explaining the various items in detail that I would consider above the standard customer service.

It normally comes with the head attached, but I requested for the head to not be there. I wasn't a big fan of the toasted brioche, but overall the fish was tender, moist and just a tad bit too buttery for my liking. The fianc\u00e9 ordered the Gigot d'Agneau (lamb with lamb tongue). His lamb was a overcooked, which made it a lil tougher to eat. The tongue you couldn't even tell it was in the sauce, but it comes with beans and we are both not a huge fan of beans.

I believe the Beverly Hills location is just open for lunch and dinner so it made sense to give this Vegas spot a try for a nice brunch.\n\nBouchon is located on the tenth floor of the hotel.  They seem to have three dining areas--a classic indoor brasserie, outdoor dining and a private room for private parties and larger groups (which is where we dined on this visit).  I haven't been to their outdoor dining area, but the private room lacks the classic French brasserie feel of the main dining area.  The tables though are still nice (white table cloth) and the seating is comfortable.\n\nFor brunch, they started us off with a complimentary epi baguette that was served with butter and a smooth/thick cherry jam.  The epi baguette (a wheat stalk shaped bread where you rip off individual baguettes) was good.  The bread's crust was good and distinct while the center had a good chew to it.  The butter spread easily and the jam was flavorful.\n\nI went with their signature roasted chicken and bacon and chive waffles.  The roasted chicken was very good.  It was a half chicken.  The breast was tender and moist.  The skin had a great flavor and was nicely crispy.  The thigh and leg had much more flavorful meat as well as crispy skin (not too greasy or fatty either).\n\nThey served the chicken with a Sauce Chasseur.  The chicken was very flavorful and did not need it, but the sauce was a great accompaniment.  The sauce was similar to a brown gravy and was very flavorful.  The sauce had a good white wine taste to it and there were chunks of good veggies in it including mushrooms, carrots and onions.\n\nThe bacon and chive waffle was fluffy.  It was an interesting flavor combination.  First, you taste the vanilla (they used a good amount of it in the waffle).  Then you get the crispy and savory bacon taste.  Then you get the onion-like chive taste.  The waffle was garnished with a creamy Tahitian vanilla butter and maple syrup.  I am not sure if the flavor combination would be for everyone, but I liked the waffle.\n\nI also had some of the bacon a la carte and it was pretty good.  Flavorful and crisp though maybe not as good as some of the premium bacon out there (like the Niman Ranch bacon they serve at Huckleberry).\n\nService was good.  The waiter was friendly, polite and attentive.  The rest of the staff was attentive too.  Food came out an okay pace (maybe slightly slower than we would have liked).  Still, despite being a large party, all the food came out at about the same time.\n\nFor brunch, pricing was high here, but then pricing is high at a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Entrees run anywhere from about $15 to $25 here.  The good thing is that portions on most of the dishes are big enough that you do not have to supplement your order with any sides or pastries (they were providing a complimentary coffee cake-like dish in the waiting area and it was good).\n\nThis was my second visit to the Las Vegas Bouchon.  I've also been to the Beverly Hills one.  The roasted chicken and waffles was the best thing I've had here at either location and I would most likely come back here again for brunch if I was in Vegas for the weekend.  Service and food have been decent enough on both visits that I would also consider them for dinner.\n\nThere is a free parking structure at The Venetian.  The free parking structure has elevators that conveniently take you to the Bouchon restaurant without having to walk through the casino.", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

My boyfriend chose the chicken and waffles, and I went with the mussels and frites. We also couldn't resist the salmon tartare appetizer that was on special that day.\n\nFirst off was the salmon and a couple of mimosas. Both were extremely tasty. The salmon was super fresh, and served with bits of egg, red onion, capers, along with a bit of toasted bread. My only complaints was that we didn't get quite enough toast to eat everything and the small pieces of eggs and such were kind of difficult to get on the bread. The taste was fantastic, though.\n\nThen came the main courses, and they were as good as everyone says. The mussels were a nice variation on the usual preparation, as the mustard in the sauce gave it the kick that it needed. The fries were nicely crisp and perfectly seasoned, definitely in the top five of best fries I've ever had. And the chicken and waffles? I got to try a bit, and it was amazing. The waffle was nice and fluffy, with bits of bacon and chives in there. And they serve it with roasted chicken that was perfectly cooked.

I was pretty excited to try this place because of all the good reviews, but it was not the standard I was expecting.  I came here with a group of girls for dinner to celebrate a couple birthdays before going out to the Vegas clubs.  The decor was very cute and our waiter was very nice at first.  But when it came time to order, he seemed surprised that we did not want appetizers or drinks.  He went, \"Are you sure?  You don't want blah, blah, or blah?\"  I don't know if he meant to, but it made me and I think some of the other girls feel uncomfortable.  It felt as if he was implying that we were cheap or something.  I honestly didn't want to eat too much because I didn't want to feel bloated at the club.  And of course we didn't order drinks because we were going to drink later.  I ordered the steamed mussels with fries.  The warm bread that came out was really good and I especially liked it with the mustard.  Surprising, because I usually don't like mustard.  Our food took an unusually long time to come out, maybe almost an hour.  I really liked my mussels.  They were in this buttery white wine sauce.  But I thought the fries were unremarkable.  So I really only had mussels to eat with nothing else.... and after a while they were too much.  I felt like it needed pasta or rice or something.  Or maybe it was a dish meant to share.  When the meal was almost over, our waiter again acted surprised when we didn't order dessert.  But then he said, \"Little portions for little people!\" so it didn't feel so uncomfortable as the first time.  During the meal, we also felt that our water's didn't get filled enough, and we always had to flag someone down.  All in all, I was unimpressed.  I don't think I'd come back for dinner, however a lot of the reviews on here mention brunch.  So maybe I will give it another shot for brunch.

I cannot remember what everyone had, but here is what I can--- onion soup was unbearably salty, the poulet roti was dry and over-cooked, the steak bouchon was tough and wayyyyy too fatty (exactly----how does a fatty steak become tough) and the mussles were tiny.  That said, the trout was pretty good.  \n\nSo here is the main reason I think I need to leave only one star.  Way over-rated, and the waiter was absolutely awful.  He took our cocktails away when we were not done, tried to pull some very shady shit with our bill.

I think so.  I suppose, though, that each hotel has to have a multitude of ethnic restaurants in order to keep the guest from actually leaving the hotel/casino in which they are staying.  Anyway, we attended a private dinner party at Thomas Keller's Bouchon (in the Venetian) this past weekend.\n\nSometimes it's nice not to have too many options when dining out.  You know, like when you're attending someone else's event and they've already chosen a limited menu for the guests (including yourself) to make a selection from?  That way you can just focus on the others who are dining with you rather than salivating over every detail of the entire menu, going back and forth, trying to come up with the best possible way to taste as much as possible without stuffing yourself like a goose.  Ok, I'm totally lying.  I'd much rather scour the menu, up and down, imagining combinations of courses and anticipating what the real thing will bring compared to the vision in my head.  I mean, cummon!  That's almost the best part!  I love reading menus!  I even love reading them with no intention of eating.   \n\nBut that's not what I got to do this time.  Sigh.  Oh well.

Nothin' fancy but neither was the rest of the meal, intentionally.  Chilled steamed lobster, crab, prawns, mussels and clams as well as raw oysters rested on a bed of those cute, little mini ice cubes with a couple of sauces on the side for accompaniment.  It was good and honest and unadulterated.  That's Bouchon's style.  Once I read somewhere that Keller opened Bouchon (the one in Napa, of course) so that he'd have somewhere to eat after being at the French Laundry all night.  It's kind of a funny statement but one can only eat so much fancy food before they crave something uncomplicated and comforting.  And our meal at Bouchon was a true expression of that.\n\nAlong with the seafood was a plate of charcuterie which I found quite plain.  Just a few slices of barely differentiable salumi with some cornichons, pickled onions and dijon.  The little jars of salmon rillettes was a nice addition which is why I didn't understand the reason that they were hardly touched.  People are afraid of unfamiliar things, I guess.  Most Americans would rather just have the salami.  I'm sure someone in the kitchen was annoyed when the servers re-entered with 3/4-full jars of deliciousness to be tossed directly into the garbage.  I know I would be.\n\nThen came our chosen appetizer course.  My dining partner-in-crime and I ordered both options, of course.  I won.  Actually, the cauliflower veloute may have been my favorite thing on the table all night long.  It was ugly as hell, which you can see from the picture below, but very flavorful.  To account for its unappetizing color and depth of flavor, I assume that the cauliflower was roasted before being made into a soup since the server informed me that there was, in fact, no chicken stock in it.  Its green olive tapanade garnish lent a salty brightness to the smooth, mouth-coating veloute.  We both thoroughly enjoyed it, as did the other recipients of it at the table. \n\nBeet salad was our second appetizer and we both agreed that it needed help.  For me, it was just (naturally) overly sweet and could have benefitted from a salt or acid component (or more of what was already there).  The strategically composed bites of sweet beet, bright orange, toasty hazelnut and salty frisee were the best.  But the complimentary components were gone long before their protagonist, leaving us with a big pile of beets and nothing to eat them with.\n\nNow, please don't hold my entree order against me.  It is a very rare occasion that I find it appropriate to order chicken.  For the most part, I shake my head in disappointment at the chicken orderers of the world.  But that's because it is most often their safety net.  And if there is ever a time to order a half of a roasted chicken, I thought it would be at Bouchon where I was hoping to be delighted with browned, crispy skin and tender, juicy meat.  And it was almost there.  Nicely browned but not as juicy as I'd hoped.  Keller is a big believer in brining so I was expecting ridiculously juicy meat.  But it wasn't.  Better were the roasted oyster and shiitake mushrooms with fresh (yes, fresh) peas that my bird sat atop.  And I couldn't help but butter a thick-crusted baguette and let it rest in the plate's deep, rich sauce before devouring it.  I was very happy with that part.\n\nThe lamb loin was fine.  Nothing to write home about.  A perfect medium rare but not juicy which leads my to believe they used one of those temperature holding ovens.  I guess you can't expect them to sear off 15 orders of meat at once for a private party.  It was served simply with turnips and carrots (meh)....", "type": "review", "business_id": "tFU2Js_nbIZOrnKfYJYBBg"}

We finally made it to the long time coveted brunch at Bouchon and it did not disappoint. \n\nWe started with the special of the day appetizer: salmon tartare, good but not the best we've had.  Loved their bread with house- made butter and silky smooth jam. Caveat: don't overeat on the bread. Unfortunately, we made that mistake. \n\n I had their special of the day entree, an omelette with shrimp, mushroom sauce over a house made puff pastry. Yummy.  We also had the chicken & waffle which was delicious. It comes served with a vanilla bean butter and cinnamon maple syrup. The roasted chicken was moist and delightful in flavor and the waffles were light and scrumptious. Thomas Keller definitely does his chicken right. (Although nothing compares to the fried chicken from Adhoc.)\n\nMy friend had the croque madame which was covered with a mountain of frites. The frites were good but lacked the crunchy texture I usually like.  The brioche was of course drenched in butter but balanced with the salty flavors of the ham. We felt like it needed a citrus component. It wasn't our favorite dish of the day. Next time we may just go with 3 entrees among us 4. We were overly stuffed. \n\nWe will return again for dinner!

Boy, was I in for a treat at Wicked Spoon but an utter disappointment (to say the least) at Bellagio.\n\nThe prices don't differ much but more should be expected of the $30 Bellagio than the $27 Wicked Spoon (on weekends as well!) This was sadly not the case.\n\nThe hype surrounding the crab legs turned out to be a meh moment. True, they were pretty huge. It is easy to mistake brine water for freshness but the texture gave them away. I'd imagined crab meat in its luscious and chewy grandeur but they were more like less than chewy strands soaked in ice and seawater. (Wicked Spoon had limited crab w/ drawn butter and it tasted superior even when I was bloated)\n\nThe meat department fared only average imo. The alleged Kobe Beef was definitely not the kind that melts in your mouth. Although Wicked Spoon offers similar stuff, you do get more variety and at least the Galbi and Braised Short Ribs (at WS) were yummy.\n\nDessert: Oh don't get me started. WS throws its competition out of the window. How can Bellagio even compare? One would expect that the desserts should be worthy of Jean Phillipe Patisserie also in the hotel but that is far from true. The creme brulee was not bad but the cheesecakes and sorbets brought back horrific college dining hall memories. Compare this with: fresh strawberries and bite-size apples coated in amazing chocolate, shots of delicate mousse, a selection of delectable fudges and fresh, flavorful gelato at Wicked Spoon. For desserts alone, WS deserves 5 stars and I have to beat myself up to give Bellagio 2 stars.\n\n2 stars for: the service - efficient although it wasn't the best; the cranberry juice (I would hardly be lying if I said that was the best thing I had all night). \n\nMy only guess is WS is a new buffet building its name and the line was shorter (outrageous!). In a few years, I bet (that's what you do in vegas) the price, line and rating will far exceed Bellagio.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CZjcFdvJhksq9dy58NVEzw"}

I pretty much got the same stuff that I would've picked up at Flavors at Harrahs or Le Village at Paris for half the price.

So I already been to the buffet at the Wynn hotel so I was more then happy to try a different buffet. My friend suggested the one at bellagio and I though sure! A new place, a new yelp review!\n\nSo we head in, thank goodness we came early because there was no line to wait and pay but there was a wait time to get a table for 6??? I was a bit frustrated because there were open tables and they just didn't seat us. We finally got seated after about 10-15 minutes of waiting. \n\nUsually when I go to buffets, I'm starving so no surprise...when we got there I was HUNGRY! So I decided to circle around the area to see what they have. For Vegas buffet, I felt the the selections were very limited and there was much things that appealed to me. But, I was still manged to get a little of everything. \n\nThe taste was alright. It was able to get me full but I only scarf down 2 plates. I think the most enjoyable item was the pasta ravioli with truffle sauce. Besides that, it was alright. The food was okay, nothing really gave me a a wow factor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "CZjcFdvJhksq9dy58NVEzw"}

But we also ate really slow since the night before of course was filled with a little too much alcohol! They have a pesto mashed potatoes which is so good! They had rack of lamb and whole rotisierre chicken. When dinner items came out they of course have alaskan king crab legs and snow crab legs. The chicken noodle soup was perfect after a night of drinking. They also has Ostrich. I tried it out because I figured I'd never eat it anywhere else. Not bad. Tastes normal.

Made me feel closer to home.\n\nWhat did I have?\n\n1. Ahi and Salmon Poke: it was good considering we were 6,000 miles away from home.  It is comparable to a typical shoyu poke without the onions and had a little more spice to it.\n\n2. Prime Rib: the first buffet that actually gives you a true slice of prime rib...i'm not sure how many ounces it was but the piece they gave me was huge!!!  It was nice and moist and my favorite part about it was that it had a good amount of fat to it. =)\n\n3. Alaskan King Crab legs and Snow Crab legs:  i suggest you just eat the King Crab legs because they are larger and have more meat in it.  They are all already half cut so they are easy to eat.  Don't forget to grab a bowl of hot butter.\n\n4. Shrimp cocktail:  i always end up getting too much shrimp because they look sooo good.  \n\n5. Mussels:  not sure what kind of mussels but it was cooked in some type of red sauce which was pretty good.  If you could just add pasta to it, it would make a good mussell pasta.\n\n6. Steamed Sea Bass: if you're a fan of bass, this would be a good dish for you because it's steamed to the finest texture.\n\n7. Special Roll Sushi: It's just a vegetable roll wrapped with Ahi (Tuna) on top of it.  I would call it a poor man's rainbow sushi.  Good enough for a buffet.\n\n8.  Ahi and Salmon roll: there are your normal strip of ahi and salmon on top of rice.  Remember to grab some wasabi and soy sauce.\n\n9. Desserts: can't remember what I tried, but they had a wide variety of desserts.  I always end up getting the vanilla ice cream topped with nuts and caramel and fudge sauce...mmmmmmhmmmmm\n\nThere were a lot more dishes that I didn't name here that were available, the full menu should be available on the Bellagio website.\n\nThe plus that I liked about this buffet was that before paying for the buffet, the waitresses allow you to enter the buffet area to check out the food before you pay.  \n\nHope this helps and Enjoy!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "CZjcFdvJhksq9dy58NVEzw"}

The cheesecake, tiramisu, chocolate cake thingy, and non-brulee portion of the creme brulee didn't taste right.

The only other buffet I've been to in Vegas is the one at the Rio and I would rate both the food and the service at the Bellagio significantly higher.  I know the Wynn buffet is supposed to be awesome as well, but I haven't experience that one yet.\n\nWait:  We got there a little after 11:30 am and were seated by 12:45.  If you get there earlier, the wait would probably be shorter.\n\nPrice: We paid $30 for the brunch buffet, plus $5 for unlimited champagne.  That sounds pricey at first glance, but in my opinion it was totally worth it for the quality of the food and the quantity we ended up eating.  Also, $5 for unlimited champagne in Vegas is as good of a deal as you're going to get.\n\nService:  Very impressive for a buffet.  Water, coffee, and champagne were refilled promptly.  Our server did forget my friend's coffee request towards the end of the meal, but she eventually remembered and that was the only small issue.  I was pleasantly surprised with how attentive our server was.\n\nFood:  Very good for a buffet.  My friend and I came prepared and attacked the buffet with a plan.  We broke it down into breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert courses.  We were there for about 3 hours.  In retrospect this was pretty disgusting, but whatever.  I'm going to try to remember what I ate...\nBreakfast round:\n- Eggs benedict: Awesome.  The egg was perfectly cooked, and the hollandaise sauce was the perfect balance of buttery and lemon-y.\n- Bagel and lox: Always a good choice for brunch.  Their bagels weren't the freshest of bagels, but they were good.  The smoked salmon was lovely, and there were all the fixing you could ever want: tomatoes, red onion, capers, cream cheese.\n- Breakfast sausage:  A little dry, but tasty.\n\nLunch round:\n- Chicken biryani: Very good.  Awesome flavor, although it could have been spicier.  Chicken was very tender.\n- Spicy tuna cones:  Delicious!  A must-try.  Kind of a deconstructed spicy tuna roll, with tuna, rice, cucumber, etc, wrapped in a sushi wrap, but in a cone instead of a roll (resulting in much more tuna fitting in a single serving).  So so good.\n\nDinner round:\n- Lamb: Very flavorful and tender.  And they had an interesting mint jelly sauce that I loved, although I don't remember what was in it.\n- Spicy Thai beef:  I remember it being spicy, but that's really all I remember.\n\nDessert round:\n- Bread pudding:  Incredible.  I may be biased because I love bread pudding and I haven't had it in so long, but this bread pudding was awesome.  Creamy texture, light flavor.\n- Mini Key Lime Tartes:  Also very good, although not the best key lime I've had.\n- Mini Chocolate Mousse Cakes:  Awesome. Super chocolately with a nice fluffy texture.\n\nI know I'm forgetting a significant amount of the food I tried, but these are the things that stuck out in my mind.\n\nHighly recommend!", "type": "review", "business_id": "CZjcFdvJhksq9dy58NVEzw"}

A lot of people were in line for salmon and maguro poke but I stayed away from the raw seafood because it was a buffet after all.

Also available was the sopresata table (Italian cold cuts, various pickles including banana peppers). \n\nOther amazing options include roasted pheasant (seriously, when have you EVER had pheasant? I'll bet... Never), and wild mushroom fricase\u00e9 (seriously delicious - see my Melograno review). \nThere was at least 40% of the buffet we didn't even hit, because the tour de force of the entire experience met with my finite belly size (I ain't no Kobayashi, and I don't intend to dunk my food into water to help eat more, either). \n\nThe desserts also rocked. Even \"simple\" items like rice crispy treats, mango & papaya slices, and strawberries were sexed up with freshly dipped chocolate. \n\nThey also had caramel and candied apples; marshmallow lollipops dipped in, you guessed it, chocolate; holiday bread pudding; as well as an ice cream bar with all the fixings. \n\nWill need to eat plain oatmeal for the next month, but it was worth it.

The jello/champagne like shooters were icky tasting.  \n\nMy buffet experience here was rated against higher standards, but just keep this in mind:  avoid that pasta or it will kill you.  The price is definitely more affordable than the buffet at Bellagio with a nearly comparable selection of quality food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg"}

Since we were a large group (about 10 people), tip was included in our meal and we each paid $40 for the buffet. After dishing out so much, I definitely had high expectations.\n\nFirst thing I went for? The meat. I love prime rib and racks of lamb and man were they GOOD. The pastas were also surprisingly tasty, especially the pumpkin ravioli. Other good things were the veal and the desserts! OMG the desserts! There were so many choices and I wanted to eat everything! I ate so many macarons that I thought I would burst. There were also ice cream, many types of cakes, meringues, puddings, and so many other types of desserts. Definitely save room for the desserts.\n\nUnfortunately, the crab legs failed to impress me and after eating a few, I definitely lost interest. Maybe seafood isn't my thing. Also the creme brulee was runny but I didn't really mind since I love creme brulee. \n\nTo top off a great buffet experience, our waiter was so nice.

The pumpkin ravioli was strange, but still pretty good once you got used to it. The prime rib is perfection in how cooked it is (rare! so juicy), but I found it a little bit lacking in flavor on the inside (where it is most juicy and delicious).

The sushi is bleh... mostly California roll-type stuff, nothing special. I never get anything from the ready-made pasta counter because filling yourself up with carbs at a place like this doesn't seem worthwhile. Filling yourself up with crab legs, on the other hand... so worth it! They have a Thai curry station, too, which is really spiffy in my book. Finally, lobster pot pie? A delectable combination of two of my favorite foods: lobster, and pot pie. So awesome. Overall, the selection and quality of food is fantastic. Also, the desserts are really yummy.\n\nThe service is pretty good... drinks are refilled reasonably quickly, and plates are generally cleared away when you're gone (I never saw them clear the plates away but when I got back, they were gone). \n\nAnd yes, the lines are comparable to those at Disneyland... except that instead of some boring ride you get to stuff yourself until you're sick... and then some more after that.

WRONG!  The prime rib was bland, the seafood wasn't fresh, and the only meat really worth having was the Rack of Lamb- it was seasoned quite well and the meat fell off the bones!  The fish was alright- Salmon was overcooked.  I kept going back for cheese and savory hams!  So I thought, ok, the dessert should redeem my meal.  Well, unfortunately the only thing that met the internal standard of my palate was the Creme brulee- it was yummeeee!!  The other cakes were really blah- strawberry mousse, mango mousse, the carrot cake, the tiramisu was totally off!

The dessert selection was just terrible, kinda like the Golden Corral quality. Common, what's all this hype? I've tried just about every buffet restaurant in Vegas at the major casinos and only one stands out above all and that's the Bellagio hands down. They even give you silverware. The worst part of the Wynn buffet is the dessert selection, compare it to Bellagio, $27.95  and it'll speak for itself.  Why waste your money and not get what you pay for?  All in all It depends on what you like. \n\n           Everyone runs for the crab and prime rib and that's all there is to talk about there on the main meal. I was told there was gelato! what gelato? I know what gelato looks and taste like and they did not have any. Some people are making false statements about the food at the Wynn. They must have been too hungry to know the difference in food qualtiy. Sushi? ha, it was a total joke!  Your local grocery store has better. Common, are people supposed to be taken this stupid? They should leave out foods they do not know how to make. It leaves a bad taste to remember.

Lots of varieties from different ethnicity such as American, Italian, and Asian food. For Italian food, there's pasta entrees and Asian food had shrimp dumplings (dim sum) and sushi with raw smoked salmon. American food had prime rib, corn on the cob, potatoes, etc. My boyfriend had the best prime rib from here because it was rare just how he liked it. We're both seafood lovers, so we had a generous amount of crab legs and it was sliced in half so no need to worry about cracking the shells. It was also warm so it was just about right to enjoy the crab. The dessert section was something I couldn't end my dinner without. They had marshmallow lollipops (marshmallow dipped in white or chocolate with sprinkles on top) which I thought it was pretty cute and creative for a simple dessert. There were a lots of cupcakes, cakes, and gelato! If only my stomach could devoured it all, I would if I could. The mini red velvet cupcake really caught my eye since it was sprinkled with glitter and I had to get it! I loved it, the frosting itself tasted fresh with real ingredients of a cream cheese frosting. Must eat the crepes, I fell in love with their crepes.

Figuring I could use something to kill time, I picked one up and started perusing the contents.  On one of the pages was listed the top 10 buffets in Vegas.  I figured, \"Well, Rio has to be at the top with Bellagio 2nd and going on from there...\", but was surprised to see that Wynn was ranked #1, Rio #2, and Bellagio #4!!!\n\nSo I did some research and learned that the Wynn seems to be the new rage in buffets on the strip, so we decided to check it out.  We arrived at around 7 and waited for about 45 minutes before getting on a Saturday evening.  Not too unreasonable.\n\nWe were eventually seated and provided drink orders then went to town.  Here were some of the highlights:\n\nPre-cut cold King Crab legs - This is my favorite part of every buffet.  King is king, and if they are hot legs they are the best, but most buffets do cold legs to keep them lasting longer.  The line for the seafood was the longest in the buffet, and it was worth it.  When I finally got to the crab legs with my giant empty plate I started putting them on while a working behind the counter started gathering a ton of them in his gloved hand.  He then asked me if I wanted what he had collected on my plate.  I said yes, and instantly my collection of 3 legs with tongs turned into around 15.  I added a few more and got some drawn butter and the rest is history.  Awesome legs.\n\nBraised short ribs - Only slightly dry if not in the sauce, but the meat literally fell of the bone and shredded easily with a fork.  Very tender and flavorful.\n\nPumpkin Ravioli - I don't really like sweet food for dinner items, but these were excellently done with great texture and flavor.  The spice was really present and enhanced the item well.\n\nLamb Chop - Super tender and tasty.  Again, fall off the bone goodness.  A little fatty, but easily trimmed away.\n\nThe ice cream bar - It's like a Coldstone or a gelato bar... Tons of ice creams.  They also had crepes for those interested.\n\nI tried a little of everything, and these were the things that really stood out to me.  The rest was average and not overly impressive.  The thing is, I would want to compare this to Bellagio since it took the number one spot and highlight some of the differences between the two that might help you decide which is better for you.\n\nBellagio Pros:\nBetter variety (Beef Wellington, Venison or Buffalo, etc)\nLower price\nHigh quality\n\nWynn Pros:\nCrab legs are cut in half for easy access (if this applies to Bellagio, then forgive my forgetfulness and remove this item)\nLamb chops\nIce cream and crepe bar\n\nIn general, both have tons of desserts (of which most suck), and lots of standard items like salad, pasta, tacos, prime rib, etc.  The Wynn presentation for food was higher (nice pictures taken by one of my friends), but the Bellagio offers a better deal; better bang for the buck.\n\nSummary: Most of the food was good.  Some of the food was great (crab legs, short ribs, ice cream bar).  Food presentation was excellent.  But when it comes to overall deal for the price, it's not worth it.  Bellagio seems a better deal with greater variety and comparable quality for less.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg"}

My mouth waters everytime I think about this place. It's one of the more expensive buffets but their food is high in quality which makes the price worth every penny. The wait is generally always about an hour so it gives you additional time to build up that big appetite and prep you for battle. \n\nThey have a great variety of food selections but I almost always go for the king crab legs and prime rib first. Most buffets will just give you any slice of meat but here, they'll cook the slab well done on one side and rare on the other giving you an option for some bloody-delicious meat. Lots of great tasting food but what really gets me coming here is their dessert selections. Specifically their infamous creme brulee...soooo sooo yummy! It's always perfect everytime and I swear I could eat 3-4 all on my own :)\n\nVegas is definitely known to have some of the best buffets, and yelpers, this is one of their best!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg"}

The only area where I thought the selection could have been better was the salad bar, but who would ever want to eat salad at such a buffet? \n\nThe Alaskan king crabs are probably the finest items served at the buffet.

Blintzes and little quiches and frittatas. I adored the individual fruitcups, especially the bright pink, fresh grapfruit with a little mint. They had a BAGEL bar!! and a GRANOLA bar!! with the best fresh toasted pecans *everrrr*. The boy and I hoarded a bunch for the flight - what in the hell were on these pecans? They were so good!\n\nBest of all was the DESSERT room which was assuredly open in its cute little room!!!! One side had tons of breakfast pastries, with some desserts like an amazing vanilla cupcake with strawberry buttercream!!! Sooo good. There were also chocolate covered rice krispee squares! The other side had pies and cake, this awesome peanut butter mouse cake, and a delicious pumpkin spice bar.\n\nThey had lunch food out too - mexican (including a vegan burrito), asian foods (like dumplings and such), and some other roasted meat-type products (can you tell I'm veg yet?)\n\nService was non-stop, and the waitress gave me my coffee to go! I think what also makes this place so great is the simplicity - brightly lit, so all the colors of the food come out. There is a high presence of the cooks every where, constantly bustling. Also the organization is a lot less stressful, and makes for a great experience. \n\nThis place rocked. I am seriously splurging for dinner next time. !!!

We went to the dinner buffet twice and the breakfast buffet once as included in our stay package. That being said...PROS: I liked that there was a huge selection of food types and an even grander array of desserts. The crepes (dessert) made to order at dinner were great. Service was friendly . CONS: I was not overly impressed with any food item (except the crepes). Everything else was just ok. The shellfish selection was limited. I had my share of crab legs and small shrimp. They did not have oysters, at least during our week (end of Jan). The desserts looked better than they tasted. I walked away stuffed so its hard to really complain.

However, their creme burlee was awesome!!\n\nOur plates were mainly the meat and king crab legs... can't really say it was worth it.........", "type": "review", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg"}

Just go here.  It's one of the better buffets on the strip.\n\nI will spend a little more time talking about my general take on it.\n\nLOCATION:\n\nThe Wynn casino seems a bit further out (especially if you are walking around) from what I call the \"heart\" of the Vegas strip (Bellagio, Ceasers, Paris) so if you are closer to the Bellagio, then I really don't think there are that many differences when it comes to the food.\n\nWhat is nice about the Wynn is that I think that there is generally less traffic at the Wynn compared to the Bellagio and the buffet location is tucked away further from the casino floor traffic.  This isn't to say that there isn't a line, but there are few casinos that don't.\n\nFOOD:\n\nMulti national cuisine (but it slants on the side of having a lot more Asian dishes). but there are enough options for even the most picky eaters (meat and potatoes kinda people).\n\nDesserts are fancy to look at and don't be ashamed that your plate has 6 types of desserts.....EVERYBODY is loading up.\n\nCATTLE LINE?:\n\nUnlike the lines waiting to get into the buffet, you don't necessarily feel that way when you go to each station to get your food.  It's pretty open and I never feel like I am queuing up.\n\nWANNA EAT CHEAP?:\n\nWorried about how much your meal is going to be and feel like winning some money that will take less than 3 minutes of gambling time (minus the cash out at the casino cage?)\n\nForget the slots, forget blackjack....I'm talking QUICKER....your are frickin' hungry, man.\n\nHere is what I usually do.\n\nGo to the \"money wheel\" on the casino floor. \n\nPut $20.00 on number \"1\".  Win?  Get 20.00 bucks profit.\n(it usually hits more often than not.  You get even money back.  Don't focus on what you could win, you goal is to double up your money).\n\nLose?  Put 40.00 down and go again.\n\nBam....your buffet is now half price!\n\nWanna get your buffet for free?  \n\nPress you bet on 1 again.  Win?  You got your meal paid for, son.\n\nThere you go...you either saved 50% or a full 100% of your meal ticket.\n\nIf you strike out, don't worry...you were gonna blow that money anyways.  \n\nThe upside is that it will give you even more motivation to eat as much as you can to get your money's worth.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg"}

Took my sister in law there and we have very different tastes in food.  Despite this, we both left very happy with the meal.  If only her flight was later as she was still pounding away on those crab legs.\n\nI hate crab - and love red meat.  So I went initially with the prime rib (good and especially love the more well done and crispy/fatty outer part), a veal short rib that was spectacular, and the salmon rillette on toast.  The salmon was delicious and the toast was constantly replaced so nice and crunchy on the outside/soft on the inside.\n\nYou're not supposed to have bread at buffets but nobody tells me what to do.  And I heard the baker at Wynn was some big shot European guy they hired for huge dough.  Had their artisan bread - excellent!  \n\n2nd go around  I basically had a 2nd serving of what I had the first time (minus prime rib).  That's the reason I give it 4 stars - the variety is somewhat lacking for me.  You go to somewhere like the M Buffet or even Bellagio and there's just more variety.  If you don't like some of the dishes (like pasta at a buffet is useless for me) then you're really stuck with only a few things.\n\nIn any case, service was great and my sister in law loved all the healthier stuff like crab and fruit.  I liked the fruit too.\n\nNeither of us was big on dessert but they did have a nice marshmallow \"lollipop\" that wasn't bad and a rasberry mousse with champagne that was very nice.  \n\nBit pricey - but tough luck you're at the Wynn.

After eating at Wicked Spoon which charges $27 for dinner one would think the Wynn would offer something spectacular.  The display of the food was boring, the variety was non existent and the taste of the food wasn't very good.  For example the pad thai didn't taste like a pad thai, the turkey was way too dry, the clam chowder looked like goo, and the only thing that was half way decent was the ice cream.  \n\nThis buffet was once the best buffet on the strip but it got complacent.

I can't really remember since it was three days ago and I'm suffering from early onset Alzheimer's.  In any case, I said \"Hell yes!\"  Big mistake.  \n\nOn to the review:  my recommendation is to go early if you're serious about eating mass quantities.  We got there around 5:30 and the line was already starting to form.  Seating was near the front, away from the buffet.  Not a bad thing since I needed to burn a couple extra calories to pack some more prime rib in.   Waiter dropped by and took our drink order, then on to the food!\n\nThe Wynn is great in both variety and quality in my opinion.  The prime rib was a perfectly cooked medium rare, au jus not too salty and very beefy and the straight horseradish packed a punch.  The roast lamb with a little mint jelly was good, a little overcooked.  The line for the seafood at that time of day was not too bad.  Crab legs with a little clarified butter?  Don't mind if I do!  White anchovy salad? Please!  Smoked salmon?  Yes!   Skipped the pasta bar and the salads, although they both looked good.  Dessert was spectacular.  A dozen types of gelato, the coconut was great.  Honestly, the other sweets were a blur but more on that later.\n\nThe downside:  the cheese and charcuterie section only had three types of cheese and meat; all very good though.  The sushi section was woefully undermanned.  I saw that poor girl slicing away frantically trying to keep up with all the demand.  \n\nMy downfall was, of course, all you can drink alcohol.  Not that I got drunk and made a fool of myself.  I had the hubris to think that I could tackle BOTH the buffet and all you can drink in one sitting!  Total rookie mistake but I'm not a rookie!

It's pricey, but I think it's worth it if you come right before they switch over to the dinner price. That way you pay lunch price and catch the beginning of the dinner food service :))\n\nI've been here for dinner three times: once on a weekend, once on a weekday, and once on Thanksgiving. I always came pretty early, before 5pm, so the lines are never that long. Except on Thanksgiving. Truly horrendous. \n\nThe buffet food is awesome! Aside from the crab legs and prime rib that everyone always loves, they also have great fish and pasta dishes. Presentation is beautiful, and they portion a lot of the entree foods for you. \n\nMy favorite part is the soup bar! Their soups are delightful! I know it's probably stupid to stuff yourself with soup at a $40 buffet, but I really can't help myself. The soups they have are sweeter, and I always find myself craving them. In fact they're the reason I keep returning to this buffet. A lot of people miss the soup bar because it's in the back near the breads salads and cheese at the end of the buffet people don't usually spend much time. \n\nThe dessert bar is so cute! I always get too greedy here. My favorite is the crepe station. YUM! They also have a fair selection of ice cream/gelato/sorbet :))\n\nDefinitely try The Buffet at the Wynn if you ever find yourself on the Strip, if only just once.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg"}

They even have an area that is mainly vegetarian. One of the things that I really liked about the buffet was the seafood and the meat selection. I had the brisket, which was delicious, and the king crab was also realllly tasty. When I first came I opted to skip out of a having some salad, but then as I made my way down the line I came across a variety of salads in little glass cups. There was probably about 6-7 different varieties. I tried the one with pears, which was absolutely delicious. The flavors came together really well, and it was overpowering in the sweetness of the pears. Another item that I really enjoyed was the pulled pork with coleslaw that was on top of something similar to cornbread. The pork was really tender and moist paired well for the coleslaw.\n\nSome of the items were not as tasty though. When I saw the pad thai it looked like it would be full of flavor, but when I tried it I found it to be bland. There was another item that I believe was called \"sicilian pizza\" which I tried because I wanted to try something new. It consisted on a thick layer of hard bread, dried out tomato sauce, and cheese that had hardened over form being left over too long. Needless to say, it wasn't good and it just tasted like bread.\n\nThe dessert area was also filled with a variety of different items. There are about 8 different gelato flavors, but they taste more like ice cream rather than gelato. However, the gelato comes in these adorable pastel colored cups. There are also candied apples, but they are extremely hard to take a bite into, and wouldn't be something that I would try again. Another item that I wouldn't try again would be the dipped marshmallows. There are marshmallows that are dipped in chocolate or white chocolate, but the flavors are too phenomenal.\n\nThe overall service from workers was pretty good. The servers were attentive with filling up our drinks and asking if there was anything else that they would do. The ambiance was also nice, because right when you walk in you see all these bright flowery colors. However, this is only when you walk in, once you get past that the setting is relatively normal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YNQgak-ZLtYJQxlDwN-qIg"}

I tried several other of their dishes, but each was a complete disappointment to the palete.  Little to no seasoning on anything.  I do have to say though, that the presentation is totally adorable and that is the only reason they get a star.  We tried the frittata, yuck, bland and no flavor.  Eggs benedict wasn't even appealing to sight.  Eggs were runny and no flavor and the breakfast meats were just ok.  We had hoped that as they switched out breakfast to lunch that the selections would be better, and the answer was a HUGE NO.  My husband said that if we had paid for the lunch price, we would have asked for a refund.  All I have to say is if you want some amazing food, where pretty much all of the selections are tasty and appealing, then head over to the Carnival World buffet, NOW that is worth the cost.  Don't let the Wynn's beauty deceive you into to beleiving that the food would be just as beautiful.

As I was waiting with my group, I looked up on Yelp and when I saw people saying they were waiting in line for over an hour, I judged the length of my line and thought maybe 20 minutes tops.  Boy, was I wrong.  They were seating a party about every 3 minutes.  I'll give them the benefit and say that it was probably due to their limited seating, and hope that it is not simply the staff's inefficiency. \n\nThe offerings at the buffet itself were not very 'French' as per the assumed theme this buffet was projecting.  Most of the spoon handles had been in use for too long (and looked like they were given to a teething infant for a few hours and felt just as sticky as you can imagine).   The food that those instruments dished up was bland, and not very appealing.\n\nI will say our server kept on top of our drinks (non-alcoholic), but missed the plates.  The whole staff just seemed over-loaded by the crowds and like they had never experienced such an amount of patrons in their restaurant at a time.  Really confused as to what this was all about since our server mentioned to us that this happens all the time.  Well, then prepare for it a little more!\n\nAs stated previously, totally not worth your wait in line.  While you're waiting there, look over the reviews of the Bellagio buffet, and if you can cough up a few dollars more, ditch this line and head across the street.

Standard buffet fare and some non-standard selections as well. Most people gravitate to the crab legs at buffets, I'm more of a prime rib kinda gal. The prime rib here was pretty good. I admit, I grabbed some of the mushroom sauce meant for the Chateaubriand instead of the au jus. I think it was a good choice. \n\nOther items I had were the brussel sprouts (don't judge me), kielbasa and sauerkraut, chicken with a wine/mushroom sauce. All very, very good. Desserts were plentiful. I tried a creme brulee and a puff thing that I have no idea what it was called but it was damn good.\n\nI'm not sure I liked this buffet enough to pay the single visit price and wait in the usually long line. I had purchased the \"Buffet of Buffets\" deal, so it was worth it in this case. \n\nThe food is very good, service was great. As soon as I went up for dessert, a staff member came by and offered me coffee. It's like she read my mind. If you're a multiple plate buffet champ, it's probably worth the wait and the price.

Luckily if you go to the Diamond club entrance they let you pay $10 per person to cut in front of the line.  Paying the $10 is well worth it.  However I do have a warning to give.  The staff in there is super RUDE! I don't know if everyone in there was having a bad day or if they were just trying to be in character, but they wouldn't make arrangements for us to sit with the rest of our party ( who paid separately) and the hostess practically left us behind making it hard to follow her.  Our drink server was nice but forgetful.  However, they did keep the bubbly coming and always made sure my glass was full :)  The food was pretty okay.  Some of the meats were dry but the pasta selection was pretty good.  The Crepe station was nice- I got nutella with bananas and strawberries- it pretty much rocked!

We got in about 40 minutes later and stayed until 1 pm.  I really enjoyed the variety of foods here, especially the large selection of desserts.\n\nI went directly first to the crepe line, since I know it's popular.  It was pretty good, but very sweet.  You get to pick what goes in your crepe, and I chose blueberries, strawberries, and banana.  Only the banana was fresh.  The berries were just preserves.  Someone asked if they had fresh berries/fruit, and the lady (1 lady making tons of crepes for everyone in line), said they hadn't had fresh fruit in a while. \n\nI then went over and looked at the desserts and got an omelet made.  It was a standard omelet with nothing exciting, though the guy who made our omelets was really friendly.\n\nI LOVE seafood and was very pleasantly pleased to find a lox (cream cheese and smoked salmon on a bagel) station.  There were bagels, cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers.  I loaded my plate and really enjoyed my lox more than anything else.  I wish I had room to eat more of it, but I sadly discovered this station at the end.\n\nI thought it was pretty cool that they also had a little Mediterranean station.  I was too full by then to try anything from there.  And by about noon, I saw people started stacking their plates with crab legs for lunch. Not sure if they had those out earlier, but I sure didn't notice people with them during my first round.  I stuck to the breakfast stuff, since I could only get that once a day.  \n\nI don't know why, but I really liked this place a lot.

This time around, significantly less veggies (yes I know a lot of people don't go to buffets for veggies), and neither of my favorite dishes.

But they weren't very good.  Mushy.  Yuck.\n\nA lot of things are mislabeled here.  Some are just funny.  Parmesan cheese was labeled as red onion.  But then mayo was labeled as tzatziki, which angered me. (Holly smash!) I dipped some pita in it and ate it before I realized it was not tzatziki.  I hate it when buffets mislabel things.\n\nThey did have Mediterranean selections, which surprised me.  But you need to hunt for the good stuff.  They had a basket of pita that was stale and nasty.  But elsewhere in the station, they had nice hot fresh pita.\n\nThere are restrooms in the buffet but the ladies room is one stall and completely useless.  Just plan on using the restrooms outside as you come and go.\n\nNot really impressed with this buffet given the hype.", "type": "review", "business_id": "rBPQuQgTcMtUq5-RYhY2uQ"}

However, if you have the time and energy, I recommend checking out one of the other buffets on the strip such as Wynn or Bellagio.\n\nWe had the Buffet of Buffets pass, so we could go to 8 buffets in 24 hours that are all part of the Harrah's casino chain.  (No we didn't make it to all 8, but oh did we try!)  Le Village is the little brother of buffets on the strip, with more limited offerings and a smaller seating area.  \n\nThe wait wasn't too bad, so if you hate lines you might have a better chance of getting in quick here.  Although I have generally found that the longer the line the better the buffet!  When we were seated and started our multiple rounds of plate filling and emptying I found that a lot of the stations were slow to re-stock.  It was about 8:00, and they close at 10:00, so I think they stopped replacing the food in order to reduce throw-away.  Makes sense, but still disappointing since I am not one of those people who come back from the the buffet counters with the leaning tower of food stuffs on my plate.  By the time I went to get some of the dishes, it was only to find that they had run out.\n\nGoing off the assumption that Paris is a French place, and Le Village sounded distinctly French, I planned to go directly to the foods that were hard to pronounce expecting to be wowed by something more unique than the standard Prime Rib that all buffets have.  \n\nRatatouille - Not bad for a vegetarian dish.  It had a little spice and heat to it which made it very flavorful.  Since my only prior experience with Ratatouille was the mouse movie I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nCrepes - Yes, everyone has crepes these days, but they are admittedly very good here!  The crepe chef wasn't French, but I will give them a pass on that one.\n\nChateaubriant sauce - This French sounding sauce goes with the non-French sounding beef tri-tip and was absolutely amazing.  Viva le fusion!\n\nFrench Onion Soup - It is right there in the name everyone.  However I have had much better at local restaurants here in LA.  And since it is buffet style, it was missing the cheese covered topping on the bowl that I associate and love with this dish.\n\nSauteed Mushrooms - A very simple dish and pretty universal, but they used some amazing marinade that really kicked it up a notch.  I made two trips for these guys before they ran out and never re-stocked them.\n\nCrab - A staple in all great buffets, was practically non-existent.  Don't go here if you are looking for great seafood in general.\n\nThe rest of the food was either at or below par with other buffets, so nothing to really comment on.  To re-iterate my initial assessment, this place will work in a pinch, but if you have the time and energy, try one of the bigger buffets on the strip and eat up!", "type": "review", "business_id": "rBPQuQgTcMtUq5-RYhY2uQ"}

Outside, you see pictures of celebrities that have eaten at Hash House.  The main reason I decided to visit Hash House was because of the raving reviews Adam Richman gave on Man vs. Food.  Adam, your credibility is seriously on thin ice with me after my experience here.\n\nHash House is located inside the Imperial Palace hotel along the strip.  Is it just me or does this place feel cold and unclean?  \n\nService here was also iffy.  It took our waitress a while for her to come over and take our drink orders and the restaurant wasn't even full.  She also disappeared at the end of our meal after she dropped off our check.  Then, she charged us an extra $2.50 for a split plate!  Ridiculous.  If I could give a negative star on service, I would.\n\nHash House is all presentation.  Their dishes come out looking massive!  Andrew D. and I ordered the chicken eggs benedict and I was SERIOUSLY disappointed.  Eggs benedict is my FAVORITE breakfast meal, but the dish SERIOUSLY lacked flavor and kick.  I was waiting for my taste buds to be stimulated, but alas, it was bland.  I ended up having to season the thing to the best of my ability with the tabasco sauce, ketchup and black peppers we had at the table.\n\nOur whole group left feeling unsatisfied and a little bitter for having to waste our money on this place.

This I would understand if it was busy, or a weekend, or whatever - not a Wednesday morning when more than half the place is empty. So after waiting for our friends we go BACK up and get seated. I was getting the shakes by then bc I needed food so bad and just ordered and waited. Really couldn't care less about the place until I got my food. Ordered an Apple Juice for my drink and it was really good. It tasted like it was freshly pressed. The order came and yes, it was huge, but stop looking at the size people and realize that they put almost 2in high of mashed potatoes under EVERYTHING. Oh, and one thing I wasn't happy about, they don't list what is actually on/in the dish. They didn't mention that it had a type of salsa on top, or that it was on top of mashed potatoes. What if I had an allergy??? Not good!\n\nSo anyway, yes portions were HUGE, but frankly I've had better. Maybe it was just what I ordered, but I won't exactly be rushing to this place anytime soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xfwRO04KbAPw_zRotCfWQQ"}

The portions here are ginormous! I ate like a pig, but felt like a cow. I guess that's keeping with the farm theme. \n\nThe first time I ate here I had the corned beef hash. Freakin' bomb. I've recommended it to two other people and it was a hit for both of them! \n\nThis time around I had Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, which was pretty good too. I'm not going to go into it because other people have described it thoroughly. It really looks like a hot mess and I'm sure some Top Chef judge would probably be appalled by the busyness of the dish. I think all food groups were covered in this dish. Thought I could tackle this thing, but only ate half. You'd probably have to share this meal with someone or you'll end up with leftovers (which isn't always a bad thing!) \n\nThe mango coconut pancake is something that I probably will have every time I eat here. When I told our server that I was ordering it for my three year-old, she said, \"It's pretty huge.\" I replied, \"Yup, we're sharing it!\" Even though it was a shared piece, we still went home with half of it. \n\nI failed to mention that perhaps the main reason why I couldn't eat all of my food was because I had a Blood Mary.

One or two small items, no problem, but everything going poorly? Not good.\n\nI ordered the chicken and asparagus hash with eggs, and my girlfriend ordered the fried chicken and waffles. We didn't receive our food for at least 30 minutes, and when it came out, only mine came. The server said: \"We're going to start you with the chicken and asparagus hash,\" like it was an appetizer or something. Funny.\n\nAfter at least five minutes and my girlfriend's food having not arrived, I tried to find our waiter, but he was nowhere to be found. I flagged down another waiter and asked to see a manager. He arrived a couple minutes later and I asked him where my girlfriend's order might be, and he assured me it would be right out. Several minutes later, my girlfriend's fried chicken and waffles arrived.\n\nThe food: The coating was delicious, as was the maple syrup reduction. The chicken was very, very dry, however, and the waffles were soggy. My dish lacked seasoning and was actually quite bland.

The waiting area was pretty small, but it was fun looking at the autographed pictures of celebrities that they had on their wall, such as Penn and Teller, Ne-Yo, and Neil Patrick Harris. \n\nMelissa was our server. She was alright, but not the greatest. It took a while for her to greet us and take our orders, but I understand that they were extremely busy.

That's funny, it was our first visit here as well and she never bothered to ask us that!\n\nMy husband and I decided to share the chicken and waffles. We also ordered two sides - bacon and the biscuits and gravy to avoid the $2.50 split plate charge. \nJust an FYI: yes, they charge $2.50 if you are splitting plates, but you can avoid it if you order a side dish.\nI have to say, the presentation of our food and everyone else's around us was nice and pretty! But, I wasn't impressed. The chicken was dry, and even though the waffles looked awesome because they had strips of bacon cooked into them, it didn't taste that great.

Overall, we were pretty satisfied with the meal.  The biscuits and gravy were great.  My corned-beef hash dish came out a tad cold.  But the Hash House is really about quantity over quality, with portions ranging from large to HUGE.\n\nUnfortunately, our entire experience was ruined by a group of douchebags sitting at a nearby table.  It was 10am, and they were clearly drunk, probably having gotten started the night before (It IS Vegas, after all).  They were incredibly loud and disruptive, dropping F-bombs, N-bombs (they were NOT African American, by the way), and other ethnic slurs just to make sure every race was covered.\n\nAll the while, the restaurant management did nothing.  We know for a fact that the manager on duty heard all the noise, because serving station was nearby and he actually brought us much of our food.  The wait staff, many of whom must have been insulted by the cussing and racist comments, said nothing.  Despite the fact that families with children, couples, and tables of mixed ethnicity were all sitting nearby, no one from the restaurant staff made any effort to ask these jerks to keep it down or to at least tone down their language.  Was it really up to us to confront these obnoxious people if we wanted to eat in peace?  Was the management going to just stand by and say nothing until someone made a stink about it?  I guess so...\n\nThey guys left before anyone confronted them, but the damage was done.  I think a restaurant owner or manager who truly cares about his/her customers would have done something about it rather than let 4 or 5 losers completely ruin a meal for the 20+ people around them.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xfwRO04KbAPw_zRotCfWQQ"}

We were seated right away on a Friday night, but then sat for the next 20 minutes watching servers walk by when someone finally noticed us. I could tell the server knew we had been waiting a while when she noticed that we didn't even have water. She asked if we wanted to just order as no one had bothered to see if we wanted drinks. I ordered a coke and the chicken and waffles. After another 10 minutes we finally got our drinks. Another 5 minutes later they brought us biscuits which were big and looked good, but ended up being dry and kind of tasteless. They did bring the equivalent of about 1 pat of butter and a tiny bit of honey (imagine a McDonald's honey \"spread\" container). It just wasn't enough for four adults. Then after another pretty decent wait (our server came and reassured us twice that our food was coming up), the food came. I have to say that everyone's entree looked awesome. After we took photos, something I have never done at a restaurant, we dug in.....\n\nMy first bite made me gag a little bit. Imagine as a kid experimenting with the food in the door of the refrigerator: maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic powder, green onion? No matter how you combine these things they are not going to mesh well on a waffle with bacon. Ok, I understand the spin on chicken and waffles, but when this is your signature dish and it tastes like shit-something is wrong. The waffles were inedible-thick and doughy. The bacon was limp. The chicken was cold and dry. I basically just picked at the deep fried green onions and spaghetti noodles and took the 1/4\" thick breading off of the chicken and had some protein. \n\nThe other diners in our party didn't like their dish either; the pork cutlets. The bastards at HH even charged them $2.50 for splitting a meal that could have fed eight people. Needless to say, we didn't take any leftovers home.\n\nOne last warning for good measure: if you are sensitive to MSG, don't order the waffles. The soy sauce in the dish contains MSG. I get a huge headache when I have even little bit and this must have had lots. \n\nI was totally disappointed with the whole experience.

But at a certain point, it's just kind of wasteful. I can't believe this is me saying that, but Hash House took me there. \n\nThe Sage Fried Chicken was delicious. I wish it weren't just breasts, though...moist, juicy thighs are where its at. I know what you're thinking, and cut it out. The tower of bacon waffles? Delicious, but why a tower? Who's gonna eat all these waffles? And don't get pissy when we need more syrup! \n\nThe Grilled Meatloaf Hash was pretty good. Lots of meatloaf, fried potatoes, and red and yellow peppers. Huge amount of this hash next to a little mound of two scrambled eggs. I really like my eggs, and I felt bad that they were so outnumbered. Three eggs and half as much hash would suit me fine. \n\nThe Bacon Bloody Mary. For the love of all that does not suck....I wanted to love it. I had so been looking forward to it. I don't know what the frig is going on in this world, but it seems to be a recent trend that everyone feels the need to make their Bloody Mary spicy as all hell. Hash House isn't just along for that ride, they bought the damned airline. IMO, Tabasco should *accent* the flavors in a Bloody, waking the whole thing up, leaving behind a slight spicy flavor that pleasantly lingers....it should not be a dominant, overwhelming aftertaste without the drink being ordered that way. Kind of like everything else here, it's just too over the top without needing to be so. \n\nService was just fine, although I didn't quite dig the practice of going ahead and adding 18 percent gratuity under the line \"large party\". Since it was just two of us, they were either insulting us by calling us large, or insulting us because we're cheapskates that used their gift certificate offer on restaurants dot com. Either way, unappreciated. I'm in the industry, and you have to really suck to not get 20 percent and have that rounded up to the next dollar....even more if you don't suck.

The menu ranges from run of the mill (eggs, bacon and toast) to original masterpieces (snickers pancakes), of course there is room for plenty of crazy as well (O'Hare of the Dog, which consists of a 24oz Budweiser and a side of bacon). I loved the drink choices, lots of creative mimosas! Hash House will become a new tradition for Saturday morning, I can't wait to return.

While the rest of my party who went here may not have liked what they ordered, I loved the food. \n\nWe went here because the driver of the other car, who was the organizer of the trip, saw it on tv on Drivers, Dine-Ins, and Dives, and said it looked good. \n\nWe arrived in Vegas and set about finding this restaurant based on general directions from the other driver. Honestly, if you're not paying attention to the signs on the right side of the road (heading eastbound on Sahara) you can easily miss this location. The location opens at 730, and we arrived here at about 6am. We pretty much spent an hour and a half sleeping in the car. \n\nThe menu is simple, however it would do good to have photos of all that you would be ordering. What you may not realize when you first come to this restaurant is that the portions are very generous. \n\nWhat I mean by this is that two of our people ordered a pancake combination. When you order pancakes, you think that they'd be like IHOP pancakes or like McDonald's hotcakes, but this thing, according to the server, was about the size of a medium pizza. He sure as hell wasn't kidding! I mean, that thing was the size of a newborn! Two people shared one of the pancake platters, and the other person gave up on eating the pancake without eating it. (I wolfed the whole thing down in about two minutes for him) \n\nTwo other people ordered a Hash House combination plate, which I believe was hashed potatoes and some green pepper and sausage pieces. One ate most of it, the other person finished only a small portion of it, and shared with the rest of the people on our side of the booth.\n\nMy coworker ordered a waffle platter, and finished only one corner of a waffle and part of his hashed potatoes. He saved the rest in case we were hungry later on in the day. \n\nThe driver of the other car ordered what I believe was Andy's Sage Fried Chicken. When it came out, it looked about the size of a small child's head. The chicken portion that I cut through (to get a bite) was boneless and covered in a delicious sauce. With my help and the help of some of the other people on the table, we finished a little under half of the platter. \n\nThe item that I ordered was the One Pound Hash House Mushroom and Swiss Stuffed Burger with a side of Fries. When the burger came out, It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. The hamburger patties had the swiss/mushroom mixture oozing out of the middle, and it pretty much dwarfed the hamburger bun. It came with the fries, about four fried spaghetti sticks, and around the plate, there was this caramel type texture sauce. Even with the help of three other people, we only managed to eat under half of the burgers. \n\nThe restaurant began to get much more busier by the time we left, as more persons were beginning to come in to eat the food. The server was very pleasant and came by pretty often to check up on us. \n\nThe next time i go up there, i'm definitely going to stop by here and put myself into another food coma.

We opted to do the manly thing and sit in the bar area. Service was great from the bartender.  Ordered was the Ham/Egg Burger $11.95, Spinach salad $8.95 (for some roughage) and the Mac & Cheez $2.95. \n\nThe best thing of the lunch was expelling it from my body the next morning. Sorry, but true. Okay, the fries were good. But this place is such a facade. Facade in that the dishes look appealing and are huge portions, but below the service sits mediocre food. \n\nThe Spinach Salad was over dressed with the raspberry vinegrette to the point that it was sickening sweet. The burger was just a mess. The ham added nothing to the taste and just added to create an even larger mess amongst all the ingredients. The mac-n-cheese was penne pasta with what seemed like a cheap cheese smothering everything. \n\nSo I'm guessing that a lot of the 4 and 5 star reviews are from hungover breakfast patrons who get blinded by the large portions and appealing plating and just are hungry to the point that they really aren't out for flavor and quality.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xfwRO04KbAPw_zRotCfWQQ"}

Ya, definitely not getting that one chef. \n\nMy wife wanted to order hash, which is why we went to HASH House a Go-Go, as hash is traditionally served with poached eggs, and they only serve it with scrambled eggs with dinner. WHAAAA? So it's okay to have poached eggs for breakfast but not for dinner.  Hmmph. \n\nI had the chicken and biscuits. The gravy was schmeh. Yep, just schmeh. The chicken was tougher than a boiled owl. The asparegus was so tough that I couldn't even cut it with a steak knife. The only good thing about the meal were the biscuits. They were very good.\n\nOne of the more disappointing dining experiences I've had in a while. With so much talk about how amazing this place was I expected a lot more. Not a very value friendly place either. \n\nNo no for the Go Go.", "type": "review", "business_id": "xfwRO04KbAPw_zRotCfWQQ"}

In Vegas, your greatest weakness or vice becomes the source of all your pleasures. We were ready to give into our carnal desires and get down and dirty, indulging our voracious, gluttonous appetites. We wanted to get stuffed with something Hot N Juicy. \n\nHot N Juicy is known for their seafood: crab (Dungeness, blue, snow), shrimp, and of course, crawfish. You pick the type of seasoning (Juicy Cajun, garlic butter, lemon pepper or the Hot n Juicy Special) and the level of spiciness (mild, medium, spicy or extra spicy). \n\nWe ordered 2 lbs of snow crab legs and 2 lbs of crawfish with Juicy Cajun at medium, 2 pieces of corn, 2 red potatoes, etouffee (a Cajun seafood stew, similar to gumbo), and a side of sweet potato fries. Eating at Hot N Juicy is not an elegant refine affair. It's messy work because they dump a plastic bag of whatever seafood you ordered and you're only protection is the plastic table covering and a plastic bib. You open the bag and dig in.\n\nThe crab meat was very sweet and juicy. It was perfectly cooked. I found that the spiciness of the food depended on the type of seafood because the seasoning is on the outside of the shell. The meat isn't spicy unless you soak it in the sauce first. I found the level of spiciness in the crawfish much higher because the tail meat was much smaller and there was more shell around it, unlike the crab meat where I could pull out large pieces of meat out of the shell. Also I got more spicy sauce from the crawfish because I sucked crawfish heads. After a while my lips got tingly and numb from the Cajun spices. \n\nI've never had crawfish whole before. I only had them de-shelled. While I love crawfish and the meat was great, I'll never have them whole like that again. The tail meat is rather tiny (I like 'em big -- size matters when it comes to these things). At the end, we looked at the mountain of shell and agreed that it was more work than it was worth. Crawfish is mostly shell and I'd rather pay someone to shell them for me.\n\nEtouffee was a spicy rice seafood stew. I liked the flavor and the level of spice was just perfect for me. I thought the rice was a tad overcooked and mushy from just sitting in a pot all day, but in general it was enjoyable.\n\nThe boiled red potatoes were much needed as a break from the relentless Cajun spice. They were nice and sweet. The corn is out of season, so not as sweet and juicy as in the summer, but still tasty. The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty.\n\nThe final price for all of us was $30/person for three people. We gorged ourselves on great seafood and left utterly satiated. Happy ending for us indeed.\n\nWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But this is one of the few times where you wish you could get crabs and bring them home with you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YrIfgzLj0DPStJ1ESAS_Qg"}

You then choose the type of seasoning you want for your crawfish and how spicy you want it.  We went with the Hot N Juicy special seasoning and Hot heat level, which was very delicious.  The Catfish was decent, but nothing special.  When you come here, stick with the shellfish.  \n\nI recommend this place.  Be sure to get here early, as it isn't a big place and fills fast, and expect it to be messy and fun!", "type": "review", "business_id": "YrIfgzLj0DPStJ1ESAS_Qg"}

Loved it.  And then after I came back from Iraq I was pleasantly surprised to see Man vs. Food come and eat here!  Good for them (both the show and the restaurant!).  \n\nComing for CES I wanted to come back here.  Came on a Friday night and the place was packed.  Had to wait 30 minutes.  \n\nWhen they sat me down, the menu looked identical to what it was 2 years ago.  They told me because of the new opening of a 2nd Hot 'N Juicy in Washington (D.C. or state?) the shrimp was buy one and get one free.  Sure, why not?  So I ordered 1 lb of crawdad, 1 lb of crab legs and 1 lb of shrimp which turned into 2 lbs of shrimp.  \n\nGot the Hot 'N Juicy flavor which is a combination of all their flavors together.  You get four different flavors to choose from (check the website's menu) or you can just combine them all.  So I did this and asked for extra garlic.  And I emphasized a lot of garlic.  And I chose medium as to how spicy.  I remember the 1st time I went I ordered either the spicey or extra spicey and after 2 lbs of crawdad my mouth and innards were burning.  So I decided on medium this time.\n\nThe tables you sit down at are covered with a plastic sheet.  You get a bib to eat all your food with also.  The food comes out in a plastic bag that holds your food and the juice of whatever flavor you chose.  While eating your food, you crack and open whatever it is you're eating directly on the table.  After you're down, the waiters just come and wrap up the entire thing with that plastic sheet and voila!  A brand new clean table is ready.  I thought this was so cool the 1st time I came here so I made a complete mess of myself and the table.\n\nFood came out and I started to chow down.  There was a ton of garlic in my bags, it was outstanding.  They forgot my bib and half-way through my 1st bag I asked for my bib.  One of the waitresses actually tied it around my neck for me 'cause my hands were already all messy.  I laughed as she tied it for me!  That's service!\n\nFood was even better than I last remembered.  Shrimp was completely on point being moderate to big sized.  Choose snow crab for my legs and they were great.  And of course the crawdad was excellent.  After 4 lbs of food the spices got to me again.  Will have to go with mild sauce next time-sigh, I'm just getting old and can't quite handle my spicy foods like I use to.\n\nSo overall Hot 'N Juicy actually improved since I last came here-amazing.  A definite have to visit if you love crawdad.", "type": "review", "business_id": "YrIfgzLj0DPStJ1ESAS_Qg"}

Cutting a piece of meat with a knife and/or fork/spoon (when I'm even lazier) is probably the most strenuous work I'll tolerate. Using my fork or spoon is enough, isn't it?\n\nThe ONLY, I repeat ONLY, food I'll take time to carefully work at and eat is shellfish...specifically crab, lobster and crawfish. Unfortunately, being located in the Tri State area, there is a lack of crawfish which saddens me. Since I was in town for work I jumped at the opportunity to eat one of my favorite shellfish friends...crawfish!\n\nAfter leaving the CES convention center, my colleagues and I hailed a taxi* and requested to go to Hot N Juicy located in Chinatown. A split second later, we realized Hot N Juicy sounded like a strip club so we joked around with the taxi driver and insisted it wasn't a peep show. We were going to that AFTER we ate.\n\nMy colleagues didn't know it but I was giggling like a little school girl when we arrived. Unfortunately for them, they aren't as adventurous when it comes to food so they ordered calamari, chicken wings and fries which they enjoyed.\n\nOur waiter was extremely informative, briefly describing to us (mostly me) how to order the seafood (per pound), by seasoning and spiciness. Since I've been to Boiling Crab I already knew what I wanted...2 lbs of garlic butter crawfish with medium heat. The garlic butter seasoning is SO mouth wateringly good that I could drink it as a side (not recommended though). They serve the seafood in plastic bags with bibs and paper towels. This is the messiest meal you will ever eat but so worth it. I was in business attire but was able to leave without any stains!\n\nAs I twisted and separated the head and tail, sucked the head and pushed out the meat from the tail...my colleagues looked at me in complete disgust like I was a monster. Did I feel bad? Not at all. I easily finished the 2 lbs of crawfish like a true fatty. I ordered medium heat but my mouth was on fire pretty much the entire time I was eating so to counteract the heat, I took big swigs of beer which helped. \n\nThe seafood pricing on the menu says market price so be sure to ask the waiter beforehand. The crawfish was about $10 per pound. Currently, they're having a BOGO shrimp special because they opened up another Hot N Juicy location in Washington, DC. Do I hear a road trip?\n\nMy next visit will showcase their blue crab legs. If you're ever in Vegas or DC, I would highly recommend coming here if you're a seafood lover and don't mind getting messy. It's a freakin' dream.\n\nA fun tip, Hot N Juicy was on Man vs. Food.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n*In Las Vegas, taxis aren't allowed to pick up passengers on streets like NYC.

The fries were a tad soggy, even though they had poked holes through the container to let the steam escape.

We only lived in Louisiana for 2 1/2 years but that's long enough to know about some good southern food! \nMy husband and I got the same thing; 2 pounds of Crawfish with Spicy Cajun (Louisiana Style, Garlic Butter and Lemon Pepper) flavoring with medium spice level. I myself noticed the spice level in the corn since we had the corn and potato added to the bag's of Crawfish. Medium was even spicier than what we ever had in Louisiana, but the waiter did inform us to go down a level of what we were used to. \nThe Crawfish was pretty good all in all. My husband and I both only had about 5 good sized Crawfish in each of our bags, maybe since it's off season. So that was a disappointment. I wish that they would clean the the Crawfish before they cook them. It's not fun looking at a Crawfish that looks like it still has dirt and sand on it.....ya ya ya I know their called mud-bugs but still. I know that would take some time for them to do but it just looks better. Your going to a Crawfish joint not a Chinese Buffet with Crawfish. \nIt was kinda pricey since we're used to paying a couple bucks a sack in Louisiana, granted here they are the ones taking the time to boil them. During off season with live Crawfish (the waiter said some night's they're frozen) it worked out to be about $10-$11per pound. (On the menu for Crawfish it does say market price, the waiter said during season it might be about $8 per pound) They don't have a kids menu so we had to pay $7.50 for our 3 year old daughter to get a chicken nugget's and fries basket. For all 3 of us we got a total of 4lbs. Crawfish, 2 extra corn's, chicken and fries basket, 1 soda and 2 water's and our bill was $65.00 before tip. We will try to get back before we move out of state this summer but we are also planning on having some shipped in from Louisiana and doing our own Crawfish boil so we'll see.

She recommended the lemon pepper, and I'm glad we followed her advice. We got both shrimp and crawfish, one with the hot 'n' juicy, and one with the lemon pepper. \n\nThe crawfish were incredible. The meat was sweet, with a bit of a floral fragrant aftertaste. I have a friend who swears by crawfish, but I didn't know why until now. We could also de-vein the crawfish just by tugging on the tail of the shell after breaking off the head. I had no idea that was possible, and call me odd but it added an element of fun to the experience. The shells were also thinner than I've previously experienced - I just wanted to crunch into them after carnally tearing off the heads. Talk about bringing out my inner beast.\n\nThey give you salt and pepper for dip, and also some lime/lemon. Tip from my boyfriend: instead of using just a sprinkling, ask for a ton of limes/lemons, and fill one of the little containers with the juice. Then, load it with the salt and pepper. It gives you a flavor option besides the spicy, buttery sauce, and kinda cuts through the grease. That way, you can endlessly rotate between pungent and rich, and citrusy sweet.\n\nThe waitress also wrote \"Thank You\" on our receipt. A great, friendly touch.

Finally I can put an end to all the \"you've got to try Earl's\" and \"you've never been to Earl's?\" and \"dude, Earl's is amazing\" because I ate at Earl's!!!  Is everyone quite satisfied now?\n\nThis Earl's is in the Planet Hollywood Casino which attributes to its popularity and long lines.  I don't think there is anywhere on the strip you could find a more affordable meal unless you are completely desperate and stumble towards a fast food chain like McDonald's or Subway.  Speaking of Subway, Earl's is nothing like Subway or Quiznos for that matter.  I was somewhat expecting Earl's to be like these two popular chains but fortunately, Earl's was a few hundred notches up on the sandwich ladder.  Earl has a extremely efficient ordering and sandwich production line.  I promplty received my order within a couple minutes of payment, mind you, there was quite the crowd so the speed of execution was quite impressive and would make any VP of Operations proud.\n\nWhen a place is so hyped up I'm usually faced with bitter disappointment but I'm happy to say that this time, with Earl's, I wasn't disappointed.  Mind you, it wasn't a life altering experience and harps and giggling angels didn't fill my head after the first bite but overall, it was one of my best sandwich experiences.\n\nBecause of all the hype, I took it upon myself to try as many sandwiches during my visit as possible so I promptly ordered the Original roast beef, the Earl's Club, the Italian and the Jerk Chicken along with a brownie, a Blue Moon Beer and a Coke.  Before you start pondering what a complete pig I am, I shared these with my group of 4 so everyone got a 1/4 sandwich each.  This was a great way to try a wide selection of their sandwiches, a prix fix Earl's sampling if you would.\n\nOn to the actual sandwiches. \n\nThe Original was superb.  The roast beef was juicy and flavorful, the horshradish was spicy and blended perfectly with the beef and sharp cheddar cheese.  It was light years ahead of the roast beef sandwich I had at Quiznos just a few weeks before. The Club was also very delightful with turkey and ham with fresh lettece and tomatoes.  The Italian wasn't my favorite with its Pastrami and ham combination but everyone else in my group thought it was terrific, I guess I'm not a big fan of Pastrami.  For me, the star of the show was the Jerk Chicken.  The chicken was moist and the Jerk sauce added a spicy kick to this exceptional sandwich.  The thing that made all these sandwiches special was the bread.  Only one kind of bread is served at Earl's and its their artisan white perfectly toasted.  If you believe that bread is what makes a great sandwich then Earl's should be your sandwich Mecca because you would be extremely hard pressed to find another worthy opponent.\n\nHmmmm, I seem to have written too much....I doubt any of you will actually read to this point but for those that make it this far, thanks, I'm relieved my rambling was entertaining enough to retain your attention for this long.  I guess I'll just summerize Earl's in one last line.  If you haven't tried Earl Of Sandwich, you should listen to all these 5 star Yelp reviews and take the plunge, you'll most likely become another raver like myself.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

So I went there one day and grabbed a late lunch, and when I took my first bite it was absolutely wonderful. So much better than any sandwich I've had in Canada. \n\nI love their full Montagu sandwich, it was tasty, delicious and of great value. (In Canada are food portions are usually smaller than the U.S, so for me the sandwich was a good size.) The bun is always crispy but not hard so that it rips the roof of your mouth. (not a fan of hard breads) and the way that everything just melds is amazingly simple yet is a melt in your mouth experience that is hard to describe.\n\nDuring my stay in Vegas I ate there 3 times and each sandwich has always made my stomach smile. (I remember one was Hawaiian, but I can't remember the 3rd). The only downfall is that if you are a bit of health nut then you may want to watch out for the sodium levels. I know they are quite high. \n\nBut what most people may not mention is that their salads are absolutely great for the price you pay. Salads are never prepackaged and suffocating in a plastic container. They are made fresh and taste wonderful. The pricing of around 6 bucks for a salad is almost unheard of in Las Vegas. \n\nAt the end if you're looking for a sandwich and salad meal for under $13 US, definitely go to Earl. You can't get better value. \n\nConsidering what the cost of other meals in Vegas are, this is a great place for bachelors and people who are with a family and budget conscious.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

If you're in the hotel, this is a perfectly good no-frills place to grab a sandwich.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

Too bad they only have a few locations throughout the USA but who cares! ITS THE BEST IN THE WORLD! I eat at Earl's at least 3 times every vegas trip!\n\nI Will begin reviewing each sandwich shortly...\n\nCarribean Jerk Chicken Sandwich:\nMy personal favorite on the menu! I love the banana peppers and the right amount of spicyness of this sandwich. I even add Tabasco Sauce to kick it up a little bit! This is a must have if you have never been to Earl before.  MY PERSONAL FAVORITE!\n\nItalian Sandwich:\nItalian sandwiches are great wherever you go but this certainly is one of the best sandwiches on the menu. Make sure you eat it right away while its hot and order the delicious salt n vinegar chips to go along with it!\n\nTuna Sandwich:\nOne of the simplest sandwiches on the menu with it having only 2 ingredients on the inside, Albacore tuna and swiss cheese.  The bread is of course what makes this sandwich but every sandwich is served hot and this hot tuna sandwich was SUPERB!\n\nThe Original:\nIf you're into Horse Raddish and Roast Beef this is awesome! I also love the earl's spicy mustard they put to add some kick to it!\n\nEarl's frozen Lemonade: \nEXCELLENT! Just like the frozen lemonade you buy at disneyland. Cheap too!\n\nCaprese Sandwich:\nIf you've ever been to italy or just had mozarella and tomato Caprese or just enjoy something without meat, this sandwich does the trick. Too bad they dont make this smaller, because it would be a great appetizer.\n\nKono Coffee:\nNot bad, I prefer walking to Coffee Bean inside miracle mile!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

So here's the deal.\n\nYou go to a few different sandwich shops on different days to pick up some goods to indulge your nom nom feeling. Say you like the BLT or the Club and that's what you get every time, regardless.  You choose these because you focus on the what's being sandwiched between the two pieces of bread.  The bread is seriously just some edible cushion to keep your hands from getting messy from eating the goodness of what's inside the sandwich.  It's the law of sandwich bread.\n\nYou come in Earl of Sandwich and that law is completely broken. You can get ANY sandwich, and despite which one you get, it WILL be a winner.  The highlight of each sandwich IS the bread. It's perfectly toasted on the outside and warm and fluffy in the inside. It truly disgusts me to even think about how beautiful sandwich bread could be. A dinky picture and even this review can barely describe the wonders of their bread. You're probably thinking, \"Damn, this girl is seriously trippin' about the bread\", and you know what? Yeah, I am. It's seriously that good. Okay, thats enough on bread.\n\nThe Full Montagu is very delicious and the roast beef was tender.\n\nThe Club tasted so fresh and the bacon gave it a nice crunch.\n\nThe Carribean Jerk is a must have if you want loads of flavor in your sandwich.\n\nI've also tried some of their wonderfully made soups:\n\nTomato Soup- was thick, creamy, and had croutons in it. My boyfriend ordered the food while I was away in one of the stores, and the soup was sitting for awhile. I came back, all sad faced, because the croutons were going to be soggy.... or atleast that's what I thought. It was 100% crunchy and the soup was at a perfect hot temperature. If you like tomato soup, it's a MUST have.\n\nBroccoli Cheese Soup- was also very creamy and flavorful. It was thick and chunky, but not too thick where it had the consistency of porridge ( a red flag for me to send it away ). \n\nExpect to stand in a line during hungry hours; You get a pager when your food is ready. Trust me, its worth the wait! The sandwiches are your ordinary sandwich prices and soups are also well priced. I honestly believe it tastes like a million bucks though.... nothing compares to these sandwiches.\n\nOne of the best parts is, is that my hotel was a 3 minute walking distance from Planet Hollywood ( @ the Marriot ) and I literally could walk here ANY part of the day/night ( 24-hour service!!!! ) to grab a nomster sandwich.\n\nI'm seriously coming here EVERY time I visit Vegas!\n\nPS--\nBeware of staring at random people in that area, you may get punched to the face and knocked down to the ground. My friend did, atleast. HAHAHAHAHHA. Sucks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

There was only one thing left to do which was to see what the hype was all about myself. \n\nThe place is located inside the Planet Hollywood across from the sports book. It's open 24/7 for all you lovely belligerent and drunk, 5 inch heels in hand meaning blackened Hobbit feet, crusted yack on chin folks. The Earl just might be your savior.\n\nFor a measly $5-6, you can get a nice, freshly made and toasted sandwich. There are many options to choose from such as the classic club to the Hawaiian bbq. Of course there are other items on the menu like their rich tomato soup (I recommend the croutons on the side), salads, wraps, and so forth. \n\nThe word about the Earl of Sandwich is out so don't go bezerk if you see a pessimistic long line. Their efficient staff will keep the lines steadily moving and it shouldn't take too long for the orders to be called. The only downfall is possibly the seating for it may fill up quickly.\n\nOn our most recent trip to Sin City, we stopped by Earl's twice due to the fact that we stayed at PH and so it was always a short walk away. On a random note, I would like to state that for some odd reason I enjoyed the sandwiches from Earl the next morning after it was left out over night more than straight out of the oven. Perhaps it was the hangover munchies?\n\nGive the Earl a hollar if you're ever in the (702) area code.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

Earl of Sandwich...the person still remains nameless, but nevertheless, this mysterious person is still the earl...of sandwich.\n\nUPDATE:\nMy friend just told me that there actually was an Earl of Sandwhich, Edward Montagu, of Sandwhich, Kent, England and I sorta, kinda, maybe, slightly feel stupid, but whatevers. Earl of Sandwhich still rocks!", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

I also highly recommend buying a bag of their BBQ chips, which was satisfyingly crunchy and savory.\n\nLove, love, love Earl of Sandwich.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

Although I had never heard of this place before, it was clear that I had to try it, and I am definitely glad that I did.\n\nThe first thing that stands out about Earl of Sandwich is the price.  When you are used to paying $8-10 for a sandwich in DC, $6 for a sandwich is fantastic.  And when that $6 sandwich tastes better than any that you're used to, it's mind-blowing to say the least.\n\nI tried The Original 1762, a roast beef sandwich with cheddar cheese and horseradish sauce.  I also had a taste of The Full Montagu, which has roast beef, turkey, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard.  First off, the bread is outstanding.  It's toasted and has a great crunch to it, without being overly thick.  The meats are also great and the sandwiches have a good amount on them.  Although the sandwiches are a bit on the small side, they are ok for a smaller meal, especially when paired with chips or soup (which I did not personally try, but have heard good things about).\n\nOverall it's a great place to go and I highly recommend it.  That sandwich was one of the best I've ever had and I wish I had had time to try more of their menu.

My friend kept on telling me that this place had good sandwiches, and she was right! I first tried this place around 12:30am - 1am, so it's good if you have a late night craving.\n\nThe first sandwich that I had was the Caribbean jerk chicken. This was my first experience with jerk chicken, and it was full of flavor. The bread was also nice and toast as well. The second time I went I tried the Earl club. Out of the two sandwiches that I tried I would say that the Earl club was better, because of there were more ingredient to add to the flavor. Both sandwiches however were equally good, and I would order them again.\n\nWhat's really nice about this place is that they take your order really fast, and they make your sandwiches fast as well. There's also the added perks of being open late when you want a late night snack or something. In addition, all the sandwiches are 5.99, which is pretty good considering that things are usually more expensive in Vegas, especially on the strip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

It usually doesn't get much safer than \"the Original,\" but I was so disappointed. No, I was devastated at how much of a letdown this sandwich was. The bread is good, but it was the best part about the sandwich. The fuckin BREAD. I could tell that Earl was going with a completely different concept with his sandwich than Ike (@ Lime). Whereas Ike mindfucks you with an avalanche of ingredients and flavors, Earl keeps his sandwiches as simple as possible. My Original had bread, meat, and sauce. That's it. I wanted so badly to appreciate the simplistic beauty of it, but I couldn't. It's just too boring.\n\nI had a bite of the Full Montagu, I was not impressed. I had a bite of the Italian.

This place is really popular on the weekends and wait can get up to 2+ hours. So it might be a good time to get a player's card at M resort. If you collect enough points you can get VIP passes to the front of the line. \n\nOn a side note M resort is also a really good place to stay.

I'll tell you why:  I can eat my worth & wait (you read that correctly, not weight; and it's like $33 and a 40 minute wait for brunch or dinner) there.  Why?  So many reasons, but the main one is the snow crab legs.  You can get 'em on ice or steamed, and I go for the latter.  I've never waited in line for them and they never run out which is amazing since God knows people like me are stuffing ourselves like gluttons with them.  \n\nLet me attempt to describe the dessert bar.  I didn't actually measure the length of this section of delectable, heaven-on-earth, but I'd estimate it's at least 30 yards in length and it caters to sugar-free dessert eaters as well as the rest of us more irresponsible feeders.  They offer every conceivable kind of pie (I didn't check for rhubbard) and cake you can fathom, plus danishes, cream puffs of multiple flavors, creme brule, cakes so beautiful you *almost* feel guilty to dismantle and eat, truffles and at least 10 flavors of gellato.  Maybe you're more of a after-dinner drinks kind of person.  That's fine, too.  They have a full alcohol bar plus an espresso machine so if you'd like a Bailey's Irish Cream hot coffee, just say so (and show your ID).  \n\nWhat's your palette prefer?--Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Italian, American, others?  Don't worry; the M's got your tongue.  I'm a dangerous kind of buffet diner in that my eyes are often bigger than my stomach and so I have to really try not to waste food.  If you suffer from this same kind of temptation, try to pace yourself and do small portions each trip.  There's so much and it's so beautifully, invitingly laid out that you'll want to try it all.   \n\nThe environment is busy, but I never feel rushed to get out.  I mean, for crying out loud, I stood in line almost an hour to get seated so I'm going to take my time.  It's not like they're going to run out of food and if they run out of something, you're probably not going to notice since there's so many choices (unless it's the crab legs, and I've yet to experience that).  There's a loudness to the place, but it's not overwhelming, and that's probably partially because of the wide openness of the eating area.  It's well lit, not too crowded for such a popular establishment, and has a chic decor, but the thing you will never forget is the food--options, presentation, and taste.  It's been about a year since I last ate there and I can't forget the food, but the decor is blurry in my recollection.  \n\nForget what the Travel Channel says about the Strip's buffets; they still will pale in comparison to what The M has to offer.

If you have a ride and some time, I would recommend the short drive. On weekends they offer some seafood options in their buffet. Apparently on this particular weekend that we went, there was a special deal for lunch time: $16 per person (regular price is about $30ish). Score!\n\nDon't be fooled by thinking that just because the M Resort is located away from all the strip action that people aren't going to flock to this buffet. I highly advise you to come early or at least be ready to wait. Don't say you weren't warned. We got there around 1 pm and had to wait about a full hour before we got seated.

There's everything from some sushi, to random Asian selections, to Mediterranean, as well as steam crab legs and boiled shrimp. They of course have prime rib as well as tri tip and ribs available.

They purposely keep it concealed for a reason.\n\nWe all literally rolled out of Studio B quite impressed, retardedly full, and ready to blow some gaskets.

When it came to this review however, I had a long, intense internal debate.  In the scheme of food I have eaten in my life, this buffet certainly is not going to come in win, place or show.  That being said, I felt it only fair to compare it to other buffets and thus my five star ranking.  In many ways if your looking for the best buffet in Vegas when factors like price, setting and options are considered, I might suggest this is #1 in Vegas.\n\nI have eaten at Studio B multiple times at all times of the day and have found the food consistent. delicious and with care put into the preparation and presentation.  On weekends, the bounty of seafood that is provided is top notch.  It includes Crab legs (both warm and cold), shrimp and a number of fish options like baked salmon and mahi-mahi.  There are also sushi rolls if you should choose to weigh down your gut with rice.  \n\nMeats are rep'd as well and the carving station boasts tri-tip, prime rib, chicken & turkey.  Salad, fruit and other vegetarian options looked and tasted appealing for a carnivore like me....no small feat.  \n\nWhile not a huge desert guy, the pastries and gelato here are fantastic.  Yes you heard me right....gelato!  And not just two flavors either but a full assortment ranging from pistachio to coffee.\n\nAnd then it brings me to my favorite part of the experience............free booze!!!!  For the price of all buffets, draught beer and wine is included.  I know, I know its not fancy beer (Coors Light) or wine but you can drink as much of it as you like.  And believe me when I say after your third glass of beer it really doesn't matter what type of beer is being consumed.\n\nFinally, one of the true underrated features of Studio B buffet is the setting.  Arranged in a circular room with the food beginning on the edges and working its way all the way into the middle, this buffet space feels inviting and fun.  Also at the very back is a large panoramic window that overlooks the entire Las Vegas Valley giving great views and a healthy dose of natural light...a rarity in the world of incandescent casinos.\n\nOverall Studio B buffet might not knock your socks off but simply by virtue of deciding to patronize a buffet, its clear that culinary excellence is not the most important thing.  In that vein, Studio B is your best choice...much like the 2008 presidential election.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

Buffets are an integral part of any Las Vegas trip, and after eating at the M Resort Buffet, I have found a new favorite.  This was actually the last meal my cohort and I had before leaving for home on a Sunday afternoon - and I gotta say, it was a blissful way to end the trip.\n\nI know this review won't do the place any justice, since there's tons of food that I did not even get to try.  But here's my attempt:\n\nI must mention that on this particular lunch excursion, the M was offering the seafood lunch, which is apparently different from the usual lunch menu.  Just something to keep in mind.  \n\nOXTAIL soup:  this is one of my favorite dishes of the afternoon.  Tender, tender pieces of oxtail in savory broth.  I wanted to get huge bowlfuls, but I restrained myself so I could have room for more food.  I am still craving that flavor 30 hours later.  I am seriously going to try making this dish at home, in hopes that it will be on par with the M.\n\nBeef Panaang: yummy with rice.  I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nPoke salad: I love poke, and I love trying different restaurants' versions of it.  This was pretty good, although not the best I've had, but commendable.  \n\nOssobuco: This is the first time I've tried this dish.  It made me happy.  \n\nChicken Florentine: wonderful, creamy flavor - and moist chicken.  \n\nCandied Yams:  Another one of my favorite dishes!  I usually skip over this dish at most buffets - but, well done, M, well done.\n\nCrabs:  There must have been at least three different type of crab legs.  Some served on ice, warm snowcrab legs, and chinese style ginger crab.  All very good.\n\nRaw Oysters: I just love it when a buffet serves raw oysters.  I go to town!\n\nThere's definitely much, much more in the entree section, but you'll have to check it out for yourself.  Now onto DESSERTS!\n\nI usually don't care for desserts much at a buffet.  But it's a whole other story here.  CREME BRULEE!  Wow!  It's just perfectly done.  A nice crispy, caramelized sugar top, and flecks of vanilla bean throughout the body of the creme!  YUM YUM YUM!  \n\nThey also have a wonderful cheesecake, a pretty wide selection of gelato, and even espresso drinks made to order.  All the desserts were presented beautifully as well.  I've converted to a buffet dessert lover because of this place :)\n\nAnd for all your alcohol-loving yelpers, beer and wine included!!!

Other than that, the crab and seafood, korean kalbi, pastas and meat were all very good!\n\nFYI, dessert bar: Order the Cappuccino with a shot of Bailey's!

The chicken (fried and roasted were dry and coarse and the assorted sushis were cold and hard from over refrigeration. Was probably was made in NY city? The carved prime rib was what probably saved the evening but never again on an ordinary weekday night. I'm guessing that most of the posters had the Friday night seafood special which apparently cost a lot more than the $23 we were charged. Sorry to report on such a dismal experience.

Sometimes I have a hard time making it past the salads, there are so many to choose from and so very different than your usual fair at other buffets, I crave the tabouli salad! \n\nI love a big plate of steamed crab legs, and I usually start off with such, I love cracking the shells, pulling them apart one section at a time, dipping the meat in the clarified butter. Once I'm satisfied with this plate, I can move on to the many other stations, all just as satisfying. \n\nOne more must have is the deserts, take a big plate and don't be shy, load it up! The creme brulee is terrific, the warm brownie cup is melt in your mouth good, and the little cups of flavor, like the pistachio raspberry mouse is wonderful. \n\nIf you enjoy eating, love to try good food, you must stop by the M and try Studio B, believe me, you won't be disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

Went during lunch (around 2pm on a Sat) and it was great. Most of the food was really good and tasty. The crab legs and other seafood were amazing. The usual buffet sushi section was good, nothing too spectacular. I'll usually make it sashimi style. Still really enjoyed it.\n\nMany other offerings were great. Loved the buckwheat noodles, ox tail stew, and more. Condiments were well organized. Meat section was good to, we missed the prime rib, but roast beef was still good. Mahi Mahi grilled on the bamboo stalk was ok for me, but my friends liked it. I felt it was a bit overcooked. \n\nThere's a nice beer and wine bar as well and big dessert offerings w/ gelato! Creme brulee and the dessert shots were oh so good.\n\nOne of my new favorite buffets in LV. Clean, well lit, the staff is friendly and attentive. They clear plates out faster than the $1 slot machines taking your money. This is well worth the wait in line.\n\n*Tip: Get a free M players card and lunch price is 2 for 1 (before 2:30pm). Not sure if it's everyday, but make sure to check that out. We saved some money! :)\n\nRandom: Joe Jackson (Michael Jackson's father) and a couple of his buddies sat at the table next to ours.

It's easy to see why Studio B won the award for \"Best New Buffet\" in Vegas for 2010.  It's also the only \"all you can drink\" buffet in terms of wine and beer. In terms of sheer selection, Studio B has got the Bellagio and Wynn buffets beat.  The dessert bar is pure decadence, with just about every kind of beautifully decorated, delectable dessert you can imagine.  Other highlights: crab legs and prime rib (a staple).  Surprisingly, I was also a big fan of their sweet potato with marshmallows.  Areas for improvement: the oysters did not look fresh (at all), and I wasn't a huge fan of their osso bucco (though it's a dish I normally love).  Additionally, they don't have as many of the \"exotic\" meat selections as the Bellagio dinner buffet.  For the price, though, Studio B really can't be beat.  If you have access to a car or don't mind venturing farther south of the strip to the M Resort, this should be one of your top Vegas buffet picks.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

I'm not big on buffets and neither is my girl but we had heard so much that we had to try it out on our way out of Vegas. \n\nThe resort seemed nice enough. This review is just for the food. \n\nFirst thing first....All you can drink wine and beer. So the wine wasn't the best quality but it was nice and chilled and a major bonus since I wasn't expecting it. The buffet boasted over 200 items to choose from. It was presented very nicely and the overall feel of the place felt very open and spacious. Everything we tried was flavorful and piping hot. Which was a bit of a pleasant surprise. Since it was close to Chinese New Years they had a very large Asian selection. The korean ribs were amazing as well as the orange chicken. I love ginger and they had fresh chopped ginger as a garnish. Who does that? Kudos for all the fresh condiments.\n\nWe are not much into seafood but saw that everyone else was. Plates and plates of crab legs, oysters and mahi mahi. There was shrimp cooked in multiple ways and all kinds of sauces to dip into. \n\nAsian, Italian, American and everything in between there was something for everyone. And the dessert spread was amazingly good. They have over 25 flavors of gelatto and you can also have a latte or mocha made fresh! They had some pistachio raspberry concoction that was just way too good to pass up.  \n\nThe only  negative was the wait..... but it is well worth it. We waited for about 45 minutes and there was only 4 couples ahead of us. So patience is key.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

But there are some things that I wasn't liking.  \n\nLocated inside the newly built M Resort, Studio B Buffet has a very nice structure for their entrance way.  It seems like that they took the time to figure out the set up and how its going to look, once people stands in line.  Even though, it was kind of busy when we got there, at least they got something for us to read, or to look at.  Mainly something to keep us entertained while waiting in line to get a table.  The line was moving quickly, since they had two cashiers to check you in.  Quickly after, they had some one escort us to our table.\n\nThe setting was very nice, it look like a big \"C\".  It is very spacious and roomy.  Enough space to move around, and not hit other tables.  But, the buffet line itself, I didn't like the fact that its all on one line.  I like buffet, where you can move around the island and pick something else, when your waiting for another item to be open.  But the fact of people jumping in front of you and you don't want to jump in front of others, seems a bit awkward in a way.  \n\nThe selection of the food, is AMAZING.  They have something that I'm sure everyone would love.  Especially a buffet with Sushi, I would eat that all day if  could.  But, going there at a point where its really busy, the food tend to be slim pickings when your up there.  Since everyone is jumping to get what they want, by the time you get to a certain food, some one already grabbed it before you did.  So the cooks were kind of slow to bring out the food.  On the other hand, it was kind of expected, since it was during busy hours.  \n\nThe staff, I believe, was absolutely awesome.  From the point of checking with the cashier, to being escorted to our tables, to the waitress who made sure our glass was never empty.  It was very warming that these staff will still smile and say thank you, despite how busy it was.  \n\nI would recommend this Buffet, if you don't mind people jumping in front of you to pick at food.  But the taste overall was great, the selection was awesome, and the staff was very friendly.  Overall, I would highly recommend this Buffet Style.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

I've never had better dessert at any of the other buffets.  The gelatto was good, but I found the miniature desserts much better:  creme brulee, pistaccio creme thing in a shotglass, tiramisu.

This happened THREE times in the past 5 days I was trying to grab a meal there.\n\nHere's where it became a sh*tshow. The M resort offers a lot of complimentary deals now to gamblers now. Why you ask? To make their gamblers stay at the hotel longer, therefore raking in more revenue. Smart ass business plan they got there, they even have the weekdays covered with special deals such as \"Senior Wednesdays\" (a horror fest with all 60+ seniors filling the entire casino to the brim with walkers and wheel chairs). The M resort definitely cares more about making their gamblers stay; they hand out comped meals like candy therefore making the VIP line EXTREMELY long on top of the EXTREMELY long waiting lines thus translating to absolutely absurd waiting times.\n\nAnother point observed in my 5+ visits there (which all ended up driving back on the strip since it was packed to the brim), apparently they also offer meal passes (all day any day) to locals, so forget about going on weekends when the entire city of LV is trying to grab a good deal.\n\nThe M resort has made their star buffet too accessible to the masses. Just a warning to people who don't want to wait 3+ hours for a 20 dollar buffet. Are you seriously going to waste hours of your time just to save a few dollars on a buffet? Spend the extra 10 and go on to Bellagio and the Wynn, their lines move way faster now (waited 30 or less minutes for both of them on a WEEKEND during dinner rush).  \n\nOr wait a few years until the old folks that flood the lines to croak from too much crab legs and beef fat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

Or is it just me?  \n\nAnyway, my favorite buffet for years has been the Bellagio Buffet.  Probably what made it the best was the awesome selection and the king crab legs that they served.  The last time I went there though, they didn't have king crab legs so then I really had no real strong desire to HAVE to go back there.  I mean, let's be honest.  A buffet is a buffet is a buffet.  Right?  WRONG!\n\nStudio B in the M Resort has ousted the title of best buffet in Vegas, in my book.  *erasing Bellagio and writing in Studio B*  First of all, the selection.  Once you enter the dining area after the line for the ends after over an hour long wait, you'll see that it looks like a maze.  But I thought to myself, \"Ah, it's probably another one of those buffets that have duplicate dishes on either side, to make the line more efficient, right?  WRONG!\n\nEvery single plate, nook, cranny of that line has a different dish.  I think what I like best about this buffet is that there's a lot of Asian themed dishes here, reminiscent of dishes that you can find in Hawaii.  Yes, I'm Asian.  (You just looked at my profile picture again just to make sure I wasn't lying, didn't you?) And yes, I'm from Hawaii.  So when there's something on the buffet line in a resort NOT located in The California Hotel or in the Main Street Station Hotel and Casino, it's actually pretty impressive.  Kal bi?  Teriyaki steak?  Wow.  If I lived in Vegas, this would definitely be a place that I would come to so I could get  my local food fix.  They also have crab legs!  OK, so it's not king crab legs.  But it was still delicious!  \n\nSo what's the worst part of a buffet?  Having to pay for drinks when you already paid a lot for the food, right?  WRONG!  They even give you unlimited wine and beer here!  When I went, I didn't have any since I don't like to drink when I'm trying to binge eat and pretend I'm not going to eat again for a week.  But next time I go, I'm definitely going to get some alcohol to consume with my meal.\n\nWhat's the second worst part of a buffet?  Poor service, right?  WRONG!  The service here was great.  Our server ensured our iced teas were always refilled and we had all the napkins or whatever else we needed at hand.  \n\nIf you come to Vegas, make sure you come here.  And try to come on a weekend so you get the FULL (seafood) buffet.  Don't walk...RUN!  It'll bump you up ahead of at least a few people in line, guaranteed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

The line moved at a decent clip for having only two cashiers available and once we were inside we were quickly seated. The first round proved to me two things;\n\n1) Lots of salads were available, which was kind of nice as it showed an appreciation of fresh vegetables and salads that is often skipped at buffets\n2) Lots of carby, simply options as de rigeur at most buffets (mashed potatoes, breads, rice, pastas, etc)\n\nI loaded up with a slice of galbi (overly sweet and tasted of sugar, though it had a pleasant charcoal-like flavor), several cold shrimp, a slice of salmon nigiri (shrivelled and dry salmon, skipped the rice), several oyster (mostly mushy and full of ice chunks) and a spring roll (crisp but pretty average)  and a bowl of clam chowder (good, with lots of chunks of seafood but not comparable to the clam chowder at an oyster bar in florida...).  My boyfriend and our friend grabbed a piece of rib eye, then saw that there were much better rare slices out and went for those instead. The first slices they grabbed were over cooked and dry, probably having sat under the heat lamp for too long. The fresher slices had more flavor and were finished quickly. We also tried some of their crab legs, which were tasty but were skinny with little meat.\n\nThey added fresh oysters to the buffet and those were a bit better, though I had to wait for them to thaw out before I could eat them.\n\nThe dessert area was pretty nice; they have a wide selection of gelato flavors available as well as many mini desserts, cannolis (tasty) ,  creme brulees (delicious!), fruit tarts (good), cappuccinos (nice, and they come with a free shot of flavoring) and many other goodies. Definitely one of the highlights of the buffet!\n\nThe selection changes each night and the customer service is decent given how busy they are. We accidentally spilled a water and it was never replaced, nor did we ever receive additional napkins. Just minor things, but when you're sampling several different types of dishes it's nice to be able to clean your hands or palate.. \n\nI'd be willing to go back and see if it's worth a higher rating eventually, but it's a bit expensive for a buffet. If I'm going to go out for a seafood buffet I'll probably go to an AYCE sushi place first.\n\nIt's a pretty good selection and it's another option for a seafood buffet", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

Let's just talk about the buffet.  Overall the food is fair.  For $29.99 you can enjoy a 'seafood buffet' which means you get the leftovers from everything not eaten by yesterday's crowds with some additional crab legs, mahi-mahi and shrimp.  The crab legs are a little too fishy tasting as they sit in heaps next to a vat of melted butter which has particles of various foods floating in it.  Typically, people at buffets get in line for the crab legs, well, not at this place and now I know why.  Their crab is disgusting.  Some of the other buffet mentionables include marginal prime rib and tri-tip beef.  The desserts I would say are above average, particularly the coconut macaroons and cr\u00e8me brule.  How this buffet got dubbed 'Best Buffet' in LV by Best of Las Vegas is a joke and somebody is definitely on the take.  \nHowever, the average food gets overlooked by the poor service across the board.  From top to bottom, the cashiers, maitre de, servers, etc are all less than helpful.  After 45 minutes in line to enter the buffet, there was a guy in front of my party who brought a wedding party of 60 (all of whom were gambling, shopping or whatever rather than waiting in the line) to the front of the line as he approached the cashiers.  No they didn't have a reservation.  No they didn't pay together.  They each paid separately and this was a total inconvenience to the 150+ people who actually waited in line and it created about a 20 minute standstill log jam and the line didn't move while servers scrambled to create a table to fit a party of 60.  I think the M could have prevented this by having a line usher to police the line.  When I expressed my opinion of that its poor policy to have 1 person wait in line for a party of 60, without a reservation, without paying altogether, the Maitre De, just didn't seem interested to listen at all.  Utter shame.  \nI thought I was going to a highly touted local casino with a touch of classy.  Well, I was mistaken.  For those of you looking to go to a classy locals casino, hit up the Green Valley Ranch Resorts.  Better atmosphere, gaming, food and they know how to treat people.   \nI will never step foot in the M resort ever again and neither will my friends or family.

Salads, ehh...not much of a salad person, but hey they had your typical salads, pasta salads, fruit salads, etc.  Pastries were awesome, as well as your regular kids foods like pizza, fries, chicken wings, etc.  I still get those!  The best part is....all you can DRINK beer and wine.  Yup, that's right!  Beer and wine is included in the price.  The desserts were really good too.  Everything I tried was just really good.  The gelato was pretty awesome too.  I thought I saw red velvet gelato and I almost cried tears of joy, but it turned out to be strawberry...I cried a little in the inside though...haha.  All in all, food galore!\n\nThis place exceeded my highest expectations.  I was a bit skeptical thinking that no buffet was worth $30, when I could just go to other buffets that are like $15.  I was definitely proven wrong.  I paid $30 for a buffet that was worth every single cent.  This is a place that I'm definitely going to go to everytime I'm in Vegas.  So check it out for yourself.  It's not that far of a drive from the strip.  It's a beautiful, classy hotel with some bomb food.  Last bit of advice, go there hungry, and I mean like Calista Flockhart type hungry cause you'll definitely want your money's worth.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

She actually bought the the mix to make it at home. Then there was the Forbidden Broadway Sundae. This sundae was huge! A gigantic mountain of rich chocolate cake topped off with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and hot fudge! YUM! ..the 4 of us couldn't take down the sundae. There's too much and it's soooo sweet! I think I downed 2 big glasses of water after eating this. \n\nOverall I think this place is alright, just overpriced. The frozen hot chocolate was $11 and the sundae was $14...yikes!..

A little steep at $14 (for a \"large,\" $11 for a \"single\").  My mochaccino was quite yummy.  My brother's Tiffany espresso was tiny, with sprinkles.  Interesting and cute, but an extra $1 for a few sprinkles?  I dunno...  The onion rings came in this impressive stack, about 8 total.  Nice and thick.  The salty was welcome after so much sweet.\n\nThe waiter also suggested the nachos, sliders, and hot dogs.  We didn't get them, but we did see neighboring tables with them.  Had we not had dinner plans in a few hours, we might have tried them too.\n\nAll in all, an OK experience.

No worries, I made due with what was on the menu and got the donut later on in the week.\n\nOkay, moving on from my story to the review of this restaurant. We came in around 11ish on a Tuesday morning to grab some lunch. We were greeted and seated and looking through the menu. I already knew I was going to get a frozen hot chocolate and I decided to try their ABC burger. This was the avocado, brie and caramelized onion burger...(Can you say YUMMMM!!!). I was a huge burger and I had to break the burger up because it was so huge! I was in love with the bun! It was a one of a kind bun with a very soft texture and sweet taste. I never really thought of ever putting brie on my burger but I guess I will now!!! \n\nThe serve was a hit. Our waitress made sure we were taking care of, was uberly nice and made recommendation. I enjoyed having her as my waitress. \n\nYou would think that from the sound of my review they should be receiving 5 stars but what knocked it down was my donut! So I was happy on tuesday but when I came back friday to get a donut (I am not asking for much....just a big giant donut!) I was welcome by an unfriendlier staff members that didn't really seem to want to help me until I was finally helped by the bartender. Everyone kept telling me to go outside the to go bar to get it but...it was 11:10 and they were still not opened....not cool! Luckily the bartender grab me the donut form the back.  \n\nOverall, depending on the day, the service can be either a hit or a miss. The food was pretty good for me to return. If you're a chocolate lover...go try the frozen hot chocolate!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

It was probably enough food to feed a starving family.\n\nThe crab and artichoke dip was done quite well with large pieces of crab meat.  The dish was well-plated and came looking like a million bucks.\n\nInfamous frrrozen hot chocolate -- delicious and just as good as I remembered from vising the NY store a few years back.\n\nPizza - served on a wooden paddle, it looked ginormous when it arrived.  They did a poor job slicing the pizza into manageable pieces.  \n\nPrice:\nThings seem a bit overprice when you view them on the menu.  $15 for an omelet? However, when you see the portions arrive you soon realize you are actually getting your money's worth.\n\nOverall:\nI really enjoyed my time here.

We decided on a more of a dessert kind of feel dinner, and so we decided on a place called Serendipity 3. Located right off the strip in front of Caesars, it definitely wasn't an easy restaurant to access. As soon as we were seated our waiter just dropped off menus without saying one word and let us be. After what seemed like an eternity, the waiter finally came back and asked us if we were ready to order. I then immediately asked if I can get the restaurant week menu. The waiter then replied saying that there were no specials that he was aware of. I literally busted out my phone and showed him that Serendipity 3 was a part of restaurant week and showed him the specials. He then left and asked one of his fellow colleagues that acknowledged that they did have a restaurant week menu. So the waiter comes by and finally acknowledges that there was a special menu, without any sort of an apology. He took our order and then left. I'm a very patient person when it comes to bad service. What I mean is I have taken a lot of crap without complaining, but this guy was just the worst. First of all he was very soft spoken, and had a very bad attitude problem. What's the first rule of working in the service industry? Leave your problems at the door, and put a smile on your face. This guy definitely needed a lesson in service. Anyways, after all the rude remarks and attitude he gave us while ordering, our food finally came out. Before our food even came out, I noticed the waiter just went around and asked everyone else how they were doing, and completely ignored us. I was without a drink for 15 plus minutes, and did I mention the food came out very slow. I can tell it wasn't the cooks fault, it was our waiter. My chicken dish I've ordered was cold to the core; not even a little feel of warmth. I just let it slide and finished my dinner. The most anticipated part of the meal finally came out, dessert. I've noticed that he has gotten our order wrong, and then informed him of his mistake. Once again without any apology he just takes the plate without a word. I can see his facial expression of disgust as he walked away. The nerves of this guy were incredible! To make the story short, we enjoyed our dessert very much.  Needless to say our waiter never came back after correcting his mistake. My friends and I sat there socializing for a long period of time.  All I can hear is the slurps from the straw, since the drinks were empty. Honestly I just wanted the check so we can leave, but our waiter was nowhere to be found.  When I finally saw our waiter, I politely tried to gain his attention. He totally just ignored me and walked on by. Finally I went up to the front and asked if I could get my check, and the hostess instructed us to ask our waiter. At this point I was furious and asked for a manager. The manager was very nice and offered us a complimentary lunch on them. One thing I believe the manager made a mistake was when he said, \"Yeah, we get complaints on him all the time.\" When I heard that, in my head I was like, \"Then why is he still working here!?\" Thanks to that rude waiter, I will never go back to Serendipity again. I even have a complimentary meal, but no thanks!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

I love all types of sweets but my boyfriend and I both agreed the frozen hot chocolate was definitely nothing special. While we enjoyed most of the food, we were sooo disappointed by the service. About two minutes into receiving our appetizer, the waiter brought out our sandwiches (this is something that realllly annoys me). Then, we went through the entire meal without our waiter checking on us once, which meant no drink refills when we needed it. After about a half hour, our waiter finally came over to refill our drinks which we then waited about another 15 minutes for him to do so. We also noticed that his other tables were not being waited on as well..(Not to mention, the place was not busy by any means) Once our dessert came, our waiter asked us how we liked the frozen hot chocolate... twice... within a couple minutes of each other. We both came to the conclusion that he seemed to be a little drunk!  Overall, the food has good flavor and comes in very generous portions for the price you're paying.

Since there was an available seat at the bar, I decided to stay and eat there.  \n\nUnfortunately the line of to-go orders was right next to my seat and it's hard to enjoy your meal when loads of hungry and cranky hot chocolate seekers are hovering over your food.

The fries were good, but not great. \n\nFrrrozen Hot Chocolate: $10 Their signature drink was good, but not as good as I imagined.  I actually liked the mixed drink better. I do think I might like to try sharing the $15 (for two) size. \n\nSERVICE: \nService was great, the bartender was nice and attentive. \n\nOVERALL: \nI think Serendipity should stick to the desserts and make them easier to get at.

Score! Actually, it wasn't that hard to do, all I had to do was mention frozen hot chocolate.\n\nIt was January 1st and we needed a hangover cure. We were told that the wait was 45 minutes, but since it was freezing and we noticed everyone's great-looking food, we stayed. Other than the hostesses barking at people to get out of the doorway (there was a huge crowd, no waiting area, and nowhere for people to really stand), the wait didn't take long at all, and we were seated after about 20 minutes. \n\nThe cute decor made you feel like you were in a pretty, trendy NYC cafe. I've never visited the NYC location, but Las Vegas' all-out glamorous decor seemed like a good answer to it. Feeling particularly like lard asses, we ordered the mac and cheese, chili cheese dog, and one of the sandwiches with turkey, brie, and apple slices. And 2 frozen hot chocolates to share, of course. Our waiter was cool, upbeat, and even switched tables for us when he heard us joking that it wasn't level. \n\nI've met very few mac and cheeses I didn't like, but this one was off the charts. It came in a deep dish with a rich sauce and prosciutto chunks. So perfect for a cold, hungover day. My friend's chili cheese dog was ridiculously long and she only got about halfway through, and our other friends' open-faced sandwich was great as well. The hot chocolate was decadently delicious, but not $10 so.\n\nI liked this place for the huge menu of both healthy and comfort food, the cocktail list, great waitstaff and cute decor. I disliked the hostesses who thought they were the ish for working at such a \"cool\" place, the expensive prices, and the way that the bathrooms were outside the restaurant. Our food was great, but the prices still seemed overinflated and as if we were paying for the image and novelty.

Lucky for us not long after, a couple were leaving so my friend and i hopped on it like flies to poop!\n\nI ordered the Frrrrozen hot chocolate ($10) while my friend ordered the Frrrozen oreo hot chocolate ($14).

It consisted of cocoa, milk, ice, and i believe sugar was mixed in there also. It gets nicely blended and topped with a ginormous amount of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. My friend's frozen oreo hot chocolate was topped with pieces of oreos and a piece of chocolate egg roll on each side. I guess that's what an extra $4 gets you. \n\nAs soon as i took a sip, I literally jizzed in my pants. Ok, not really. But it was damn good! It was not too sweet - just the perfect amount of sweetness, just perfect. I took a sip of the frozen oreo hot chocolate and it was just as good maybe even a tad bit better! It was a little more on the sweeter side though...so I prefer the original over the oreo.\n\nMoments later, our sandwich comes out and my goodness i was not expecting the BLT to be so huge! - probably a 6 x 6 cut in half...or even bigger! There were thinnly slices of turkey which was stacked to about 3 inches thick (I'm not even kidding), topped with crispy, smoked bacon (sooo good), lettuce, tomatos, the usual...everything tasted so fresh and just soooo good! \n\nI'm so glad we stayed and waited.

I would imagine dining on the outdoor patio as the weather continues to improve would make your dining experience here at Serendipity much more enjoyable. Alas, my dining experience(s) have been indoors. \n\nThe restaurant is centrally located on the infamous LVBLVD, and by central I mean central for passing tourists, not for those who have made a special trip just to dine at this fine establishment. You must park at Cesar's Palace, pack a canteen, and hike to your dining destination. WEAR COMFY SHOES! \n\nOnce you arrive (and find the front door, or side door, or??) you are dumped into the middle of the \"dining commons\" as I like to think of it. It reminds me of a lunch room cafeteria minus the buffet style and mean lunch ladies. \n\nOK, so this place isn't all bad, I promise. The staff has been generally friendly and I'll get to the food in a minute... \n\nIt's been a minute..If you can get past the wacky setup (and the fact you have to walk outside, around the building and through a deserted hallway to use the restroom), you have your pick of enormous eats on this joint's menu! \n\nTHE NACHOS ARE OUTSTANDING! I did venture away from my nacho comfort zone and ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza but...stick to CPK for that little diddy. The pizza was ALL crust, little cheese & toppings..nuff said. \n\nDesert. If you are looking to live on the edge and you want to partake in a desert for dinner evening, this would be your place! DELICIOUS, FATTENING, and FANTASTIC!!! \n\nSo, I give this place 3 stars mainly for their bangin nachos, and decent staff, but it loses the last two stars for layout, location, and well, everything except the food, drinks and staff, haha!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

There was an hour and 1/2 wait for a party of 8.  There was plenty of outdoor tables and the weather was absolutely phenomenal during the month of March. We decided to try out their take out orders.  It's a limited menu but again, we were there strictly for dessert.\n\nWe were in line for 45 minutes.  I don't understand why there was a long wait when the orders consisted of ice cream.  I passed on the frozen hot chocolate - why do I need to spend $15 on a milkshake?  I went with the huge chocolate donut and the Forbidden Sundae which consisted of chocolate cake, chocolate and vanilla cream, whip cream, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.  I waited another 15 minutes for my order to be prepared.  I saw my sundae sitting on the counter underneath an air vent that was melting my ice cream. It took another 10 minutes for the server to grab my donut.  By the time I was handed my sundae, the whip cream turned into milk and spilled over the cheesy cup.  The cake was hard and chewy.  The ice cream underneath and had already turned into mush.  It was the MESSIEST sundae I have ever dealt with.  It was sooo messy, that it got me angry and I just wanted to throw it away! The donut was nothing special....just  big.\n\nThis was the worst experience ever!

Great food, excellent service and fun atmosphere.  We were there on a little vacay last week, and ate there twice.  The first time Kevin was our server.  The hostess promptly sat us with no wait, even though there was one, because we are diamond members.  She was super nice and so was Kevin.  They both remembered us when we came back 2 days later, and made a point to come over and ask us about our stay and activites we did.  The second time I think our server's name was Mylin.  She was super nice, and even though she was busy she took good care of us.  In fact we had to rush out to catch our flight, and even though the table next to us asked her to split a check about 38 different ways, she still got us our bill promptly.   The food both times was amazing.  I'm not big on the frozen hot chocolate, but cold stuff isn't my thing.  I did have an AMAZING mochachino.  And the Mac N Cheese is TO DIE FOR.  I'm pretty amused at all the people who docked them points for being expensive.  Um, hello?  this is Vegas, on the Strip, at Ceasars Palace.  These are probably the same people that have no problem shelling out $30 to get into the Night Club du jour, and then pay $15 per drink while there.  Please.

The \"frozen hot chocolate\" was good, I don't think it exceeded my expectations but was definitely good and I would have it again. \n\nI browsed through their menu and they also offer many other deserts that look just as delicious, everything from banana splits to a $1000 Opulence Sundae.

With the urging of my fellow yelper & friend Linda, serendipity 3 was a must-go for frozen hot chocolate.  The place in NYC was made famous in the movie serendipity but from what I read on yelp, the place gets so busy crowded where an hour wait is the norm.  Well I never did head out to NYC to try it but since I was in Vegas early feb, I made it a point to go.\n\nFirst off, the decor of the place was so sugary sweet w/ vintage chandeliers against pink walls.  We didn't even have to wait long & was seated right away. You can order the frozen hot chocolate in two sizes & oh my goodness, so delish.  We ordered the big size to share btw three.  If I wasn't being polite at the time, u best believe I would've taken the whole bowl & ate it all up - Yumm!\n\nI may just need hit up NYC one day just to say I've gone & been there and  I wouldn't mind having the frozen hot chocolate while I'm at it, of course. :P", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

We spotted the restaurant around 3pm on a Saturday (prime munchies time) while wandering the strip.  Although I've been to Vegas a couple times before, I hadn't had the opportunity to try Serendipity, but this time we made it a point to go.  It was an unusually cold and rainy afternoon (somewhere in the low 50s) and after the hostess told us that the wait would be upwards of an hour, we almost turned our heads down in defeat.  Then, in the corner of my eye, I saw the Serendipity-to-go! Suddenly, I had images of sitting in our hotel room overlooking the bellagio fountain with dark clouds and rainfall, snuggled up while sipping their famous frozen hot chocolate.  It sounded like a dream! We ordered the Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate for Two.  It was made quickly and topped with a generous dollop of whipped cream with 2 long straws.  The size of the frozen treat was likened to that of a Big Gulp than that of a milkshake.  But with the expensive price tag, we were satisfied with the gargantuan portion.  The first sip was light, frothy, creamy, with just the right amount of oreo embedded into each slurp.  We enjoyed the drink all the way back to our hotel room and did not get sick of it even as we reached the bottom of the cup.  I would definitely go back to Serendipity's next time around!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

The proportions were really large as well, so I had enough for two meals. My order also came with the option of sweet potato fries or steak fries. My sweet potato fries were nothing out of the ordinary, but my friend's steak fries were pretty tasty. The inside of the restaurant is very nicely decorated.\n\nSome of the downsides are that the prices are a bit expensive, especially for the cold hot chocolate.

I've probably been here 5 or 6 times and each time the experience was a little different.  It's a bit more touristy than some other locales since it is one of the family/kid friendly spots. Avoid prime eating times to get the shortest wait. It's a bit unavoidable during the summer but you can call ahead for a reservation or just pick up something to go and enjoy the AC inside. Their to-go menu offers most of the items on the regular menu! and for those complaining..you're in Vegas, you should be prepared to spend anyhow.\n\nThe decor of this place is a bit vintage with some really cute touches like the giant sundae by the stairs and the Tiffany's lamps. If it's a really hot day, try to get indoor seating... which will probably bump up your wait. The patio has the water misters and is ventilated but you'll still feel the summer heat. \n\nService isn't bad. They get their food out in a reasonable time but at times it can be hard to get a hold of your server. If you get thirsty while waiting for your table, head over to the bar counter inside and you can get tall cups of ice water.\n\nThe food is in good sized portions, so you're not overpaying too much; its like any designer item, there's a cost for that label. I've tried a bunch of things on the menu but here are some that I can remember well... Kobe Sliders are delicious if you're looking to get something on the smaller side. The foot long hotdog comes with alot of condiments and you can add toppings. The Mac n Cheese was really good. Try the Ahi Salad and the Hangover Omelette! \n\nOrder the Frozen Hot Chocolate. it's probably what you came here for. Don't gripe about the cost because you shouldn't be in Vegas if you're not willing to spend some money. If you don't like it, at least you can say you've tried it. Personally it's a must order when I come. Why? It's different. Some of my friends have pointed out it kinda tastes like Hershey's chocolate but it's a nice alternative to soda and alcohol.\n\nOne day I'm gonna order the Golden Opulence Sundae just to say I've tried it ;) And a trip to their New York location is on my checklist as well !\n\n- jenn", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

Despite my multiple trips to Sin City in the past I'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of \"twisted farm food\" - Hash House A Go-Go.  Having heard that a third (the other in San Diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the Imperial Palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.\n \nWith late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a HHAGG shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt Hash House does everything big.  Taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, Noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  Menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  Hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because \"oh man, we thought this was a buffet.\"  Clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.\n \nSitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  With prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when I chuckled saying okay the response was \"you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it\" - clearly I'm jaded.  Sitting back and listening to Rock You Like a Hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.\n \nArriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  With a sweet, a savory, and a \"dessert\" there was too much food for four people.  Beginning first with the Blackberry Granola Flapjacks, my sister's choice although I'd lobbied for the Snickers Flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  With ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.\n\nPerhaps the most famous Hash House dish would be my order - \"Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.\"  Golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  Stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel I have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  While clearly not as subtle and refined as Bouchon's chicken and waffles I actually much preferred this to Roscoe's famous Los Angeles version and the less famous option at DC's Founding Farmers.\n\nOur dessert would be Andy's famous Bread pudding topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  With the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this bread pudding is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  A portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan.  Buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted Snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  Like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.\n\nSettling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had P.U.B. leftovers and the Robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to the door accompanied by Eddie Van Halen's Eruption.  Generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food Hash House A Go Go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

Doesn't matter of what, just as long as it provides me with some visual entertainment. With food, I love seeing the large and outlandish, quality is secondary and not expected but is always welcome.

We actually didn't even have to wait that long for a table once our entire party was there.

My first instinct was to smash all the solids into a pulp and mix them into my drink so I could suck down the slurry through the oversized straw. Luckily reason found me and I simply made a mini sandwich to munch on while sipping the well-made drink. \n\nI pondered ordering the famed tower of chicken and waffles, but I had a hankering for gravy that only gravy could satisfy. I ordered the biscuits and gravy at the recommendation of our server, based on my request of something large covered in gravy.

It was definitely something that would stick to your ribs. \n\nI also tried a bite of the \"stuffed\" burger and was very let down.

I didn't think I did too bad though, I managed to leave just two waffles behind =).  The Chicken sadly was overcooked this time so overall I had a really doughy and dry meal.  If I had to choose my favorite between the Chicken and Waffles or the Fried Chicken Benedict, the Fried Chicken Benedict wins hands down.  Much more flavor and not very dry thanks to the Chipotle Cream Sauce.\n\nI probably won't be coming back to this location again unless I happen to be at Imperial Palace with a huge hunger attack.

Not to mention, the service was spectacular on both visits. \n\nOur group of 10 dined at Hash House twice for breakfast while in Vegas over Christmas. Staying at the Flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the Imperial Palace and up the escalator dedicated to Hash House. Getting to the restaurant before 9AM both times, the staff was easily able to accommodate our large group. The restaurant was largely empty that early, but did begin to fill up around 10AM. Our servers, on both occasions, were courteous, efficient, enthusiastic, and even charming. For me, that can really put a dining experience over the top. \n\nWhile the food was VERY good, being The Griddle cafe fanatic that I am, I cannot give Hash House 5 stars. Their pancakes (snickers) and french toast did not compare to the deliciousness that is The Griddle. \n\nBUT, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles is note worthy. Perfectly Fried Chicken breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best fried chicken I recall having (although I rarely eat fried chicken). The waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. This was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. The maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really highlighted the dish and I recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. \nIt was just YUM! My boyfriend and I split the dish and it was perfect for two people. The next visit we split the french toast which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread. The banana was disturbing at first being black from the griddle, but was actually delicious and perfectly cooked. It went well with the french toast. \n\nMany people at our table went with the Tractor Special, which was well received and the most traditional style breakfast item they offer. No one tried their hash, sadly. \n\nAny meal on the menu, if you can split it with someone, DO IT! Our server was nice enough not to charge to $2.50 split plate charge. \n\nI do think that Hash House is a \"Must-Go\" while in Vegas. But, sorry, HH, you're not The BEST. xoxo", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

We all had Hash House in SD so decided to try out the Vegas strip location.\n\nTwo of us ended up getting the Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffles.  Yes it's as crazy as it sounds :]] Fried chicken and thick bacon waffles then topped with hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks. Sage on the chicken gives it such a different flavor and what better way to start the day than with fried chicken??  Bacon waffles are filling and the little bits of bacon is a nice smoky touch from the sweetness of the waffles.  The maple reduction and fried leeks are good just by itself. I can drink a gallon of the maple reduction and just eat a salad made of fried leeks.\n\nThe other two went for the Sage fried chicken benedict. Fried... chicken... benedict!  It comes with fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. What a healthy way to start the day huh?\n\nHash House's specialty is what it markets itself as: twisted farm food. It's nothing gourmet and definitely not the healthiest breakfast food around but it's fun, delicious, savory, and guaranteed you won't leave hungry!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

The menu is expansive to say the least with specialties such as the O'Hare of the Dog which is a 14oz Budweiser and a side of bacon! Or the BLT Bloody Mary. They are known here for their Fried Chicken and Waffles which are extreme for sure. Please see a few of the pictures for the full impact. The service here was spot on, all the staff is younger sort of \"punk rock\" which fits the feel in general, but the food left me a bit confused. I never had the signature giant pancake or the chicken and waffles..But I did try several other items and found the experience to be pretty bi-polar. The home made giant biscuits that are given table side (and come with most any entree) are fun due to their sheer girth (that's right I said GIRTH!)...but one bit left me tasting baking soda and begging for honey, or butter, or jam...or anything to quench my now parched gullet. This went the same for their signature \"hashes\" for breakfast. The \"crispy potatoes\" they are all built upon reminded me of the potatoes found downstairs at the buffet...I had the \"Smoked Salmon\" skillet which was the driest experience laid upon potatoes I could have hoped for...Although the skillet meatloaf breakfast was a nice change. The \"stuffed\" burger here are tasty, but beware the horseradish mashed potatoes. I got these for dinner one night and lugged them back to my room. There was SOOO much horseradish on the taters that I literally coughed them right back up. I know I know..Sorry for the visual, but I don't want any fellow Yelper's getting sucker punched by these taters in the future.\nPerhaps I just ordered the wrong items 4 out of 7 meals, but I think if the food completely catches up with the service and hype, then this place is going to be a real Vegas draw!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

Anyone who has read other reviews I've posted knows I like one meal above all others, breakfast.  Though my trips to Indiana have led me to believe that there is little redeeming of that state that borders mine to the southeast, but the Hash House A Go-Go may be it's greatest export.  \n\nWe had large group, so I'm sure that didn't help the wait, but the 2.5 hour breakfast we had was absolutely belly bustingly amazing!  Our waitress was pretty aware of our wait and did a nice job to make sure our group of 6 was well cared for and not waiting long for things like coffee and other refills.  She was also helpful in ordering.  If it's your first time there, I recommend ordering (or talking someone else at your table into ordering) the Chicken Farm Benedict.  This colossal tower of food was a sight to behold.  I went for the Tractor Driver Combo.  \n\nThe TDC was two eggs (over medium), bacon, wheat toast and my choice of pancakes, french toast or waffles.  This would normally be an easy choice (pancakes), but this place isn't your ordinary breakfast joint.  Far from the ordinary, the pancakes, french toast and waffles here are the size of a large platter.  And, with flapjacks like Blueberry Pecan, Brown Sugar Banana, Blackberry Granola, Snickers, Butterscotch Almond, Apple Cinnamon, Mango Coconut, Strawberry Frosted and granola waffles or banana cinnamon french toast...forget-a-bout-it...this is the real deal.  \n\nMy choice was made slightly easier when I saw Brown Sugar banana pancakes.  I think that banana pancakes rank up there with precious jewels, gold bullion and other fine items that ought be cherished.  This was a banana pancake on steroids!  It was incredible.  It was soft on the inside, crispy and caramelized on the outside and delicious everywhere.  If I could have finished the one that I ordered, I would've contemplated ordering a second.  It was worth the gut busting pain that was likely to follow.  \n\nSeriously, if you're in Vegas, and you have the time to wait for a seat, get to this place for breakfast.  Book some time before, and after, as you'll need to wait to get in and head back to your hotel for a food coma afterward.

Those were delicious! It was so good I kept scraping the bottom of the dish to get all of the sauce. Yummy!\n\nSage Fried Chicken and Waffles($19): ...that was delicious too! The chicken was full of flavor and crunchy...yummy...The waffles were super thick though and that's the reason we got full so fast...We did however finish the chicken, but not the waffles. I loved the fried leeks on there was well. It was very flavorful and even though I was stuffed I still sat there chewing on that as I waited for the rest of my family to finish. Or well...attempt to finish all their food.\n\nService:\nGreat!

I get mine stuffed with cheddar & bacon (skipping the avocado), one of three varieties. It comes with a steak knife and a sprig of sage stuck on the top. Tip: Use the knife; you cannot eat this burger whole. The burger is good beef, cooked just right. The side of fries is huge and they are cooked just right. The drizzle of BBQ sauce and the sticks of something add a nice touch. All-in-all, a burger, fries, and a lemonade will run you just over $20 (with tip) and will leave you with a good taste on your tongue, a warm feeling on your belly, and no need to eat for the rest of the day. \n\nI had a breakfast here too, a chicken breast deep fried with a maple glaze, grilled mashed potatoes with bacon, and two eggs w/ fruit & a biscuit on the side. Once again, the dish was huge. The chicken breast was magnificent. The biscuit was flaky and huge. I could not finish. I passed on the overpriced OJ to keep the cost below $15, but once again, this is a meal that can last you the day. \n\nHash House dies not try to be pretentious, like so many Strip establishments. It's hearty food, and while the prices seem Strip-like (that is, 50% higher just because it's in Vegas), the amount you get easily justifies the prices (at least for the food; they must make their nut on drinks, where even soda prices are stratospheric).

Waitress just seemed very harried with the crowd, so we were happy to chill, but really, 30min before we could even place our order was a bit much.\n\nFinally received our food and it was mediocre.  We ordered the corned beef hash, chicken and waffles, and french toast with the bananas.  Of the 3, the french toast was the only one that was decent, though the SD version was better.  \n\nPortions are definitely huge, so probably a good place to go when you're still buzzed (ie impaired taste buds) and have a serious appetite.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

I asked my friend if she read the exclusions prior to coming and she said yes and that everything should be fine.

We ordered the famous Andy's Sage fried chicken and waffles $18.95 for dinner compared to the $15.95 for breakfast/lunch.\n\nWe were given 2 complimentary biscuits which was really filling. I couldn't help but to finish it because our main course took forever! When our chicken and waffles finally came, we then knew we should've shared instead of ordering our own. It came with 2 pieces of chicken stacked with 4 bacon waffles. It was topped with sprigs of rosemary, crispy fried leeks and drizzled with maple syrup. The syrup was really light and not too sweet. The bacon waffles were cooked perfectly. It retained its crispiness even with maple syrup drizzled over it. I love how the bacon was inside the waffle. It was tasty! I am regretting that I didn't even get to finish ONE waffle! I was too full from the chicken :/ next time, I'll bring my husband so he can devour his & MINE. \n\nFor 2 ppl = $21 with restaurant.com gift certificate.

It you are sharing an item there is a $2.25 charge unless you order a side dish so I ordered my own side of scrambled eggs. What this meant was we each had our own eggs and one BIG piece of french toast, half a grilled banana and she ate both pieces of bacon. We also shared a fresh squeezed tangerine juice which was unusual and very good. My mom said it was the best french toast she had ever had for what that is worth! \n\nOur server was Travis and he was nice and helpful with suggestions since this was our first time here. I think he may have psychic powers since he suggested exactly what we were looking at in addition to the popular chicken and waffles. \n\nThey sell the same shirts that the servers wear for about $16 and they have a variety of hats that I think are $21-ish. If you are interested in buying any merchandise tell your server as they can add it to your total bill. Otherwise, you will be like us and making a separate payment at the bar after your meal is over. The sign said they have a lot more items than what they seemed to have in stock. \n\nBottom line: interesting food and atmosphere. Something different than your run of the mill chain restaurants.

The television show spotlights local hot-spots, clubs, restaurants, etc.  The first time I saw them on television, the portions were huge (think Cheesecake Factory) and the food looked absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to visit the eatery until my next visit to Vegas.\n\nMy friend and fellow foodie were dead set on having Hash House for Sunday breakfast before he had to hit the road.  As we made our way to Imperial Palace, I was already drunk an it was only 10 or 11 in the morning.  After parking in the garage, we made our way into the casino and after asking some staff for directions, we made our way towards Hash House.\n\nI was pleasantly surprise that there was no waiting time for our party of two.  After a few more shots, I glanced over the extensive menu and settled for my guilty pleasure of french toast.  My fried ordered some variation of eggs Benedict.  The food took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table and we were both with smiles.\n\nThe french toast arrive an were beautifully presented and resemble a presentation from the Food Network.  The french toast were dense, yet fluffy and were nicely griddled to a golden brown and dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  The french toast were mouth watering and undoubtedly the best tasting french toast I've ever had.  In addition to the fluffy toast, caramelized banana slices accompanied the delicious toast.\n\nHash House A Go Go is a food experience that will forever be embedded in my mind and taste buds.  My friend's breakfast was equally up to par and gave him an equally satisfying food coma.  If I had to compare Hash House A Go Go to something it would be The Cheesecake Factory, but more intimate and with a mom and pop diner feel.  Oh Hash House A Go Go, how I miss you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

I watch as he panics, having prepared no strategy for a serving of these proportions. \n\nI start to panic: I ordered the eggs benedict, too. We should have shared something, we lament. \n\nA couple has chicken and waffles deposited before them. It has a huge steak knife impaled through the mountain of it. It appears they are pulling out their phones to bid their family members goodbye. Or to take pictures. They might not make it through this.\n\nI had asked our waiter about the \"fresh-squeezed\" orange juice. His response is the reason why he's awesome: \"the box SAYS 'fresh-squeezed,' but ain't nobody back there squeezing oranges.\" Thank you, Lonzo. I'll have the lemonade.\n\nAnd then. Our food. Arrives. \n\nJust as I had feared: a bed of potatoes topped with 2 dense biscuits, topped with poached eggs, topped with a slightly spicy sauce of heart-attack doom. I look at the boy; he has his own concerns. I can almost see him beyond the pile of meat hash deluxe-ness before him. I tell him I love him before we start in.\n\nA few pathetic minutes later, we've done all we can. Lonzo knows the symptoms. Still, he refills my bottomless hand-squeezed lemonade, later providing a to-go cup when it becomes obvious I have no more stomach room to give. \n\nIn my deliriously bursting state, I think back to an innocent time, before we placed our orders.

Ever. \n\nMy boyfriend & I saw this place on one of the tourist channels in the hotel and they mentioned it had been featured on Man vs. Food. Now, we both enjoy watching that show but have never had the opportunity to try one of the places where Adam has gorged himself so we knew that we simply had to try this place before we went back home. And in my opinion, it could not have been better.\n\nFirst, I had fairly low expectations for this place because it is in a pretty seedy looking casino on the strip. I mean, I had never even heard of the Imperial Palace let alone knew that it had such an awesome restaurant hiding inside. Also, it was known for having huge portions which typically means to me that the food is going to be just ok.\n\nI was totally wrong.\n\nThe restaurant itself is actually very nice compared to the rest of the casino. It's really spacious and clean, and they play AWESOME music. Also, aside from your average orange juice, they offer tangerine juice. WHO ELSE DOES THAT!? No one, that's who.\nMy boyfriend and I were already loving it just from those two things. \n\nFor breakfast I ordered the Tractor combo which I got with two over easy eggs, sausage and the Brown Sugar Banana pancake.\nThat's right. This was no boring old plain whatever pancake with some bananas sliced on top. \nThis was a HUGE effing pancake with a beautiful crust of brown sugar goodness with at least two whole bananas cooked into the massive cake. OMFG.\nDrool. \nThe delicately flavored moist and fluffy cake gently embraced the bananas as they were surrounded by delicious little pockets of crunchy brown sugar. I was a little closer to heaven with each bite. \nThe eggs and sausage were also stellar, perfectly cooked with surprisingly very little grease. I was very impressed.\n\nMy boyfriend chose the Man vs. Food favorite which was a ridiculous benedict of mashed potatoes and biscuits topped with fried chicken, scrambled eggs, mozzarella cheese and some veggies covered with a chipotle cream sauce. It was HUGE. Definitely the Frankenstein's monster of benedicts if I've ever seen it.\nIt was also very tasty though. The chicken was delicious, again surprisingly not greasy at all. Especially for fried chicken. The chipotle cream was flavorful with a good amount of heat and all the veggies were super fresh. \n\nThe service was also spectacular. Our waitress was super friendly and our food was brought out very promptly, even though she told us that our dishes may not come out at the same time. She told us they don't use heat lamps so they want everything to be served right when it comes out so it gets to you nice and hot. That is fine with me! \nThis place definitely deserves all 5 stars. Great service, fantastic ambiance, amazing food and HUGE portions. \nI will for SURE be coming back to this place as soon as I can. \nI would even drive all the way out to Vegas again just to come to the Hash House, it's that good. Next time I HAVE to try the Chicken & Bacon Waffles. \nYes. They have bacon waffles. \nOMFG.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

I killed more brain cells than I want to consider, and I was so ill from overconsumption that I could hardly sit up without battling the urge to hurl.  It was gnarly, at best.  I am so glad I waited, because Hash House magically cured me.\n\nTake my advice - if you had some errors in judgment during your Saturday night in Vegas, spend your Sunday morning by trekking to the Imperial Palace, wading through the smoke and celebrity impersonators, and taking the escalator to Hash House a Go Go.  Order a coke, and pick a skillet.  I suggest the chorizo.  Devour it.  Then go blow $50 in the penny slots and consume a hair of the dog that bit you.

There was only one time when I actually had to wait for a table, but as always, the wait was worth it.  \n\nA basic bowl of ramen will cost you almost $8.  That's kind of steep, especially in the economy that we're in now.  An extra $1.50 for a hard boiled egg also seems a bit much, don't you think?

It's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. The restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nThe menu is simple. Miso, Tonkatsu, or Shoyu ramen. My favorite is...all of them. Huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  I seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. They give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, green onions, half boiled egg, and kikurage. Its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nAnother favorite is their pork belly bowl. Its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. You get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. Its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. We always get a small bowl and share it.\n\nTheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee fried rice. We need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that Monta is known for.\n\nIts easy to over order food at Monta.

During those three years i've had the opportunity to eat sushi, ramen, bento bowls, curries, udon, miso soups, and other foods of Japanese origins they way they make it and the way they eat it.\n\nThe ramen that is offered here is a step above instant ramen but is FAR from authentic. \n\nThe broths are noticeably lighter and less flavorful from authentic, the noodles are in the middle, they're close but dont have the right texture, sides such as meats are too fatty but seasoned better then authentic ramen.\n\nThe biggest difference is the price. Here a bowl of ramen runs from 6.25 to 7.something which isnt bad but it's the sides that get you back. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg? 1.50 for a spoon full of pickled mustard greens? 2.50 for extra noodles?\n\nBack in downtown Iwakuni a bowl of ramen, a side of goyza, and a plate of kimchi fried rice was only about 700ish yen back in 2006ish. Who would have figured five years later i'd pay double the cash to have a sixteenth a meal...", "type": "review", "business_id": "DjOxXobyGDwWt89q4z1twg"}

I give this place four stars. Although I haven't had the opportunity to eat authentic Japanese food in the land ot the rising sun, the food that is served at Monta is nonetheless delicious. If you had food in Japan and expect this place to be 100% authentic then you may be dissapointed. But if you eat it for what it is then I can promise you that you will not be dissappointed.\n\nIt's like when you have expectations before you watch a movie at the theatre, then you will most likely be let down. But if you watch it for what it is then you will enjoy it, unless the movie completey sucks.\n\nI had the \"Shoyu Ramen\" with extra noodles, and the additions of the egg and pork. The broth was rich with lots of flavor, but the best part was the pork. It was so succulent and flavorful. I recommend adding the chili powder and the sesame seeds to your soup for even more flavor.\n\nService was great and the food is served quickly. Only downside is the price, since all toppings for the ramen are extra charge, so by the time you add on 1-3 toppings you're looking at an average price of about $13 for a bowl. The restaurant is also very small, so prepare to wait for a while if the they're busy, which is most of the time.\n\nIf you love ramen, authentic or not, definitely check this place out, it'll be worth your time.\n\nMonta Noodle House is so great I vow never to give it up, never let it down, never turn around and desert it.

I have eaten at Kaigenro, Ichiza, and elsewhere, but this place is the best in my opinion.\n\nI like the tonkotsu ramen with extra pork.  The broth is great and the noodles are cooked well.  The pork slice is thin and still has some fat layers on it, which adds to the flavor.  I don't get grossed out by it because it is YUMMY!  If you have a saltier taste bud, you might try the tonkotsu/shoyu broth combination.  Personnally, I like the regular tonkotsu best, but you won't go wrong with the combination broth.  I have also tried their gyoza, which was ok and nothing special, but hey, I'm here for the ramen and pork. =)\n\nThe only issue I have about this place is the price or serving size.  The ramen bowl is $6.99.  If you have a decent appetite, you'd have to order extra noodles ($1.50) or extra pork ($2.50), which is ok.  However, if you have a bigger appetite, you might have to order gyoza or other side dishes in addition, which can increase the overall cost of your meal.\n\nIf you have tried Shinsengumi in LA, this restaurant is the most similar in taste.

The tonkatsu is a close second because wow, the broth is super-stick-to-your-ribs rich.\n\nMake sure that no matter what you order, make sure to get extra pork and the amazingly, soft-boiled egg, with a slightly soft and runny center.\n\nGo get your ramen on!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DjOxXobyGDwWt89q4z1twg"}

I am a HUGE ramen fanatic so I would certainly recommend coming here for a bowl of noodle soup or their excellent fried rice; however, do not let the prices on the menu deceive you! It only APPEARS like you are eating a quality meal for cheap; however, if you upgrade your food to the way you want it (extra noodles, toppings, etc.), it actually comes out to more $$ than you'd expect to pay for a ramen place. The bill came out to almost $40 between 3 people, which for a ramen place is HUGE! \n\nThe service was below mediocre. They weren't attentive and they kept forgetting to bring some essentials... like water, soft drink, etc.. We did not go at a busy time, so unfortunately they had no excuse. \n\nMy friend keeps wanting to go back for their fried rice and I wouldn't mind going back to try a different bowl of ramen either :). Just don't go here thinking you'll have the best ramen and service in town from of all the other yelp and magazine reviews, because then you will end up being disappointed like me... Just come here hoping to have some good food and if you have a large appetite, be prepared to spend extra $$ than you expected.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DjOxXobyGDwWt89q4z1twg"}

They have a very simple menu with 3 types of ramen: shoyu, tonkotsu, miso (typical selection) ranging from $6.95-7.50. You also have the option of adding more noodles and toppings for $0.75 -$1.50. They also had gyoza, pork rice bowls, and fried rice. Service was nice and speedy. You can tell the girls here were used to dealing with the crowds.\n\nWe tried the tonkotsu ramen and the kim chi fried rice.  Overall the ramen was quite flavorful but the flavors don't compare to our favorite ramen place in San Diego at Izakaya Masa. Monta noodles are much thinner but not mushy or al dente (the way we like). It's served with a couple slice of pork, Asian mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. But I do like that they have pickled ginger and minced garlic jars out for self service.  The fried rice was decent but unremarkable.($6.95)\n\nOverall, a good dining experience with reasonable prices. However, the restaurant is really small. There are only 5 small tables plus a L-shaped bar area for 8, so I would return only with small groups to avoid a long wait.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DjOxXobyGDwWt89q4z1twg"}

Highly regarded on Yelp! and reported to be committed to local high quality ingredients the small shop was a brief detour and, honestly, how often do I have a car at my disposal in Las Vegas?  Opening at 7am we woke early, loaded the car, and arrived at the restaurant at 7:05 - so early the coffee hadn't even finished brewing.\n\nEntering the restaurant we were greeted sleepily by a young Hispanic woman at the front and seated by a young Hispanic man who would also act as our server throughout the meal.  With water poured menus were delivered and once coffee and tea were optioned for we were told it would be a few moments as water was still boiling and coffee still brewing.  Low on d\u00e9cor we sat back and watched highlights of DeSean Jackson lighting up the Giants on the plasma screen until the young man returned with beverages and took our orders.\n\nWith quality service throughout the meal - coffee refilled frequently and water never empty - we watched the restaurant slowly fill to half capacity while we waited...and from my vantage point I watched the kitchen, a two man operation running the griddles and grills with great speed and skill.  With the time just shy of 7:30 our plates would arrive - each warm, well prepared, and accompanied with appropriate toppings in small plastic cups.\n\nThe first plate, ordered by my sister, was the short stack of Peanut Butter and \"make your own combination!\" pancakes - in her case banana and chocolate.  Served with maple syrup the pancakes were decent but not spectacular - a mild peanut butter taste within and chopped bananas and chocolate chips atop.\n\nMy aunt's selection, a short stack of Red Velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles and served with cream cheese syrup would fare better than my sister's choice, albeit largely only because of the syrup.  Cocoa tinged, thin, and somewhat crisp on the exterior the pancakes themselves were tasty while the addition of the chocolate crumbles lent some textural variation and the whipped cream was expectedly sweet.  In the cup, imagine a mildly citrus cream cheese frosting thinned out - a great idea that worked nicely on both this dish and my selection.  As we'd be dining on Red Velvet pancakes for the next two days I feel obligated to note that these were the worst of the group by a large margin.\n\nFor my choice, Carrot Cakes - certainly the most interesting of our pancake selections with shredded carrots and pecans studding the batter.  Topped with more crumbled pecans and the same lovely syrup served with the red velvet options I actually enjoyed my short stack quite a bit and was glad I'd opted for less food so I could sample some of my mother's choice - the best of the meal.\n\nTitled Honey Toast and described as \"two pieces of thick sliced honey toast dipped in a farm fresh egg wash and cooked to perfection! Then drizzled with sweet honey. Yummy!\" I will have to agree with Babycake's assessment - they were prefect and yummy.  Significant in size and heft the two thick slices of toast were perfectly caramelized on the exterior and custard within while the slowly melting whipped cream and honey proved to be a smooth and sweet balance without being overly saccharine.  While superfluous, I will note the house syrup was actually quite good - it reminded me of the Sweet Syrup at Camellia Grill in New Orleans.\n\nSettling the modest bill - a mere $7.50/each with tax and tip - at the front before making our way to the car we were bid farewell and told to come back soon.  While I'll admit that in retrospect I rather wish we'd have simply gotten some pastries for the road, I certainly did not dislike Babycakes - it just wasn't worth the special trip.  While the small caf\u00e9 would be well suited for a city like Columbus or Toledo, given the quality of the competition in Las Vegas it just doesn't stack up, even if the price is a steal compared to options on the strip - I'd much sooner venture to Hash House a Go Go (on strip or off.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "LCeF1wK5OqP3PPEVBa5Xfw"}

The food is normal breakfast fair.  I did try the buttermilk pancakes and they were o.k.  But like I stated before I am not a pancake person, so maybe this isn't the place for me.  I will maybe come back to try some of the Hawaiian food I saw on the menu and that's about it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LCeF1wK5OqP3PPEVBa5Xfw"}

Knowing I had a day off on MLK day, my mouth started notifying me that it would again like to indulge in red velvet pancakes.  I submitted to the request, and got to Babycakes at just about 9am.  There were 3 tables open, so no wait.  Huge improvement!  It was again a weekday, though, and I noted that 15 minutes after I was seated, there were indeed approximately 10 people waiting.  That being said, I decided to tweak my ordering to include one of the Polynesian elements of the menu, and rather than getting potatoes or hash browns with my over-medium eggs and peppered bacon (yum), I got a mound of garlic and onion fried rice.  Very good call on my part.  The rice was slightly crispy and had slivers of onion and whole cloves of garlic which had a roasted, rather than pungent, flavor.  It was delish with the eggs!  And, as the trip demanded, I upgraded my pancakes to 2 small red velvet pancakes.  My taste buds cried a little.  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "LCeF1wK5OqP3PPEVBa5Xfw"}

I arrived here around 8:10am and was seated relatively promptly.  My order was taken and water on my table by 8:15am.  This is where this turned from a great experience to a bad one.  \n\nI know that this is a relatively small eatery.  It's a mom and pop type business.  The pancakes were good--  a tad too chocolatety... More so than I remember, but I could have just been in a bad mood after waiting 1/2 hour for pancakes.  Are you kidding me?  I'm a solo diner.  I watch full stacks brought out to the table to the right of me and short stacks to my left--literally.  If it didn't take me 1/2 hour to get there, I would have left.  Finally, my waitress notices \"Hmmm... I think she probably came here to eat\" and asked the kitchen where my food was.  They start to argue about if it was put in or not.  I'm thinking, \"Hey, I'm sitting right next to you guys. Can you be more discrete?\"  So they start making the pancakes.  Do I get an apology, an explanation, a \"are you still doing alright\", \"your food will be out in a bit\", or at least some water in my empty glass? You guessed it... No!  That was the insulting part.\n\nLook, I eat out a lot.  I do probably more than I should.  I know that things happen and mistakes are made.  That's absolutely fine.  There will be some human error.  What is not acceptable is keeping the patron in the dark-- especially if I can hear the whole he said/she said conversation... This right here is where restaurants are defined, and this place failed miserably.  To add insult to injury, they put the check on my table literally 3 minutes after I got my food.  I eat fast but really?  Again, really?  You've got to be kidding me.  \n\nI WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS PLACE AGAIN!

Be prepared to get up close and personal with your neighbors table. It's no wonder they have a reportedly long wait for tables, but we got in fairly quickly since we went more towards lunch time.  The husband asked for coffee while we waited, and the hostess was very accommodating. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see Hawaiian foods featured on the menu.  This place has a large selection of pancakes, but also has sandwiches and salads and such if pancakes aren't your thing.  The husband got the portugese sausage with the garlic fried rice option and I got an omlet with a side of the famous red velvet pancakes.  \n\nThe pancakes were as reported: awesome.  The omlet was just ok, as were the potatoes I got with them.  The sausage was ok too, but it would be pretty hard to screw up sausage.  The real disappointment for the both of us was the garlic fried rice.  Sounded so good in theory, but did not deliver.  There was too much garlic in it, and I love garlic.  Also, the rice was Uncle Bens.  I'm sorry, but if you're going to cater to Hawaiian transplants, you gotta come correct with the rice.  It has to be sticky calrose rice, not hard, dry Uncle Bens!  \n\nOverall, this place was decent.

I was fortunate to try both the red velvet and carrot cake pancakes...YUM!  I had the Huntington Omelet both times (without the bacon) which had just cheese, avocado, and salsa served with country-style potatoes.  Good, but not extraordinary.  Coffee and OJ are average, but also good.  There are other unique items on their menu such as the adobo fried rice omelet (adobo fried rice wrapped in an \"egg burrito\") which my hubby liked.  Menu does not include many options for non-meat eaters (like myself), but there is a create-your-own omelet option.  \n\nService was not really good the first time (I got my pancakes after I was almost done with my meal...my hubby got his pancakes with this meal), but the second time was better.  The owner even came around to check on us.  Tables are tiny (if ordering pancakes plus meal, the plates don't fit!) so it's almost better to go as a three-or more party to get a bigger table...or to ask for one of the high tables, which look a little bigger.  \n\nAfter the first visit, I was reluctant to try them again.  But thanks to some coaxing from a friend, I decided to give them another chance.  Although this is not my favorite breakfast place, I would still go back to try more of their unique pancake creations and to support a local Filipino business. \n\nI'm hoping each time I try it, I'll like it better and rate it better.

Omelette was o.k. Nothing special; on the dry side. Eggs were overcooked on this benedict as well.  \n\nService was o.k. We had to flag her down to take our order but she did keep our coffee full without asking. We waited 30 mins. to be seated at 10:30 on a Friday morning.  \n\nI'm willing to try them again but right now not so impressed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LCeF1wK5OqP3PPEVBa5Xfw"}

Mind you I LOVE red velvet cake/cupcakes/yogurt, so this was a must try.  \n\nMy friends and I came at the right time and we didn't have to wait long.  This was probably around 8:45 Friday morning New Year's Eve.  The server was wonderful and friendly.  I of course ordered red velvet pancakes with cream cheese syrup and a cup of coffee.  It was soft and fluffy like a flattened red velvet cake.  I truly enjoyed the pancakes, and so did my boyfriend (we shared a full stack).

We're big breakfast people so when the kids had a day off we went for a visit. The place is clean and bright and was pretty quiet for a weekday morning. \nI ordered the Adobo Fried Rice. Disappointing. The rice has hard and had a few charred pieces of chicken lending it a strange burned off -flavor. The egg \"wrap\" was thin and oily. I can usually finish a whole plate but it was so unappetizing I only had a third. The adobo fried rice rules at Thelmas... check em out. My husband had the Loco Moco and it was alright. It was the standard Hamburger patty and brown sauce found in many valley local places, nothing special. The kids had the children's breakfast - eggs & pancakes. Also nothing special. Our big mistake was getting only a side of Red Velvet Pancakes to \"try em out\". They were heavenly! I almost like em better than Nothing Bundt Cakes Red Velvet Bundt. They came out hot soft and fluffy, with a light puff of whipped cream and choco shaving. There was a side of cream cheese topping which was heavenly drizzled on top. Just lovely. It was funny watching a grown man wrestle over pancakes with a determined and hungry five year old. Priceless. Save yourself some disappointment and go there for the Red Velvet Pancakes... you won't be sorry! \nStaff was very friendly and attentive.  The tables were very small though and crammed together so if you want some breathing room I recommend you come on a weekday cause the weekends are packed!", "type": "review", "business_id": "LCeF1wK5OqP3PPEVBa5Xfw"}

The possibility of trying red velvet pancakes made my friends and I wake up at 8 am on Presidents Day, drive about 40 minutes to Summerlin, and wait 45 minutes to get a table.  Despite all of that, I would do it all over again just to get a taste of those wonderful pancakes.\n\nMy two girlfriends and I shared these three menu items:\n\nRed Velvet Pancakes - yes, it lives up to the hype. The full stack came with 6 pancakes. The pancakes tasted like flat cupcakes and they are to die for. It was the right amount of sweetness. You may expect the whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup to be overwhelming but everything was just right.\n\nRick's Adobo Fried Rice - Adobo chicken is a traditional Filipino dish so my expectations were a little high on this dish. It came with fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in egg like an omelet. It was very tasty and flavorful. We didn't really dig the macaroni salad. Someone was a little too liberal with the pepper.\n\nSpam Scramble - this was the only dish we didn't care for. It tasted as simple as it sounds... Spam with scrambled egg. I guess we just expected something different. This was something anyone could make at home and make it better.\n\nIf I were only rating the red velvet pancakes, I would give Babycakes Caf\u00e9 5 stars, hands down.

Well then, Babycakes Cafe is for you!  The owners of Babycakes are some mighty nice PILIPINO (I say it like my nanay) people!  Have you eaten yet?\n\nBabycakes is packed in the morning especially on weekends because they are only open for breakfast and lunch up until around 2 PM!  So if you can get over your \"What happens in Vegas...stays in Vegas\" hangover get here early!  If you get to Babycakes at prime dining time be prepared for a bit of a wait.  But it's ok because it's worth it.\n\nWe meandered here on a Furlough Friday for us and intended not to spend any money of this day of no pay.  Boy was that a mistake!  We 'accidentally' pulled into the parking lot just to see what the crowd was like.  Once that smell of pancakes and grilled goodies hit me I couldn't help it.  We got out of the car and walked in.  Thankfully, no wait!\n\nI just couldn't keep myself from looking around the dining area and checking to see if I was related to anyone in the place!  So bad...I know!  So many Asian people around me...like I was at a Wow-Wow-Wee taping!  Or a Journey concert with Alan Pineda as the lead singer!  Alas, there was no relatives of mine within the vicinity.\n\nOn to checking out the Babycakes Cafe menu.  Lots of familiar breakfast choices.  Babycake pancakes, favorites, omelettes, benedicts, crepes, all kinds of good stuff!  We ended up ordering the Baby Chick omelette with chicken, mushrooms, spinach, garlic, and cheddar cheese ($9.50), the Two-Egg Breakfast with two eggs, and hashbrowns ($6.25), and a short stack of their famous Red Velvet babycakes ($5.75).  Both of our orders each also came with two buttermilk babycakes included!  Not too shabby!  \n\nThe food?  Delicious!  The omelette was fluffy and had a good amount of fillings, the eggs were cooked great (sunny side up..yum) and my hashbrowns were the way I like em'...super crunchy!  The babycakes were excellent as well, buttery and light.  But damn...those Red Velvet babycakes?  They were pretty bomb!  Topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips?  It was like having dessert for breakfast!  So savory!  Didn't even need the cream cheese syrup.  I will be sure to order a FULL stack of these next time!  And probably not share, ha ha!\n\nBabycakes Cafe also has some stuff on the menu that is definitely Asian/Filipino/Hawaiian inspired.  These guys serve Spam!  Oh yeah!  The king of meats in Hawaii!  Definitely feelin' like I'm home.  Babycakes also has a Kalua Pig Benedict which definitely rings in the islands.  Don't forget Loco Moco!  It's made there too.  They serve Asian inspired Honey Toast!  Japan would be proud!  One of Babycakes biggest specialty sellers is Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  I wish I had ordered it because it looked so yummy!  Steaming hot with a side of macaroni salad included, all I needed was to top it off with ketchup, shoyu, and Tabasco.  Breakfast nirvana I say!\n\nWe'll be going here again soon.  Food was good, service was good, atmosphere is good.  I heard on the grapevine that the members of Jabbawockeez and Super Cr3w frequent Babycakes Cafe quite a bit and they love it!  I didn't see any of them in there the time we visited...but then again, how would I know what the Jabbawockeez guys look like without their white masks on?\n\nGo here for a good breakfast!  It's the most important meal of the day!  If I remember correctly, the lady owner of Babycakes Cafe was super duper, mighty fine lookin', very pretty lady!  Friendly too.

The Adobo Fried rice is good, but similar to a lot of Filipino Adobo at any other Filipino Restaurant and again is pricey. Also, the portions are very average. Its a ten to 12 dollar meal that doesn't really fill you up like island food can, so bring a bag of chips or get ice cream on  the way home  Eggs benedict are good and there are a lot of different styles of it so that cool to try. Red Velvet pancakes are good if you really have a sweet tooth. $4 dollars for three strips of o-k tasting bacon....oh no.....\n\nThe service, its a little slow...its gets really crowded, and the servers can be pretty smug...Half of the servers are really hospitable and the other half seem annoyed. We were a big group and we waited about an hour...\nMy friends Waffles came out so late, that he asked to cancel them...for Waffles....there explanation was that the waffle machine wasn't working correctly and they wanted to make them just right...He cancelled but they still gave it him when our meal was basically done, and they still charged him...really...and they were just O-K.....\n\nI love the ideas in this restaurant, but I expected way more and have had way better food, at a better price with better service.

I'm not kidding.  Even better than the one from Philly.  They caramelize the onions and mushrooms perfectly.  The meat was flavorful and still juicy (hard to do when it's chopped so fine).  The cheese was great and had a nice tang.   Bread could have been crispier on the outside but that's a personal preference.  Have to say...I'm craving one right now.\nPepperoni slices were nice too.  This place cooks until the cheese is just melted.  I can see how other people have had underdone pizzas since they don't blast their pies, but mine was perfect.  The crust was a little crispy and chewy.  I'd say the crust at Metro Pizza is still way better.  But that's an almost perfect crust unless you compare that to the really high end pizza places like Mozza in LA.  The pepperoni tasted just like a nice pepperoni you'd get at the store.  Weirdly, the best pepperoni IMO is at Round Table.  \nVery disappointed they are not open on Sunday.  Either they're religious or they really like their football.  I can't believe the amount of business they're turning away on a Sunday.  But everyone needs a vacation I guess.\nHighly recommended.  Just don't go on a Sunday!

People like Biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses. Great food. Personal service. Owners who aren't happy until you're happy.\n\nIt was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.\n\nWhen we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.\n\nLong story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.\n\nWith our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.\n\nIt goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity!

For reference I've traveled to NYC many, many times, I lived in Chicago for awhile, I've spent a month in Italy and pizza is my favorite food on earth. If I know anything, it's pizza!! I have never been as disappointed in a slice as I was here. \n\nI do laugh when I read Vegas yelper complaints about brick oven places having \"burnt\" pizza. In NYC, many order their pizza extra well done and relish in the beautiful black bubbles that a true NYC pizzeria coal fired oven delivers. The crust here was the most bland tasteless cardboard crust I've ever had. I like crust with flavor and this crust had none. It wasn't chewy, it wasn't crispy, it was just blah. \n\nI thought Metro had the greasiest cheese in town until I tried Biaggio's. I've attached a picture of the disgusting pool of orange that oozed out of every bite. I know some are way into the whole grease thing, but I am not. If you're the type that wants neon orange grease dripping down your arms, this is your place. \n\nIn fairness, I did order the lunch special (2 slices and drink for around 5 or 6 bucks), so perhaps the pizza just doesn't reheat well and I should have ordered a fresh pie? Definitely hands down the most tasteless greasy pizza I've ever had (yup, I'm including Sbarro and Little Caesar's in that!).

Biaggio at Biaggio's Pizzeria has set out to ensure that all of his customers get just that.  \n\nWe are getting married in Vegas this February and I contacted Biaggio after reading all of the awesome Yelp reviews.  Biaggio's enthusiasm was so infectious on the call that I couldn't help but decide to have the reception with this pizzeria without even consulting my other half.  \n\nBiaggio kept using these seductive words like \"stromboli\", \"lasagna\", and \"cannoli\" to name a few.  We decided to have a second phone discussion after I actually told my fiance about the reception so that we could finalize the menu.  Unfortunately....I forgot to call!\n\nNo worries, I called the restaurant and the next morning when he got the message, Biaggio called me right away.  Then he gave me his cell phone number so that I would never miss him again.  It turns out he is only ever out of the pizzeria on Tuesday nights from 6:30pm on, so I could probably catch him there...nonetheless, he wanted me to be able to get hold of him at all times.  That's what I call commitment to customers!  \n\nAfter this discussion, we finalized our menu.  We are starting with three kinds of stromboli --pastrami, chicken & artichoke, and meatball & garlic as well as a salad that will include roasted tomatoes, artichokes, olives, and three kinds of cheese (amongst other tasties).  The main course will include lasagna, garlic knots, and sausage & peppers.  I'm not sure we will still have space for dessert, but just in case, we ordered cannoli, donuts, and he is throwing in 4 lbs of cookies that his friend who makes the cannoli's makes for free.  \n\nOn top of the menu, there will be two people to assist with all prep and mealtime issues; the chef will be on hand, and Biaggio himself will be there to help.  He's even shutting the restaurant down from 6pm to 9pm on a Sunday for us.  Talk about service!!!\n\nBiaggio has requested that when we get down to Vegas we stop by to try all of the items that he will be serving, to ensure they are just what we want.  If they aren't, he assures me he will switch them out with something we do like.  \n\nThis man and this pizzeria have impressed me beyond measure--and I haven't even tried the food yet!  Anyone with this level of commitment to his business and who speaks of his food in such glowing terms is someone I want to do business with.  \n\nAfter the reception I will do an additional review on the food.  If it's even half as impressive as Biaggio himself, I'm 100% sure it will be a 5 star review.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

We had a pizza with sausage and ham, a meatball sub, and the fried dough for dessert.\n\nThe service was great, the young lady and young man were very attentive; they checked up on us several times. We met Biaggio as well, he was very friendly and checked up on us also to make sure everything was cooked properly. Service was A+.\n\nAs for the pizza...crust had nice texture. It was crisp enough on the bottom to hold up to the toppings but still soft enough in the middle to fold and provide a nice chew. You won't get the smoky slightly charred crust from a coal fired brick oven which I personally love (since some yelpers have wondered about the oven), but you will get a nice thin crust pizza with a good bite to it. A previous yelper had said the cheese was too greasy, but it was fine in my opinion. Perhaps it did make a difference that he didn't have a whole fresh pie. I liked the sausage quite a bit, the ham was good but nothing special as far as I could tell. I found the sauce to have a nice flavor to it, it was fairly zesty and not too sweet like some other pizzerias. This is just MY personal preference, but I like my sauce to be slightly thicker or more paste-like than the sauce on the pizza here. However, if I had to choose only one between taste or thickness I'd still choose taste. Overall, definitely one of the best pizza options in Summerlin. Plus they deliver! \n\n*On a side note, I noticed one of the yelpers on here was talking about not being able to get delivery on football Sundays. Funny, cuz I talked to Biaggio about that when I was there. I also order pizza almost every Sunday during football season. Biaggio said he would be able to parbake the pizza and deliver it on Saturday. Since the parbaked pizza would only be half cooked, you would be able to finish the baking process on Sunday and have a fresh baked pie right out of the oven. Seems like a fair solution to the store not being open on Sundays.\n\nAh, the meatball sub. I have to say it's probably the best meatball sub I've had since I moved here several years ago. They get their rolls from a local bakery here in town and they make their own meatballs. Using a nice blend of beef, pork, and veal along with a healthy dose of garlic equals winning recipe for meatballs in my book!\n\nWhen it was time for dessert I asked about the zeppole and Biaggio explained it to me. Unfortunately he was out of the raspberry dipping sauce which he said just elevates the dessert to another level. So he recommended we try that next time when he has the sauce. Instead, he offered the fried dough which was served warm with a quick basting of butter and dusting off cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar. This was a really nice dessert, the dough wasn't too heavy and it was slightly salty and slightly sweet. We enjoyed it very much. To top it off, Biaggio gave us the dessert for free since we weren't able to have the zeppole with raspberry sauce. How nice is that?\n\nI was told the star item of the restaurant is the pastrami stromboli. I LOVE pastrami, so I'll definitely be going back and trying that!", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

On a certain weekday, I had a craving for cheese and marinara and decided to get a pizza. \n\nI came to Biaggio's with a friend and we each ordered 2 slices of pizza. These slices are huge. One slice was actually more than enough for me. I ordered the cheese and Biaggio suggested I get the artichoke and roasted tomato slice. I'm not a fan of artichokes so I wasn't exactly excited but decided to take him up on that suggestion ($6.64 for 2 slices and the largest soft drink I've held in my hand).\n\nThe cheese pizza was fine but the other slice with the artichokes and tomatoes was out of this world. It had little pieces of roasted garlic on it that just brought the pizza to the next level. \n\nMy friend had the combination pizza and said it was good. She was eyeballing their breakfast pizzas (eggs instead of marinara) and Biaggio was nice enough to give her a slice on the house. \n\nBiaggio is a nice guy that seemed genuinely interested in all his customers (the place was pretty much full during lunch).

Good, old fashioned traditional hand made pizza with thick but crispy crust; stretchy, chewy, and delicious cheese; and marinara with fresh tomato taste. I was informed that there was no salt or sugar added to the cheese or sauce and the only salt that was used was in the dough, so the pizza is very natural and healthy compared to others. \n\nIt was my first time, but I have a feeling that Biaggio will get many more visits from me.

The pizza and everything else is simply amazing.\n\nMy friends and I went to Biaggio's because I was amazed at how good their ratings were.  When we arrived we were the only ones there so the owner came out from the kitchen to talk with us. The owner, Biaggio, just emanates with pride in knowing that he uses the freshest and finest ingredients whenever possible.\n\nMy friends and I order two vegetarian pizzas, one with mushrooms spinach and ricotta and another with eggplant and garlic, garlic knots, and french fries.  The garlic knots arrived first and they were amazingly moist and garlicky.  When the pizza arrived we were in for a real treat.  The first pizza we received was the mushroom spinach and ricotta.  The first bite was simply delicious.  In my previous experience both mushrooms and spinach have the tendency to make the crust of any pizza turn into a watery mess within a matter of minutes; but Biaggio's crust is quite nearly perfect.  The crust had the right balance of crunch and chewy, yet it held up to all the toppings without going limp, unlike the certain times when I eat at Grimaldi's.  The next pizza arrived, the eggplant is battered and fried before its topped on the pizza, which was a very nice surprise.   \n\nBoth the quality of the ingredients and the friendliness of Biaggio will have me going back there many times.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

The stromboli was cooked to perfection, and the trio of meatball, pastrami, and chicken/artichoke covered the spectrum very well (though a veggie-only one might have been a good experiment as well).\n\nThe lasagna, though, completely blew my mind.  The sauce was rich and flavorful, the mozzarella was CLEARLY fresh, and the meatballs were spiced to perfection.  I would be a very large man if I had the chance to eat this every day.\n\nThe cannoli capped the evening out with a crisp, delicious shell and a cream that was surprisingly light.  Perfect way to end an evening.\n\nThe staff's energy was what truly gave this the last half star, though - Like I said before, Biaggio was engaging and informative during the whole dinner, and he really seems to pour his soul into the food he's making.\n\n\nI should clarify - I'm not sure what the full extent of his daily menu is.

He told me the ingredients he uses, bursting with pride as he described his methods to create his perfect pies.\n\nMr. Biaggio himself LOVES to give hugs. He is such a sweet, handsome man. I really like how he makes me feel appreciated every time I enter his establishment.\n\nToday he surprised my husband and I with a complimentary order of wings. His wings are to die for! Great, crispy coating on the skin, juicy (not greasy) chicken and good amount of meat! Not just a little one biter either!\n\nBiaggio's Pizza is a gem among pizza places in Vegas. I am so glad to have found him! \n\nWe have pizza at least once a week, sometimes we have him deliver to us, sometimes we go to him, for the food AND the conversation Mr. Biaggio provides.\n\nHe will also deliver ANYWHERE in town!

Without hesitation, she gave me her card and ordered the $5.95 two slices of pizza and a drink.  Since I was flying, she said she was buying.  I couldn't wait to try out the pizza's since the last time I wasn't feeling well so I couldn't enjoy the food as much as I wanted to.  My boss also was craving for some garlic bread and ordered that as well.\n\nMr. Biaggio was really nice and remembered me from the last time I visited.  It's really impressive how he remembers his customers.  It's rare to find an establishment like this.  The last time I felt warm and fuzzy in a restaurant was in BFG Chicken Strips.  But that's a different review in itself.\n\nI finally got my mouth around the pizza and mmmm mmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm, I realize what my boyfriend meant when he said it tasted so good.  Also, what tasted even better was their garlic knots.  The heavenly taste was just \"To Die For!\"  Mr. Biaggio you definitely have the right words when you describe your heavenly creations.\n\nAfter work I decided to treat my boyfriend to Biaggio's Pizzeria and he decided to get the meat lover's pizza while I chose the spaghetti with two meatballs.  The combination of the sauce with the meatballs with the spaghetti sauce tasted like an atom bomb.  \n\nI am definitely a fan and will order only their pizza from now on.  Thanks for an awesome heavenly pizza experience Mr. Biaggio.  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

The first 2 times were quite good and I would've definitely recommended them to our friends & family. The owner was friendly and was very welcoming on both occasions. The 3rd and now our 4th time ordering and I'd be hard pressed to go back or recommend them to anyone.\n\nThis time we ordered a pizza with mushrooms & ricotta cheese. When I arrived to pick it up I looked at the pizza and voiced my concern that the lack of mushrooms was disappointing and the same thing had happened previously on our 3rd order. The guy at the counter said \"I'll write it down\" as if that was going to take care of anything with the immediate situation. I was rather puzzled by his response but didn't feel like arguing with him about what good customer service was and how he should've handled the situation.\n\nAfter arriving home from a quick 5 minute drive we found our pizza to be an undercooked cheesy swamp and as noted before a distinct lack of mushrooms. The pizza was impossible to eat in any normal sense of the word and wouldn't even stand up to the folded NY style of eating a slice. I've attached 2 pictures, bad iPhone shots, showing our pizza and what it looked like prior to and after trying to remove a slice after using a knife to re-cut it.\n\nWe were very disappointed as we really liked the flavor of their sauce and the ingredients.

This place is AWESOME!!! Everything about this restaurant is 5+++++++ Stars! From the exceptional front line service of Mr Biaggio and his daughter all the way down to the ingredients that he uses, you can tell Mr Biaggio takes his restaurant seriously. We really enjoyed being able to meet and chat with Mr Biaggio himself! What a great guy to take the time to get to know and meet his customers! Between the two of us, we ordered the garlic knots, chicken parm sub, and a small supreme pizza. There are no words that can express how delicious the food is here. All I can say is that you must visit Biaggio's Pizzeria when you're in the area to understand exactly what I mean. You can most certainly feel and taste the love and pride that goes into all of the food made here. The ingredients that he uses are of fine dining quality and his recipes are authentic. I will now review the 3 items that we ate. \n\nGarlic knots: \n\nTo die for!!! These garlic bread knots have the perfect crusty outside with a soft and chewy middle. The garlic knots are complemented with a marinara sauce that is perfect in consistency, texture, and flavor. We were shocked when Mr Biaggio told us that he does not use salt in his marinara sauce. The medley of spices and herbs that he uses in his sauce make up for the absence of salt. The garlic knots are buttery with the perfect amount of garlic used. He also uses real shredded Parmesan cheese to top the garlic knots and not the cheap, powdery stuff that comes out of a can. \n\nChicken parm sub: \n\nThe bread used for this sandwich is fabulous! Mr Biaggio told us that the bread he uses for his sandwiches are made by an older Italian gentleman who has been making bread for years! One bite into the bread and you can taste the years of experience that went into making the bread. The crust is perfectly crusty with a soft and chewy middle. The taste is perfect. You can tell that the bread maker is a master of his craft. The chicken inside the sub is plentiful and has a perfect balance of seasoning. Once thing that we noticed about his chicken parm sandwich that is different from others is that he cuts up the chicken into bite size pieces which makes eating this sandwich easy and quite pleasurable. And of course, as I mentioned above, the marinara sauce used in this sandwich was perfect and complemented the sandwich well. \n\nSmall supreme pizza: \n\nSmall!!? This pizza was quite large for a \"small size\". The toppings he used were plentiful and of superb quality. The amount of sauce and cheese used was perfect. The pizza's crust was quite tasty and enjoyable all the way to the crust. There is a perfect balance of the amount of toppings and sauce that he uses because the pizza was not a soggy mess like some other pizza's that flop and sag. Our pizza was quite enjoyable down to the last bite! \n\nIn summary, Mr Biaggio and his daughter go out of their way to make you feel at home. Their warm and friendly disposition make you feel as if you are eating in their families home. The food here is amazing and very plentiful. The prices here are low and very affordable. The quality of the food is of fine dining caliber without the high prices and the recipes used here are authentic and perfected. Our whole experience here was a 5++++++ Star one and we will definitely be back next year for more. Would I recommend eating here? Are you kidding me? YES! YES! YES! You will not be disappointed! The only bad thing about eating at Biaggio's for us is that now since we do not live in Vegas, we'll have to wait a whole year till we can have more! Eating Italian food anywhere else will not be the same for us now that we know how Italian food is supposed to taste like thanks to Mr Biaggio!

When I arrived to pick up my order, he asked that I not post on Yelp what he was doing to fix my previous visit should I happen to change my review. I said that I would not. Then he proceeded to tell me that he didn't open his business to be a 2- or 3-star business and that \"wasn't the service\" I got there. To me, that basically means he is calling me a liar, and I told him so. He denied this. I told him that I used to work at a pizza place and that isn't how you do business. He said that he had nothing to offer me besides the garlic knots. I told him that I ordered enough food that night for my family to eat dinner and that  we ended up hungry because he was busy and all he gave me that night was a shrug and said, \"We're out.\" He again said that it didn't happen, and that's when I got even more mad.

Whatever happened to \"The customer is always right?\" When did it become \"The customer is a liar if he says he had bad service?\"  All he had to do when I came in was say, \"I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I hope this one was better,\" and I would have been a returning customer. As it is, I will never go back.

For being 2 weeks old, I was VERY impressed that the staff never missed a beat.\nAs far as food goes...I had the Lobster Roll and the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. The Lobster Roll was amazing...almost like I was in Boston.  The Lobster Mac n' Cheese was also very good, but the most impressive part about the dish was the tiny bite size Lobster BLT served to the side.  It has so much flavor you want more.\nI was able to try some of the shakes, but one that stood out was the Campfire S'more.  I just remember the tastiness of the shake...then the warm sensation of the alcohol going down my throat.  What I like better was the malt.\nEveryone in my group was too full for dessert, however, the staff brought out the Candy Shop item off the menu in celebration for my birthday.  The only way I can describe it is that it had an interesting array of flavors and textures.\nI've been going to Vegas for a long time and this is the only place on The Strip where you can get a GREAT sit-down meal for reasonable prices.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

I was a little, um, rough from 2 consecutive nights of partying, and the burgers here dazzled my taste buds and satiated my poor stomach.\n\nWe started with Radicchio Salad which was large enough for two to share as a starter and was perfectly tossed and loaded with fresh parmesan.  We split a Korean Bullgogi Burger and a Gold Standard Burger, and trying to pick the better of the two would be like trying to pick the more obnoxious twin between Mary-Kate and Ashley.  The Gold Standard was a glorious pastiche of meat and cheese, vegetable and fruit, starch and sauce.  And then the Bullgogi, with the glaze, the egg, the trite kim-chi whatever-it's-going-to-be to make the dish \"Korean\" (in this case, kim-chi slaw) worked equally well together to create a fabulous burger.  I would urge anyone to order either of these but all of the burgers looked appetizing on the menu.\n\nMy only regret (due to an impending drive back to LA) was not being able to try one of the alcoholic shakes.  \n\nOh! And since they mistakenly brought out the salad with the burgers (I asked for it before the burgers, naturally), they offered us a complimentary whimsical dessert sampler (I think it's \"The Candy Store\" on the menu) that was great; save the mini-drumstick cones for last!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

It's pretty unbelievable to me that anyone gave this place a decent review for anything but the shakes, which to be honest... were fantastic.  Quite possibly some of the best shakes I ever had.  So why just one star?\n\nWell...  When I go somewhere that specializes in burgers, I'd expect the burger to be great, at least good...  I would have even settled for mediocre...  Instead, it was easily the worst burger I have ever had...  I'd take McDonald's over this (I hate McDonald's), and for the price I could have had McDonald's 10 times over.  \n\nSo how bad was it?  Well...  Ever had a burger that was cooked on charcoal before all the butane finished burning off?  Well... this was worse.  This was kind of like directly eating that charcoal...  So maybe I just got unlucky with that ONE burger?  No such luck, because the waitress took it back, exchanged it for another, DIFFERENT burger, and it was almost as bad.  At this point, I am not sending it back again because I certainly don't want them to spit in it.\n\nI really wanted to like this burger.  Hell, I wanted to LOVE it.  The descriptions and promised flavors were so enticing...  But all I could taste was burnt charcoal.\n\nThe waitress said that some people are extra sensitive to the charcoal flavor, but my friend had the same bad experience.  Besides... this is the first and only time I have ever experienced a burger like that. \n\nIf I ever go back to Cosmo, I might have a shake there, but never another burger.

I recommend EVERYONE try that one!  \nIt came with shoestring fries which was also perfect.\n\nI tried my friends Duck fat fries but I didn't see anything special in them. \nBut I also tried her strawberry milkshake and that was SO GOOD! I don't think any other shakes will taste as good as that one.  \n\nMy only concern was their service.  When our waitress took our order, we must have waited 45 minutes before we even got our shake... Our waitress even asked us like 30 minutes in if we ordered the shake.  When we said yes, she said it was coming right out.  Liar. \nI was just a little irked because the people who sat next to us, came in AFTER us and got their food BEFORE us! WTF? \n\nBut whatever, the food TOTALLY made up for it. =)\n\nAll in all, great place! Just needs to get their service upgraded.\n\n4 Stars!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

It is the perfect marriage of flavor without being to overpowered by the booze. \n\nOn to the grub. \nStarters: \nPhilly Cheez Steak Spring Rolls with udder sauce $11 \nThey were alright, but could have used more seasoning. The meat was tender and the rolls were crisp. I did not enjoy the utter sauce which bares similarities to ketchup, but with more vinegar. \n\nFor the beef and fake beef selections we had: \nThe Classic with Two Dollar Cheddar (ridiculous) $15 \nUrth Burger with One Dollar Swiss $14 \nNew Delhi Chicken $14 \nAll served with shoestring fries and that gross utter sauce. I ordered Ranch, of course, and they turned out to be the winner of best potato in a supporting role to compliment the Monkey Shake. As far as the burgers go my burger was ordered Medium and came to me very well done. I ate one third of it. The bun was buttery and toasted to perfection and that two dollar cheddar was worth it. The veggie burger was probably my favorite of the three with a strong mushroom taste. Pretty good. The Chicken burger could have been executed better. The chicken lacked taste and the only saving grace was the apricot-date chutney on top. \n\nOverall I will absolutely be back because The Cosmopolitan is a good time and that shake has my heart and waistline captive. The menu has tons of creative options that intrigue me such as Bull's Balls, Crispy Pork Belly Bun and Duck Confit Street Tacos.

Though, the popcorn is far from anything special and really isn't that good. 2 stars.\n\nIt took a rather long time for my milkshake to arrive. And honestly, they might as well not have bothered. I had the Strawberry Cheesecake milkshake from their Bam-Boozled Shakes menu (a.k.a. \"adult\" milkshakes). It was drinkable, but lacked any depth of flavor. After having the \"adult\" milkshakes at BLT Burger, this one just couldn't even begin to compare. I didn't even come close to finishing it - and I didn't want to. 2 stars.\n\nThe kettle chips were extremely delicious. Some of the best kettle chips I've ever experienced. And the dip was delicious. It was a french onion based dip, but there were other things going on and a tang of vinegar. Though, despite the menu description of \"blue cheese flavored\" chips, I didn't get any blue cheese coming through. But nonetheless, so yummy. 5 stars.\n\nThe Sonoran Border Hopper was basically two mini hot dogs topped with a strip of bacon, a little bit of salsa, and some drizzled guacamole, with a cup of beans served on the side. Far from a traditional Sonoran dog, but quite tasty. The buns were absolutely perfect, the dogs pretty good, and all the flavors came together with a very nice smokiness and crisp freshness.

Didn't have a burger! Instead, had drinks, \"appetizers\" (turned out to be plates bigger than appetizers) and desserts. The classic martini was terrific, I got the GIN variety (does no one drink gin in this town?), containing a gin of which I had never heard (\"Nolet Silver\"?) which was floral and smooth, garnished with pickled shallot. (Expecting shallot bulbs on a stick, instead it was shaved in the bottom of the glass!) Another had a\"bloody mary\", which came \"up\", containing pepper/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it! Food was \"fried pickles\" (fried dill spears, fried olives, caper berries, prosciutto, salami w/ herb-caper mayo), \"street tacos\" (crispy shells filled w/ shreds of duck confit, foie gras, trufle crema & cranberry relish), \"truffle lobster mac n cheese\" (maine lobster, black truffle & mac in a tallegio-marscapone sauce), and \"Bull's Balls\" (2 risotto rice balls stuffed with veal, topped with \"tomato fondue\" and a slice of lardo). A very rich, decadent collection of dishes, I thought all were very well done, especially the mac (WOW!). The \"Bulls' Balls\" weren't as good as I had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the \"tomato foudue\", which was genius. (An angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) The \"street tacos\" were really good but really rich. My fave thing on the \"fried pickles\" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). Ended with a \"stout float\" (Guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. After food we had a really wacky concoction: \"Johnny Apple Seed\", consisting of Knob Creek, honey and apple cider. First of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what \"hard cider\" was! We had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. No matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! AHEM! But a great idea, IMHO. Sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! So overall, I'd say GO.

I love a good burger, and shakes with booze...yes please!! \n\nI was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. Not a problem, that's not unusual. By the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. We were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. Because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. They attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. We quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation. \n\nLobster corn dogs: good, but not great \nFried pickles: extremely tasty! \nLobster mac n cheese: I only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful! \nPhilly steak egg rolls (I think): ehhh \n\nSo far so good...I was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! I kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. I can't complain. I had it with steak fries which were also good. The overall consensus of the group was that the food was good. \n\nSo why the 2 stars? While the food was good, maybe even great, the service was TERRIBLE. Wait, I have to clarify, half of the table's service was terrible. While Pete's side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, Nicole's side of the table had several problems... \n\n1. the birthday girl ordered a classic burger with Cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon, wild mushrooms and NO TOMATOES. What she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. While I acknowledge this was not Nicole's fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! And throughout the whole time Nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates. \n\n2. Someone else ordered a burger (I honestly can't remember which one) with brie and grilled onions. When she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for Cheddar instead. This also took a ridiculous amount of time. \n\n3. Someone ordered a beer that never came \n\nDuring this time another one of our party decided to say something to the Manager, Steve. As soon as we said something to him, he brought the burgers out. He was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. The second burger was supposed to have grilled onions and it didn't, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let Steve now, he immediately said \"Oh no, there are grilled onions on there, I saw them put them on\" Then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on the burger. Obviously Steve was left a little red in the face. To his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. The birthday girl couldn't even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat. \n\nThe duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and I also enjoyed the onion rings. \n\nOh and the server (who's name I didn't catch) who was pouring drinks, then \"tying his shoes\" while we talked to the manager...you're not slick dude.  We know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn't you we were complaining about.\n\nWhat is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

Good lookin' out!  I was leaving the Cosmopolitan after the Black Keys show, hungry and bitter that both Jaleo and China Poblano had stopped serving food.  Suddenly, a friend texted me from HSB saying they had vegan options!\n\nI traversed the mob of drunken concert-goers and arrived poste haste, just in time to put in the last to-go order of the night!\n\nThe main vegan options are the Urth burger sliders (2 for $8, comes with delicious homemade-tasting potato chips) or the proper full-sized Urth burger ($13, comes with a side of fries).  I went for the sliders, since I  have not had a slider since I was knee-high to a grasshopper back in TN eating at Krystal's.  \n\nVerdict - Fries were awesome, chips were awesome, Urth burger was so-so.  It was a mix of veggies, and maybe chickpea flour? It had a falafel-ish character to it.  It was nicely fried on the outside, but pretty mushy.  It came topped with avocado, cucumber and sprouts (see pic) on a fluffy bun that was not egg-washed.  It's nothing that I'd go running back for, but it's a solid option for late-night eating when your carnivore friends insist on burgers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

My fiance and I chose Holsteins this past Sunday. We arrived at 8pm and the hostesses asked if we had a reservation. We did not, and they weren't seating until 8:45pm without reservations, which is fine, so we went to another fine Block 16 Hospitality establishment across the street--Pinks--as we were in a hurry. \n\nAfter eating our delicious hotdogs, we went back to the Cosmopolitan and asked the hostesses if we could make a reservation for after the concert we were headed to that evening. They told us that we couldn't make a reservation but it shouldn't be a problem as their last seating was 11:45pm. \n\nFast forward, the concert ended and we hurried over to Holsteins and arrived at 11:30pm. We waited our turn in line and then the hostess informed us that they were no seating. Now I'm upset so I complained and asked for a manager's contact information and instead of giving it to me, they seated me. \n\nThe service by our server, Scot, was TERRIBLE. He was clearly bothered by our late seating, noting upon arriving at the table, \"Well, you guys sure got a late seat\". Not hello. No greeting. Terrible. He took our orders (food and drink) all at once so that we could make it a faster dining experience. My milkshake came out as did our friend's diet coke but my fiance's Miller Lite didn't come and then the food arrived. I asked the runner about the beer and 5 minutes after the food arrived, Scot runs by, slams an unopened can of Miller Lite down on the table and then runs away. He didn't inquire about our food. He didn't open the beer. He was just generally absent from the entire experience and made us feel rushed and unwelcome. \n\nThe food was delicious but overcooked. I asked for my burger, The Gold Standard, rare and received a burger that was tan with a hot pink center. Same for my fiance. Additionally, both of us became violently ill about 2 hours later that evening. As someone who works in the service industry living in a town that revolves around service, this experience was extremely disappointing.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

Would you prefer it warm or cold?\" And so I ordered it medium rare. And out it came, warm and red and juicy Kobe beef. I was shocked that for once I didn't have to overcompensate in my ordering just to get a decent amount of pink in my burger. The toppings were perfect (you can't not love tempura avocado, really), and even the teriyaki glaze, which I was skeptical of, wasn't overpowering. The shoestring fries that accompanied it were great, especially with a side of truffle mayo.\n\nOn top of everything, our server was excellent and very attentive, which in my experience hasn't been the norm in Vegas restaurants. Holstein's reassured me that there, in fact, IS good food to be found on the Strip, and I will certainly be returning here on my next trip.\n\nUpdate: I FINALLY got back here and had the Gold Standard burger this time. A little overcooked, and not as bold in flavor as the Rising Sun. Also, the fries were thicker and not as crisp--why the change?!

Nobody was rude to us, our waitress was attentive and everything came out in timely fashion.\n\nDrinks - This is definitely worth 1-2 stars on its own. They make what they call \"adult vitamins\" which are drinks that use Vitamin waters as their bases. Basically Vitamin water plus vodka/gin and some additional fruit juices. I know it sounds like pretty ridiculous but why not?  They were tasty and pleasant drinks after a long day. They were fairly strong. They also offer milk shakes with alcohol...you know you want it!  If I'm ever back at this place, I'll probably try one of these out. \n\nFood - Mostly burgers and variations on the concept. They make a good effort at gourmet or fusion-y type burgers - burgers made of duck, lamb, etc. or with various ethinically inspired toppings.  I appreciate the attempt, but I do think that if your place has the name of a type of cow in its name, you should probably offer at least a handful of beef burgers. \n\nAnyways, I had the \"Classic\" which is a beef patty-based burger with cheese. It was fantastic! Perfectly cooked and juicy. The patty itself maybe had a touch more salt than it needed but when eaten with bread, condiments, and toppings its fine.  The bun was nicely toasted and buttery. The Classic is your standard burger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, and onion.  You can add on varying cheeses or a number of other toppings (fried egg, bacon, mushrooms, beef brisket, etc). \n\nI like the offerings and variety of flavors and palettes this place can appeal to.

A group of us came here for a birthday. We called ahead of time to make a reservation because it was a mid size group and around the holiday season. When we got there, the place was busy, but you could get away without making a reservation.\n\nThe decor is warm, well lit, with splashes of colorful art. \n\nThe server was friendly, attentive when we needed her, and kept her distance while we were celebrating. Orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.\n\nThe star of this place is the food. The ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. The alcohol milkshakes are amazing. They will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. We tried four different kind that day. The Framboise float was not well balanced. Although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. On the other hand, the campfire smores, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. They had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.\n\nStarting out with the artichoke \"guac\" was unimpressive. In fact, looking back, I cannot remember it as vividly as I do with everything else we ordered.\n\nNow the burgers are spectacular. If you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. My group had our burgers family style to share. We got two gold standards; aged beef, smoked bacon, goat cheese, greens and aioli. They were delicious. The meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with the burger. Next was the captain hook; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. The fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. Now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. The longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey BBQ sauce. This monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. Nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. The duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. When you bite into the succulent patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. The blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. If you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout. Top it all off with a few orders of duck fat fries and you might as well check into the hospital next.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

Wicked Spoon tries to be a little different and they succeed in many ways. I'm giving them a 5 for now, even though they do have a few issues that will hopefully be ironed out once they are open longer. \n\nBased on reviews from other Yelpers, they seem to still be trying out different things since some of the items mentioned by others were not present when I was there and I'm sure I had some things that others did not have. I ended up eating here twice my last trip. I enjoyed it so much I cancelled my steakhouse reservation to eat at Wicked Spoon again. The items were definitely different on both nights. Even the presentation was different on some of the items. They have a really good cold bar. I ate several of the crab and shrimp cocktails. This is a great place for those who have eaten at all the other buffets and are looking for a change of pace. I lost count of the number of items they offered that you really can't get at any other buffet. While other new buffets try to be more and more extravagant, this one tries to be different. with great results. My favorite item was the blackened lamb ribs. \n\nNow for the areas that need improvement. Service is definitely an issue. The line moves slow, although I think that can be credited largely to the buffet being new and people are still getting used to their jobs. It seems like they will eventually have some self serve kiosks, but they were not being used when I was there. The servers also seem to be overwhelmed. They may want to consider hiring more servers since the nature of this buffet (small plates, pans, baskets, bottles, etc.) generates more that needs clearing. That being said, the service was friendly and very good, if a little slow. The servers seemed really proud to be there though, which is always a good thing. They also need to stock cold plates in the cold bar and dessert sections. The dessert selection is a bit small. I wish they had some little cakes or something. \n\nThe Asian food section is the one that needs the most work right now. It was the weakest section and needs more variety. I'm guessing their chef has very little experience with Asian cuisine since even the simple dishes were messed up. The Korean short ribs, for example, were overcooked and drowning in sauce.

Just walking into the new Cosmopolitan is an amazing experience.\n\nOnce you make your way to the second floor for the buffet, you are encountered with splashes of modern art, including oversized sculptures of high heels; very sexy! The whole vibe is very trendy, hip and modern. The staff is very friendly and helpful. \n\nWe were seated in our special req. booth without a problem.  We headed to the buffet and I couldn't believe the humungous selection of items! I read about the tiny dish distribution, so I knew what to expect, but I didn't think there would be such a variety. I have been to practically every buffet in Vegas, and usually make my way around the whole thing on the 1st round, but I only got through half of this place the first time around!\n\nAlmost every item I tried was highly delectable! One of my favs was the braised beef with pasta & mushrooms, yummmmy! The roast chicken and mashed potatoes were also divine, perfectly cooked and seasoned! Even the salad was above the norm, with tasty, high quality, applewood smoked bacon.\n\nIt seemed like every dish was made of the finest quality of ingredients. This was a major bargain, 20 bucks for a gourmet lunch with endless, delicious selections! \n\nThe only negatives were the mac & cheese, which lacked seasoning & the santa fe style corn bread bake, not my thing, food labels would have been helpful here.\n\nThe desserts were beyond amazing as well, the salty peanut & pistachio ice cream tasted like they were homemade, and those madelines were mighty tasty. \n\nI highly recommend this buffet!! As a gal who is known as \"The Queen of the Buffets\", I give this one 5 stars!!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

For such an upscale and luxurious casino, you would think that their restaurants have to be top-notch and at their best. Unfortunately, that was not the case when I went.\n\nThe Good: $20 for lunch at a very nice place is not that bad. There was a variety of food, most of which were served in individual plates, which is different compared to most other buffets in Vegas that serve their food in big trays for you to scoop out of. There was a good selection of meats (definitely try the lamb if you can), a small sushi bar, some dim sum, and other kinds of food -- they all varied in excellence. There are unusual foods which I have not seen at other buffets before, one of them being pork belly fat wrapped inside a flour bun. Nonetheless, the food was presented beautifully, just like the decor around the buffet (curly-glass chandeliers and beautiful silverware). The dessert selection was amazing, and it's not like any other dessert selection you see at other buffets. There were macaroons, chocolate slates, mini chocolate-covered apples (each is unique with different toppings), gelato, unusual tarts sitting in egg shells, and chocolate covered strawberries. You can tell that they put a lot of effort into individually making each piece of dessert.\n\nThe Bad: My number one complaint here would be the staff. Although friendly as they were, they were not prepared as they should be, both in terms of handling food AND as waiters. Our waiter approached our table saying, \"My name is uh, ____. *Long pause* I am going to be your server today.\" It seemed pretty obvious he was trying to remember his lines, which should have been perfected before the grand opening of such a high-class casino. Not only that, but he DISAPPEARED after giving us our drinks and NEVER CAME BACK to check up on us or refill our drinks. Our glasses were empty after a while and we had to call on a random staff to refill it for us. As we were eating, we heard a big clash near the kitchen door and found that the same staff member just dropped the tray with our drinks on it. Another clash was heard later on, for another staff had dropped another tray on the floor. Our finished plates literally filled up the entire table before the staff took it away. Also, the place lacked fruits, which I think is essential at a buffet.\n\nOverall: I feel that this buffet has so much potential, but just lacks the proper staffing experience and some food quality/selection at the moment. If you're reading this review in the future, hopefully the staff will be more prepared and the food choices will open up just a little by then. I am a little bit curious myself to see much they will improve in a few months' time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

For 27 bucks for dinner, one of the cheaper gourmet buffet options on the Strip. \n\nWicked Spoon's concept is a buffet tapas thing - everything in small portions on small plates. Unfortunately, there are several problems: one, the stations aren't very clearly labeled. So you have to wander around a bit to figure out the layout and there are a couple of stations I didn't really get. (I THINK it's a make-your-own-Thai-rice-noodle-soup station at the end of the Asian portion.)\n\nThe second problem is that any time you plate several small plates on top of a larger one, they start to slide around as you walk. And it made for stacking the dirty dishes difficult for the waitstaff. Who, coincidentally, are not super amazing at their jobs. I can't IMAGINE what the dishwashing looks like behind the scenes.\n\nOverall, there was a wide range of food options. I enjoyed an udon noodle stirfry, some Korean riblets, and the little shrimp cocktails. Lamb chops in olives and artichoke hearts was a stand out, if they could get some more olive flavor into the meat. We also uniformly enjoyed the sausage in balsamic grilled grapes. (Okay, not exactly sure what this was, wish I'd taken better notes. Sorry Yelp.)\n\nI see that other Yelpers have given the Asian section bad reviews but I honestly thought it was one of the better Asian sections on a buffet in town. Less focus on sushi, and more on regional foods that don't always show up on a buffet line. (Probably because middle America is just getting around to trying it.)\n\nWe didn't like the already-lumped crab. It was chewy and overdone and we all commented that we preferred the mess of shelling it because it usually tasted better. Other misses: lamb ragu with gnocchi. Saffron cod barely tasted saffrony. \n\nDessert was eh, but we didn't have any of the gelato. I did like that they had a bowl of mixed berries - should have stuck to this, a bit of fresh cheese and bread off the salad line and gone with a European dessert. The cheese selection is quite nice for a buffet in this price range.\n\nI hate to feel so mixed. I'm sure management will dumb this place down soon, so go experience it for yourself before they do.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

The gourmet food was so good that we went back a second time. We would have gone back for Breakfast had our schedule allowed it. Our first meal was on Wednesday at 1pm. The place was not crowded at all. There was a great selection of food. Everything was delicious. \n\nOthers have spoken about the \"individual serving\" sizes being too small. Well you can take as many as you want or go back for more, so I don't see their argument. One point that I would make, however, is that if you just want to taste the ricotta cream spinach or the red wine braised mushrooms you HAVE to take a full serving. Our next meal was on Thursday at 7pm. Again it was not crowded. The selection was very similar to the previous lunch with a few added selections. The spicy crab meat was not overcooked but we did notice some small shell pieces in it.    \n\nThe restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Resort & Casino all the way back in the West End Tower. We easily walked from the Monte Carlo. Taking the crosswalk from City Center over Harmon Ave allows you to enter the resort by the chandelier. If you want to ride the tram, I would say it is just about the same distance from the tram station at the Bellagio as it is from the one at Crystals.

This place feels so fancy-schmancy in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, but you aren't really paying all that much more for great food and beautiful presentation.  For Sunday Brunch, we came here with a party of 7 - It was $23 for Brunch and $30 for Brunch with unlimited Champagne.  I am sure that it is cheaper during the weekdays.  With all the drinking and eating that we've been doing, we decided that it was best to forgo the unlimited Champagne.  \n\nHaving heard that this place just opened nearly a month ago, I was super impressed with their food and the number of patrons.  This place was not easy to find.  The drinks here are massive!  My cup of coffee was the same size as their huge orange juice cups!  Even though it is not unlimited, everyone still got a glass of Champagne as a part of their Sunday Brunch.  I love their portions of food.  I love that the desserts are serves in cute little metal cups - Excellent presentation and choice!  It is nice to know that the food has been untouched by someone else!  Bonus points!\n\nThe dessert section was awesome!  I highly recommend their coffee Gelato Ice cream (There are bits of nuts and toffee in there! MmMm), Strawberry dipped Chocolate (There are toffee in the chocolate and rice crispy covered in white chocolate! mMmMm), and the list can go on and on.  I actually don't recommend their caramel/chocolate dipped mini red apples, but that may be a personal bias as I believe in green apples and white chocolate!  Did I mention that they had fresh Dragon Fruit? MmMm!\n\nBeautiful experience here.  I definitely want to return for their dinner buffet the next time I am in Vegas!

They make it upscale, but it's not all that.  There's no flavor at all.  You have tourists, which have lost all there $$ on Gambling.  They feel they should recuperate there losses with eating all the food they can.  They make the portions very small, in little plates (tapas style), but you can only fill 4 items on your plate.  That's a lot of dishes to work with.\n\n\nWell, since I lost so much $, i wanted to eat so I can have some energy to play again.  \n\n1.  SERVICE: Our waiter was not to be seen.  We had to flag down a Manager after 20 mins of dehydration,  once we spoke with the manager, we had prompt response with our drinks, with 2 other waiters.  We still didn't see our waiter for another 30 mins.  Once we did, we actually had to ask for sugar because there was none available for our Ice Coffee and Ice Tea.\n\n2.  PHO STATION: The Soup was not hot and they place the Greens under a food hot lamp.  All the greens were wilted.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??\n\n3.  LABELS:  Most of the dishes have no labels.  You pretty much have to guess what the dish is.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  I thought this salad was with taro, but it wasn't.  I had no idea what that stuff was?  Even their soups, you had to guess.  There were 2 choices of soup, Pho Base or Miso Soup.  of course, they don't label it.  I betcha most of the \"WHITE\" people put the miso soup with the Pho Rice noodles.  that's a major faux-pau in the culinary industry.  Just my opinion.\n\n\n4.  DESERT BAR:  Again, they have no labels next to the items, so you have to guess what the heck it is.  You had to flag down someone behind the bar in order for them to hand you a desert behind the display case.  They should leave that out, if you have to wait there for 5 mins to get a desert.\n\nThey had this Egg custard , in an Egg shell, that Tone recommended, which had different layers of flavors.  I was so intrigued.  So I got one.  But to my dismay, it was just soup.  It was a creamy shot of Blah.. he said it was not made right, since the first time it was made.  it was suppose to be layers, but they did not let the layers set.\n\n5.  RESTROOMS:  They have a very very small restroom for the Buffet.  only 4 people can fit in the bathroom at 1 time.  When I was there, only 1 urinal was available.  so a max of 3 people can be in at one time.  This is okay, but after i finished my meal, the Desert Egg Shell Custard shot did not agree with me.  \n\nAt least I can recommend the Egg custard as a Laxative.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

We got there at right at 5pm with no wait, and the cost was only $27 for dinner. Affordable pricing for such an upscale looking buffet.\n\nI loved how all the food was laid out and there were individual platings of all the sides in cute mini plates or pots. Definitely an A+ for looks. Too bad the taste fell way short.\n\nAt first, I though that it was pretty tasty, but alas I was just too damn starving and distracted by the pretty plates to notice. But after my first plate, I noticed that nothing really stood out. I had no favorites to go back to...and I just ended up trying a little bit of everything. Which is almost IMPOSSIBLE to do.\n\nRemember those cute individual platings? TERRIBLE IDEA! Sometimes I would only want a bite or two, but because I had to take the entire serving, I ended up with a stack of lil plates and pots on my table. I felt super wasteful, but couldn't bear to eat the entire serving because I didn't like it all that much. \n\nPlus those small serving plates avoid you from piling on different things at the buffet creating more than necessary trips back and forth. By then, you just end up getting full before you can get your money's worth. Boo!\n\nThe meats were a little dry, and WHAT...no crab legs?? Instead they had some kinda peeled crab (I THINK) in some butter sauce. Of course I wouldn't really know because nothing is LABELED. But regardless, it was rubbery and weird and tasteless. My favorite thing was the shrimp cocktail, juicy and plump...but it was served in tiny plates of 2 shrimp apiece :\\ Whyyyyyyyyy is life so difficult??\n\nMy favorite part of buffets is always the dessert bar. Again, everything here looks stunning. Miniature works of art. Although looking individual and unique, many of their dessert were similar in form...custard base with a fruit gel. Nothing spectacular. They also have chocolate covered strawberries which I liked, but my favorite was the gelato. The salted peanut flavor was my top pick.\n\nService was also on the slow side. It took the waiter 30 minutes before my coffee came out.

It was delicious!! Husband doesn't eat much salad...but came back with a plate full of different salads. The asian section of the buffet had some pretty good entrees.  And the dessert selection was pretty vast.  The chocolate covered strawberries, the fudge, cookies, and of course, there was a gelato bar that a buffet can't be without. \n\nThe cons:  Some of the dishes had no placards so you didn't really know what it was that you were getting.  The fish dishes were overcooked. The ham hock mac n cheese...the mac was completely undercooked, it tasted like raw dough! It was disgusting! \n\nBottom line: Maybe they need more time.. i would go back again to give it a second chance!", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Definitely on par with the food at the M buffet. Plus, I didn't have to waste my time getting messy trying to get the crab out of the shell, because it was already done for me. Something, I haven' found at any other buffet.  Also, unlike the M, the wait to get in isn't 3 to 4 hours.\n\nThey also offer a lot of desserts that other buffets don't. Chocolate covered strawberries. Chocolate covered apples [but I wish they were caramel covered]. Crepes. Peanut butter & jelly gelato. Salted peanut gelato. Cute litle mini chocolate cones filled with pudding.  \n\nOn the other hand, the thing I hate most about this place [seems to be the  thing most people love about this place], is the fact that most dishes are served on individual plates or little pots. In most buffets, only the desserts such as cake or pie are served on individual platters. \n\nWhy do I hate this? Simply put - I can't fit as much on my plate. When I go to buffets - my plan of action is to usually get a little bit of a lot of food to kind of feel the place out. Which is, definitely something I couldn't do here. You can only grab about 3 small plates at a time. Which means you have to get up from your table more often. I guess, this could be construed as a good thing - as it provides a little more exercise to negate some of the thousands of calories you will have consumed by the end of the meal. BUT, I like to chill at the table with whomever else I am with and enjoy my food - without having to pause the conversation to get up and get more food every five minutes. \n\nLastly, I've gotten used to the free, unlimited beer/wine/cider offered at the M. So, I was disappointed by the fact that this buffet did not offer the same. But, that could just be me being spoiled. =p\n\nSo, like I said - definitely a love/hate relationship. But, I think it's leaning more towards the hate side. \n\nWould I go back? Probably. Would I rather go to the M? Probably.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

I wasn't in the mood for an omelette, so everything was out of my control.\n\nThe shrimp and crab fingers - served in pairs already in sauce...yuk.  Almost every dish I could find, labeled or not, had pork in it, except carving station stuff.  Pasta, shrimp dishes, creamed corn, you name it, it was pork-infested.  With limited options, I didn't enjoy much except the make-your-own noodle bowl station at the end of the buffet.\n\nThe desserts were worse - nothing was labeled except the gelato.  I didn't know what the hot pink goo was or the purple fudge looking stuff was, so I didn't get any of that.  I asked Will why the food wasn't labeled.  He said lots of people ask him that, that the management is aware, but that the \"signage is delayed on order.\"  I would hope the Cosmo has its own printer.  Oh well.

What I also thought was pretty cool is that they serve most of the food in these individual trays. So, you don't scoop it into your plate. Although this is cool, it definitely doesn't allow you to take a lot of food back to your table in one plate.\n\nSo, why the 2 stars? Cuz the food was disappointing. It was mostly pastas. No roast beef or prime rib, or crab legs. You would think one of these would at least be on the menu if you're paying $19.

He tried the salads and he wasn't happy with that either. \n\nI was like \"Go back up there and try to find something\" While I'm stuffing my face with Kalbi. Yum...Kalbi good! They also had some pretty succulent lamb. I tasted the Crab in butter sauce but I didn't like it . They do make awesome Truffled Mashed Potatoes and the Brussell Sprouts with bacon were delicious. I don't know if it's the heavy sauces and creams that they use but you get full pretty quickly. I was disappointed about that and the fact that I could have taken my husband to the Palace Station Buffet and he would have been happier! \n\nThe dessert was okay but some of it isn't edible it's just for looks. Like the Pink Cheeto looking things were just shaped sugar with no taste. I was only happy with the Chocolate Covered Strawberries. I know they want their food to look stylish but I think it should also taste good! I don't thinks it's impossible ...The Palms used to have these very cute mini pastries that looked cool and were very tasty! \n\nThe food may make you feel bloated and tired.

It was dry and rubbery. Sushi was alright too,  i liked how they had the sushi chef making the sushi right next to that station.  Thumbs up for having a mac and cheese station..  AMAZING!  I would say the best items were the pastas and salads.  The deserts were pretty, but tasted okay.  \n\nThe second visit to the buffet was a lot better.  We paid $23 on Saturday for brunch.  Ahhh breakfast foods.. So delish. To die for hash browns, to die for chicken sausage, to die for Guinness pancakes.. yup i said that Guinness pancakes. YUMMMY! Everything on Saturday was fresh and tasty.  The selection was almost identical to dinner minus the breakfast items and lack of crab.\n\nOverall, I think this is one of the better buffets on the strip.  Although it sucks waiting in line.

O...M...G...unlimited chocolate covered strawberries!!! Gelato galore! So many treats to eat...ohhh it was incredible!\n\nThis is an outstanding buffet. However, solely based on food, this is a 4-star buffet. But...we had an incredible server...Josie! In fact, she is the best server I have ever had at ANY buffet!

Drink refills can be a little slow because they bring you a whole new cup/glass instead of doing refills.

Since this is new, i wanted to try it so bad and it was definitely a great decision! This place is inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's new, it looks very nice and you can tell that they do try to make things very eye-catchy and food at high quality. \n\ni think the most important part of the buffet is the dessert section..to me at least! The dessert section here is amazing, well, compare to wynn and bellagio, they're similar, It's nothing more or special that makes them more superior but it's good enough that i ate till my stomach was about to explode! \n\nThey have almost everything that u can imagine at a buffet here. The best part was of cox the dessert station with all kinds of chocolate barks, chocolate dipped strawberries, YUM!, chocolate dipped mini apples, cakes, tarts, etc. They also have a wide range of gelato flavors, from the simple chocolate to buttered rum. They serve it to you in a cup or a mini cone, your choice, they even have a chocolate waffle cone for you to choose from. Amazing! \n\nAnother thing that's a must try is the mac and cheese station, i fell in love with it and got another round of it even though i was completely full. You basically go there and tell him wat you want in your mac and cheese, you choose ur own cheese (blue, ricotta, or cheddar), type of mac, toppings (lobster, crab, onions, sausage, etc), yum! Other things that i would eat there are the prime ribs, shrimp, salad, this seared salmon with some kind of sauce, forgot the name of it, but it was good! \n\nI just can't think of cons of this place so far. I would definitely go back there again. Oh maybe one of the cons is that the servers are not too bright, we were constantly getting some drinks that we didn't order that was probably from another table, and getting refills for a drink that's not even half empty yet, but not getting refills for a drink that was empty 30 mins ago.

I had the Mac & bleu cheese--yum and the wild rice with lamb and goat cheese.  \n\nThe carving stations.  yes multiple.  I could dive head first into the Asian style bbq pork.  It was melt in your mouth.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and made suggestions of what were their favorites.  \n\nI have to say, as I'm writing this realizing the best part of the 2x we've been there, was the staff.  I do like the food selections and the twist with the portioned servings... also made me exercise to walk back up and get another serving... knowing it was 220 calories each.  \n\nI did save room for dessert, a wide selection indeed.  Rice Crispy treats dipped in chocolate? yummo.  \n\nLiving in Vegas, it is only for out of town guests and work that I go anywhere near the strip but last week, with no company and no clients, we opted to actually go to the Wicked Spoon for lunch.  If nothing else, for a Vegas local, that says a lot.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

This might account for the 4 star rating, but I'm sticking with it. Haha.\n\nWe came in on a Thursday about 8:45. Not the busiest time of the week, so service was pretty attentive as opposed to the complaints about plates stacking up at the table for long periods of time and drinks going unfilled. I didn't run into any of these problems. This is a new hotel, so obviously there is a grace period where staff has to work out a lot of their kinks, so this could count account for the slower service in the past. \n\nI do agree with many of Yelpers about the tapas style servings being a total waste. I'm sure they'll probably get rid of that concept eventually. It's just too difficult to try to balance lots of tiny little plates on one large plate and yes, many of the food items like pasta and potatoes became dry and lost their flavor and textural interest. I stuck with the kalbi, red wine mushrooms and crab cocktail. They have a lot of variety and I appreciated a lot of the interesting food options they attempted, even though they didn't always hit the mark perfectly at least they took the chance and I admire that.\n\nThe desserts are yummy. I can never get enough chocolate covered strawberries, French macaroons or gelato. Stay away from the chocolate covered crabapples. They're pretty than they taste. \n\nI have faith this buffet will hit a groove at some point and I think it is definitely a good option for AYCE on the strip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

As we walked up to the desk, they were having a lot of issues with the register and for some reason couldn't scan our credit card, obviously the girl was new, but we were all so hungry and a bit irritated.  Finally we were seated and we rushed to the food line.  \n\nI must say their presentation is like dining at a French restaurant, everything is portioned out and so well presented.  I first walked down their cheese and bread aisle, I took a little bit of everything and I was a bit disappointed.  I love bread and there's not a lot of bread i hate, but everything tasted hard and stale.  Not my cup of tea, so I went back and took a little bit of everything else.  I tried their mushroom in a red wine reduction, that I enjoyed, then I had some of their salmon, didn't like the taste of it, I got some Kalbi, the meat was super salty, the pho noodles were terrible, it tasted like chicken broth and noodles.  The lobster was also very tough and not tasty at all. The only hot food dish i enjoyed was their Shrimp, now that was really good.  It was a spicy salt and pepper seasoning and i went back for more of that, other than that I just went back once for everything else, and I normally do not do that.\n\nSo after i finished i thought the dessert never lets me down, so I walk over there and they had little milk and white chocolate dipped gala apples on a stick, bars of chocolate, different parfaits and cakes and also gelato.  The apples were terrible, they were very soft and mushy, tasted like they were bruised, the bars of chocolate was good, the parfaits combined too many random flavors together, the only thing I enjoyed and glad they didn't go wrong was the pistachio gelato.  \n\nOther than the shrimp and gelato, I definitely wouldn't go back again, unless the day I went the chef was just having a bad day.

It was a strange brown ginghamy, wrinkled, shirt-dress type deal that was not at all flattering. \nThe breakfast spread was cool, with small individual servings of items like 3 kinds of benedicts, smoothies, yogurt parfaits. The presentation was about the only great thing about this place. The benedicts, though made in small batches, had hard biscuits at the base, dry tough ham and sauces that quickly congealed making them very unappetizing. Hubby and I were unable to eat our respective benedicts. They had red velvet pancakes.... Babycakes don't even break a sweat... they were just dried up red colored pancakes with dried cream cheese drizzled on. The omelet station had some great fresh looking savory fillings but the avocado topping they placed on mine had a weird tangy taste that ruined it for me! \nWait staff was nice enough but slow, took their time clearing plates and refilling water They serve you water in these glass bottles. I'm sure they refill them but at least you have access to water while they take their time working the room! \n\nThe plu$$es: \nGreat breads especially their tangy sourdough! \nGood granola \nWalnut French Toast \nOmelet Station - just no avocado pleeze! \nIndividual cereal boxes... some good kinds not just Raisin Bran! \n\n$15 dollars for a weekday breakfast.. not so bad.

They have a smaller variety...but when you get something it usually is pretty good.  Less variety with great quality.\n\nIt's an interesting experience.

The bone marrow roast and the lamb had me sold.  The Guinness pancakes were just the kicker.  It was ON!\n\nHowever, we went for Saturday brunch and neither the lamb nor the marrow were available at that hour and the guy behind the counter said that they don't do Guinness pancakes.  I was crushed.\n\nThat said, the food there was just fine, it just wasn't what I had hoped.  The variety of foods was impressive but I have to say that the selection within each food genre seemed kinda slim.  My favorite dishes were the prime rib-y thing and the kielbasa.\n\nFor dessert, as others have mentioned, look good, but there were no signs to suggest what each item is.  I was mighty full by the time I hit the dessert bar so, while I was quite impressed with the presentations, I statyed away fro most of ht pretty looking unknown treats.  I got a plate of berries and lemon gelato which was just light enough for my dessert.\n\nI have to also mention that I got the bottomless mimosas with the meal.  I had two mimosas and then moved to bloody Marys.  The bloody Marys were much better than the mimosas.\n\nThe ambiance was much nicer than those of the Rio World Buffet or the M Resort's Studio B buffet, but I have to say that I preferred the food at both the Rio and the M over Cosmo's Wicked Spoon.\n\nOne final note.  We had a large group, 16 people.  The manager was kind enough to allow two of us to line up while the rest of our group gathered (most of us had a late night).  After the pair reached the front of the line they gave us 15 minutes to gather our group and then they let us all right in, reserving a pair of cashiers to let us all pay individually.  After seating us, the initial response from our waitress seemed kind of annoyed and b*tchy, but after we figured everything out (drink orders and what not) the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  I can't say I blame them for being initially annoyed at the confusion.\n\nIt was a good experience, and the food was good.  But I would be sure to check the food list before coming in, and honestly, I think I'm more inclined to check out some of the other buffets or returning to Studio B before coming back to Wicked Spoon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Dined here about 7:15p on a Thursday. $27 for dinner, so about $29 with tax. Very friendly service. Got seated right by the entrance so everyone coming in can see us, but whatever. We were waiting for a friend anyways so this made it easy for him to find us.\n\nNicely decorated and not too large of a dining area. So it's easy to get around. Start at the left with appetizers and salads, and work your way to the right, ending you with a vast array of fudge and other decadent sweets.\n\nIt is very nice that most of the items are individually portioned. But even with the small portions, I didn't actually finish any of the dishes because I wanted to make sure I could try everything. And the crab claws already opened and in little saucers with cocktail sauce, nice touch! The salads were fantastic. The breads, not that great. The kobe beef shoulder, yum! Also the truffle scalloped potato, delicious! There was a select few items I did not care for, but I don't even remember it. I read notes that someone mentioned the braised short ribs and they were as expected, tender and flavorful!\n\nI didn't try much from the pizza/pasta or asian section. I had to save room for desserts!\n\nI loved their selection for ice cream. I tried the coconut lime and the pb&j. Both were yummy with a little tiny cone I used as a scooper :)\n\nAlso note the amazing quantity of large chocolate covered strawberries, some plain, some white chocolate, some with nuts, some with oreos, etc. Also mini chocolate dipped apples! YUMMY!\n\nAnd then there were crepes, which I didn't get a chance to try. Cookies there were really good. Strongly alcoholic tiramisu cups. Other sweets that were too sweet. Overall, though great place with a nice selection. A close second to Wynn Buffet IMO, but for the price, I might come here more often.\n\nOur server, I can't remember her name, but she was very sweet and everyone worked together to make sure we had enough room on our table for new plates as we eat very quickly and create a ton a dishes. Good job.\n\nOne thing, The buffet is such a long walk from the rest of the restaurants. If you go up the escalator/elevator by the chandelier, you gotta walk through a long hallway passing by 2 large high heel shoes and another quiet hall to finally reach the buffet at the end. But note: if you are only coming for the buffet, park at the west elevator and take that escalator up that is right by there instead of walking all the way through the casino and back around upstairs. ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Yes this buffet may not have sashimi or lot of seafood such as crab leg, this hotel has variety, innovation, and something different.  They have the traditional salad and meat stations but they have other new offerings that other buffets don't have such as...bone marrow, pork belly bun, pork belly fried rice, dashi broth, truffle potato gratin, smelt fries, tiny ice cream cones, and much more.  The presentations of each dish were very well done.  Some dishes had their own little pot or own little plate however this did become an issue when it was time to put food on your plate (spacing).  The desserts were a bit weak even though the colors made it very tempting.  For example, macaron's quality/texture was what made it bad.  The shell was too crunchy where if you put some force on it, it would just crumble.  \n\nThe service and decor were both great.

Stopped here for a Saturday lunch around 12:30pm and there was no line! We had a large party of 18 so we had to wait for everyone to get charged and we were seated within 10 minutes.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and was beautifully decorated, especially for a buffet, but I guess we were at Cosmopolitan where the decor itself in the hotel and casino areas were extravagant.  I thought they had more of a selection but they didn't seem to have as many different items as the Carnival Buffet. However the quality and look of the food at the Wicked Spoon does belong on another level. They serve their water in these fancy glass bottles firstly. They have a nice bread bar/salad bar where the salads are already made and dressed and ready to get picked up in small cute modern looking dishware. The Wicked Spoon is all about presentation and art. It is a unique buffet but it looks better than it tastes. \n\nThey had a nice omelette making station here it allows you to customize your own, and even offer the option of egg whites and smoked salmon which most other places don't have. The Miso Shrimp salad is tasty and refreshing, and I loved the Mac & Cheese! Its served in a cute silver measuring cup and the top is baked so its crispy and cheesy..yum!\n\nThe highlight was definitely the Dessert Bar. Everything just looked so beautiful and colorful, I was really excited to try a lot of it. Macarons let me down, they were dry and tasted weird. The Panna Cotta was probably the only thing I really enjoyed and Chocolate Dipped Strawberries! OH, and they have an awesome Gelato selection! I believe about 14 different flavors to try :) For $26 its comparable to most other buffets but looks a lot better so I'd probably still come back! Dinner is only $1 more, at $27.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Great variety as you get all kinds of cuisine, American, Italian, Asian, Mexican etc etc. I really have to rave about their dessert, make sure you save room for these because they are what makes this buffet a step above the other Vegas buffets in my opinion. First of all, it's huge, even bigger than Wynn's dessert bar. Second, everything is SO CUTE! Hence making everything look even more appetizing. The dessert come in small portions and the plus side of that is you get to try a variety of their delicious desserts instead of getting full from one big slice of chocolate fudge pie. Nothing is too sweet so you get to enjoy other flavors and textures of their dessert such as the sourness in the mango gelato, fluffiness of coconut puree, and the richness of the chocolate of the chocolate-covered gigantic strawberry.

Pork belly fried rice, pad thai, beef and broccoli (the broccollini not the regular broccoli)house special sushi rolls, and duck were just a FEW of the Asian cuisine.

The macaroni and cheese..why was is so special? It was cooked with hamhocks...You want smoked salmon with cream cheese on a bagel? Well buddy, they had pastrami smoked salmon..get that...Red velvet pancakes, mini white and dark chocolate covered apples, ginormous chocolate covered strawberries, italian gelato that was to die for...... I could go on and on and on...just go try it for yourself..you won't be disappointed. You will be a little happy camper like I was..literally...we camped it there for 3 hours trying to savor EVERYTHING..gluttony at it's finest!

It isn't my favorite way to dine, but this is Vegas, so I thought I should give it another try and I had been hearing a lot of good about this one in particular.\n\nWe went for brunch on Sunday, I think it was around $23 a person without alcohol.  I like the design of the buffet.  Everything was spaced enough that there was easy access to any section without a line, even though the place looked fairly full.  \n\nThe service was pretty awful.  I was done with my first plate before our server even brought our coffee.  When we ordered, we told him we took cream and sugar, yet there were only three packets of sugar in the caddy he brought.  I asked for more before he even stepped away, yet he went on to do other things before getting us more sugar.  His station was only one table away from ours, so I was tempted to just get it myself.  \n\nThere was a nice variety of food available, but I couldn't help but think buffets are really for people that just care about quantity.  There wasn't one dish that stood out as being very good.  I especially love breakfast pastries and that should be one thing that would be easy to do well on a buffet.  However, the croissants looked so awful I didn't even take one.  The pain aux raisins and muffins were mediocre while the desserts were downright awful.  \n\nI did enjoy some french toast and their house-smoked sausage was good.  But the short rib pasta was over salted and their sushi was a little soggy.\n\nOverall I could have taken that $23 over to Bouchon's for a fabulous, fresh breakfast and far better service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

BTW, it wasn't very busy but perhaps its the fact that the COSMO is still a pretty new hotel and maybe no one knew about the buffet? Nice though since we didn't have to wait long on a Sunday evening.\n\nNow this isn't my favorite Vegas buffet but I just enjoyed it because it was different and unique. It was nice and clean and the food was presented in these cool, plates, small pans, and were portioned controlled. Everything tasted good, but the one thing that stood out was the crab in cajun butter. I am just salivating thinking about it right now as I type. Yes, seafood is a must have for any Asian person at a Vegas buffet. Check my pics, pretty awesome huh?\n\nOverall, I give a solid 5 stars. The atmosphere was great, and our server was amazing and friendly. We practically chatted it up with her, and she was nice enough to give us tips on where the hot spots were and what places to hit up (even on a Sunday). She was amaze! Food was delicious, clean, and presented well. You can't go wrong with checking out the Wicked Spoon. But if your lazy about going up a lot, you might not like it as the plates are small and everything on the buffet line is in a separate pan or mini plates, so be advised that your plate fills up quickly. But you should definitely check it out if you don't mind that. :-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

The price was 36 bucks with tip and tax included for our  8 person party.  From what I hear that's a good deal for dinner buffets in Vegas so I was pleased with that as well. We were seated at this nice long high top table that had interesting blue glass art hanging over our heads.  \n\nWhile some aren't a fan of the pre-portioned plates and pots they serve their food in, I kind of love the idea.  It kinda lets you think you're almost eating tapa style dishes rather than a buffet. Now dining was the fun part- I literally tasted everything from the different sections - my favorite was probably the pastas.  \n\nI barely had room for dessert but forced myself regardless. They have this cute little gelato bar so of course I got mango gelato.  Their desserts were overall very pretty but unique looking. The most normal thing they had was chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nThis is kind of weird too but I just loved the water they served.  It was from these glass bottles that remind you of the old school milk bottles that were dropped at your door.  It just tasted so refreshing.

My stay at the Cosmopolitan included a $50 breakfast credit to be used at my choice of The Henry, Coffee Beanery place, or Wicket Spoon.  I woke up hung over so I wandered down to the buffet.\n\nNow, I don't have a whole lot of buffet experience to compare it to.  I've only been to the Plaza's buffet for breakfast years and years ago before I moved here and knew better, Makino Sushi/Seafood at the Premium Outlets, and the MGM Grand Buffet for lunch (it was comp otherwise to this day I most likely would still have never been to it).  I left Wicket Spoon stuffed, because I felt the need to try a bit of everything.  \n\nThe following is what I remember having:\n- Seared whitefish eggs benedict\n  *** This was AMAZING - MUST TRY!!!\n- Margharita flatbread\n- Red velvet pancake\n  *** Very disappointing.\n- Pecan sticky bun\n  ***  I don't usually eat crap like this, but this was bomb.\n- Home fries\n- Hash browns\n  *** Topped w/cheddar cheese and carmelized onions, which is a plus, but the taters themselves could've been crispier. \n- Some type of crepe\n- Some type of french toast on sterioids: it was super super thick, had cinnamon, pecans and a think syrup which reminded me almost of caramel sauce.\n  *** Pretty yummy, and unhealthy!\n\nSide note: they do not have peanut butter!  This is a big no-no for breakfast lovers such as myself, as I eat it every morning!\n\nI believe I tried a few other things but can't remember exactly what.  But...seared whitefish eggs benny...oh, how I adore you.  \n\nI don't eat land-roving meat (only fish/seafood) so I didn't try any of the sausage, bacon or meat related items.  Some of the other things I noticed but did not try were made to order omlettes, smoked salmon, various cereals & yogurts, waffles, one or two more selections of flatbreads, fresh fruit, etc.  So, overall there was a good selection to choose from, however I was expecting it to be a bit bigger in size (but maybe that's my buffet inexperience showing).  \n\nA lot of items, as you will read from other Yelp reviews, are portioned out into individual serving dishes.  This is a neat, unique concept.  The only downfall I found was it made it a tad difficult to gather multiple items in one trip.  Maybe that's what they're going for, so people ultimately eat less...I don't know.  What I do know is I must've looked like a pig with all the individual dishes on my table!!!\n\nService was great.  Upon entering and exiting the buffet, the hostesses were very warm, welcoming, and greeted with a smile.  The server was attentive and also very friendly.  Like I said, I'm not big on buffets but if I were to go back to one for lunch or dinner, it would most likely be Wicket Spoon.  If you're a buffet person, you should definitely put this one on your list.  Happy eating!", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Am I glad I did! \n\nThe food was fresh, fun, and really delicious. I really enjoyed the arugula salad (yes, I got salad in a buffet), the crab claws, and the bread. \nWorking my way through the buffet, the highlights were the pork belly sliders, braised short ribs, prime rib, and the Mac and cheese bar. \n\nYes, I said Mac and cheese bar. You pick what you want, and they whip up a b\u00e9chamel infused bowl of goodness that will make you rethink buffets for the rest of your life. Jacob whipped me up a  bowl of Lobster Mac and cheese that was so heavenly. \n\nI am not a huge dessert person, but I really loved them. The macarons were tasty and the salted peanut gelato was awesome. I also had an oatmeal cookie, which truth be told, I wish I had three of right now. \n\nThe service was a bit slow, I thought. \n\nOverall, though, just like the rest of The Cosmopolitan, it sets the bar higher for the next hotel to beat.

Many dishes came in baby pots, chinese to-go boxes, etc. It's a way to win an \"awwww\" with girls.. but with me? I don't really care. It's cute, but my money goes to taste not necessarily presentation. I tried a little bit of everything, but the salad bar (waste of stomach space).

The creamed corn was okay. \n\nTheir dessert selection was probably the highlight of the buffet. Yes, they were presented in a very \"cute\" way, but I didn't care for most of it. Chocolate covered long-stem strawberries, french macarons (they only had two flavors and they didn't look/taste very appealing). I do, however, like that they had a variety of gelato flavors. \n\nI think at the time when I was there, I thought it was amazing because I was in awe of how the Cosmopolitan looked and their presentation, but thinking now.. I probably wouldn't go back. Their food selection wasn't all that great. I think they try to mask their lack of food selection with all that jazzed up stuff (cute trays, baby pots, tiny wrapped food, etc). \n\nCrazy price for a just an \"okay\" buffet.

Now, onto the main courses (of which I had many of):\n\n-Mac & Cheese: Comfort food is so necessary after a night of vegas debauchery, so this sure hit the spot.  They are served in small individual tin pots which helps with portion control. In my case, there is no such thing as self or portion control so I had myself some seconds and thirds. No regrets, they were THAT good. Cheesy, oozing goodness.\n\n-White Whipped Ricotta Pizza: Easily became my second favorite dish as it paired so well with their garlic bread. Thin crusted, the ricotta simply made this dish the \"10\" rating it deserved.\n\n-Breakfast: Red velvet pancakes w/ homemade cream cheese sauce & bacon. Yes, I ate breakfast at 1:30 P.M. and enjoyed every bite of it. \n\n-Asian section: Pork belly fried rice, pork buns, Miso glazed pork (see pictures). Divine. Lots of pork so if you're not a lover, steer yourself in another direction.\n\n-Dessert: Biscotti ice cream, white chocolate covered mini-apples and strawberries. Scrumptious. One of the only buffets in vegas that showcases lots of white chocolate, which I prefer over chocolate, any day. The white choco strawberries had an Oreo crumb crust, definitely a winner. Had seconds of the Biscotti ice cream which came with mini-waffle bowls & cones. So aesthetically pleasing! They also have lots of other ice cream flavors to choose from - all fresh and homemade I believe.\n\n$26 brunch, $29 dinner on a Saturday.\n\n\nWicked Spoon displays lots of entrees that you will not find anywhere else.

You can't fit that many food items on one plate and for people who know what they like and want more of it, they are forced to get multiple pots just to get the portion they want.

Telling me I had to try it.  So in the middle of our clubbing session at Marquee we left the club to go get some pizza.  This place is hidden on the second floor in between Blue Ribbon Sushi + Jaleo.  It's hidden, if you were just walking by, you'd never know it was a pizza joint down that long hallway.  Once you reach the end of the hallway you go into this little area with a Galactica (is that how you spell it?) arcade game and a pinball machine.  The minute we walked in we were greeted by the pizza maker, Nico.  He was very personable and explained what would make a good slice.  We start off with a basic cheese slice, a pepperoni slice or a white slice and make \"magic\" at the end.  We told him to surprise us so he made us a white pizza w/ roasted tomatoes and basil + garlic.  Second slice was meatball w/ green peppers.  This is the BEST pizza I have ever had.  I used to love Rocco's pizza in Summerlin, but now that I've tasted this, it is ultimately the best pizza.  The price is very reasonable.  It's $3.00 and $0.50 per topping.   This is a great go to place after clubbing.  It's hard to explain how good this pizza is.  I'm not a big pizza eater, but this place makes me want to eat a whole pie.  Definitely worth a try if you're ever at the Cosmo.  Remember, it's on the second floor in between Blule Ribbon Sushi + Jaleo.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eq6lQI039SBLC6sHm3idGA"}

NY style pizza? with how much I have been missing my home lately I needed to get my crack pizza fix. After walking all around, hunting, and putting my super pizza senses to work my friend and I found this place. 3rd floor. hidden back with a walk along vintage album covers. I am giving it a star for all the top secret pizza business going on, but to be honest I was let down with the pizza. The employees were eh and after waiting and looking at each other for a few minutes they asked if we needed any help. I ordered the margarita pizza while my friend just had the cheese. It was thin like nyc, but very hard. I had to work to fold my pizza. (yes, i am a folder. stop judging me las vegas.) i'm use to my pizza being so hot that it burns the roof of my mouth leaving me with a reminder for days of that glorious pizza i consumed days before. This one was warm but not hot. It lacked a certain flavor, but I couldn't put my finger on what. My friend said his basic cheese slice tasted no different then sbarro's, I was mad at myself for paying 4 bucks for this slice, but what can ya do?\nthe hunt was fun and maybe this would be good pizza after an evening of drinking inside the cosmo, but coming from a new yorker this is not new york style pizza.\nsorry super secret pizzeria, but you didn't win over my heart.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eq6lQI039SBLC6sHm3idGA"}

That hallway will lead you to a pinball machine and voil\u00e0!, you've found your pot of gold. \n\nStaying at the Cosmo, my husband and I decided to take full use of our amazing room and bask in the glory of pizza on our balcony overlooking the Bellagio water show. In about twenty minutes, our pizza was ready and we were on that elevator so fast. The pizza was very good and a nice break from formal dining on the Strip.

But the pizza was heaven, I went for good old plain cheese, it's the easiest way to tell if its really good pizza, cuz it can stand on its own. Gooey, cheesy, nice sheen of grease over the top, crust was good for being in Las Vegas. prices were excellent. The staff was fun and friendly.  The \"pizza man\" scolded my hubby for picking up the pepper shaker before trying the pizza, I swear his accent was fake but he was entertaining, made the wait in line easier.\nI can't wait to go back.

He then said something to the guy making the pizza, but 15 minutes later, still nothing.  I then decided to cut through the middleman and ask the guy making the pies myself.  I then saw him take a plain cheese that had been sitting out for about 10 minutes and throw some toppings on it and then into the oven.  After waiting for that long, I didn't care that my pizza wasn't even fresh, but the icing on the cake was that they didn't even get my order right.  There was a guy in front of me whose order was messed up too.  Honestly, if I hadn't already paid, I would've left or if I hadn't already left a 20+% tip, I would've left nothing (and I've never left nothing!).\n\nTry to avoid coming here on busy nights.

The kind you have dreams about. The kind that you tell your out of town friends to make trips for. The kind that you wait in 45+ minute lines for. Life. Changing. Pizza. I will happily drive out of my way, fight rush hour traffic and wait in a 30 person-deep line for this pizza because it is THAT good.\n\nI knocked two stars off because of the wait, which was due mostly to the fact that the staff had their buddies running back and getting special made orders and walking out past the line waving their fresh slices in front of a line full of hungry people whose blood sugar levels were ranging on a scale from straight delirium to I-will-stab-you-and-eat-your-pizza-before-I-call-an-ambulance. Several times, hoodlums of all sorts, waltzed past the line, through the back door, distracted the pizza makers from um, making pizza, by chit chatting and putting in special orders all the while the rest of us stood in line, trying to show some restraint and not walk out or commit homicide. It was completely rude and disrespectful to the patrons and this definitely tarnished my experience.\n\nHowever, if you're lucky enough to cross paths with Nico (from other reviews, I'm guessing this is the person who runs the joint) once you get to the front of the line, he turns on the charm and temporarily makes you forget that you're moments away from eating your own fingers. I got a slice of plain cheese and  white pizza out of necessity because those would be the fastest to put together and he suggested I put some tomato on the white pizza. Good choice-the tomato had such good flavor and tasted in season.\n\nOverall, this pizza will blow your mind grapes, but might be best to check this place out with a snack pack on you or go during the off hours (if there is such a time for this place, which I doubt there is).", "type": "review", "business_id": "eq6lQI039SBLC6sHm3idGA"}

I knew I had to try this place ASAP.\n\nLucky for me, I work on the Strip so my co-workers and I went during lunch. Good thing I did my research or we would've never found the place. It was like a treasure hunt... third floor, next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, down a secret hallway lined with album covers... and there it was!\n\nOnce I saw the white pizza come out fresh from the oven, I knew I wanted a slice of it before even hearing what's on it. A slice of the white pizza and a soda cost $7. Not too shabby at all.\n\nThe pizza was heavenly. The crust had the right amount of crispiness, garlic and cheesiness. I'm usually not a crust eater but I devoured every last bite. I seriously considered buying a whole box but didn't want to share with the whole office.\n\nThe real test was when I brought back a slice of cheese pizza to my co-worker, who is a New Yorker, and is very critical about restaurants that claim to have \"authentic New York pizza.\" He said the pizza was \"pretty damn good.\" \n\nI'm pretty sure you'll find me here at least once a week for lunch.
