They refused me because it wasn't 4 Peaks branded.  I have 4 peaks growlers at home, but it was dirty, so we didn't grab it. When I asked 3 other local breweries what they would do in a similar situation, I was told they would replace the growler or simply fill it. \nI can understand not wanting to fill a blank growler but refuse me your product?

They don't have live entertainment which may be a good thing since they don't need more noise.

I ordered the Italian Beef Beer Bread and my boyfriend ordered Bleu Light Special Burger. We also shared a pint of the Hop Knot IPA. The beer was exquisite. It had a rich flavor that you can really enjoy. I definitely want to go back and try their other ales. The wings were really good, too - a little spicy for my liking (we sampled all three flavors), but a good starter nonetheless. My boyfriend's burger was all right, kind of like any other burger.

I also loooved my Italian Beef Beer Bread. It came in a wrap instead of sandwich.

Although my absolute FAVORITE is the Pumpkin Porter seasonal, in off season I'm happy with any of their beer, but usually stick with some Peach Ale. It gets crazy crowded on game days (of all sports and all teams) but always worth the wait. They have the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had. The servers are 100% hit or miss. Usually I have a great service, but occasionally I've had terrible service (bad servers but still great food/beer). Oh, and parking is kind of rough... but even then I cannot give this place less than 5 stars b/c of their consistent food and drinks. Oh! And Sunday Brunch... bloody marys and peak's mimosas.
