My friend kept on telling me that this place had good sandwiches, and she was right! I first tried this place around 12:30am - 1am, so it's good if you have a late night craving.\n\nThe first sandwich that I had was the Caribbean jerk chicken. This was my first experience with jerk chicken, and it was full of flavor. The bread was also nice and toast as well. The second time I went I tried the Earl club. Out of the two sandwiches that I tried I would say that the Earl club was better, because of there were more ingredient to add to the flavor. Both sandwiches however were equally good, and I would order them again.\n\nWhat's really nice about this place is that they take your order really fast, and they make your sandwiches fast as well. There's also the added perks of being open late when you want a late night snack or something. In addition, all the sandwiches are 5.99, which is pretty good considering that things are usually more expensive in Vegas, especially on the strip.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2e2e7WgqU1BnpxmQL5jbfw"}

It usually doesn't get much safer than \"the Original,\" but I was so disappointed. No, I was devastated at how much of a letdown this sandwich was. The bread is good, but it was the best part about the sandwich. The fuckin BREAD. I could tell that Earl was going with a completely different concept with his sandwich than Ike (@ Lime). Whereas Ike mindfucks you with an avalanche of ingredients and flavors, Earl keeps his sandwiches as simple as possible. My Original had bread, meat, and sauce. That's it. I wanted so badly to appreciate the simplistic beauty of it, but I couldn't. It's just too boring.\n\nI had a bite of the Full Montagu, I was not impressed. I had a bite of the Italian.

I have to drive 25 miles to get there but it's worth it. Today for brunch there was no wait and the food and service was terriffic. The reviewers who said they no longer have crab legs lied. They have mounds of great tasting crab legs and even had an Asian ginger crab version. All of the seafood was great and there were many vegetarian choices as well. My guess is the tourist reviewers who don't like the M don't know anything about Las Vegas buffets. You cannot go wrong here at the M.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

I'll tell you why:  I can eat my worth & wait (you read that correctly, not weight; and it's like $33 and a 40 minute wait for brunch or dinner) there.  Why?  So many reasons, but the main one is the snow crab legs.  You can get 'em on ice or steamed, and I go for the latter.  I've never waited in line for them and they never run out which is amazing since God knows people like me are stuffing ourselves like gluttons with them.  \n\nLet me attempt to describe the dessert bar.  I didn't actually measure the length of this section of delectable, heaven-on-earth, but I'd estimate it's at least 30 yards in length and it caters to sugar-free dessert eaters as well as the rest of us more irresponsible feeders.  They offer every conceivable kind of pie (I didn't check for rhubbard) and cake you can fathom, plus danishes, cream puffs of multiple flavors, creme brule, cakes so beautiful you *almost* feel guilty to dismantle and eat, truffles and at least 10 flavors of gellato.  Maybe you're more of a after-dinner drinks kind of person.  That's fine, too.  They have a full alcohol bar plus an espresso machine so if you'd like a Bailey's Irish Cream hot coffee, just say so (and show your ID).  \n\nWhat's your palette prefer?--Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Italian, American, others?  Don't worry; the M's got your tongue.  I'm a dangerous kind of buffet diner in that my eyes are often bigger than my stomach and so I have to really try not to waste food.  If you suffer from this same kind of temptation, try to pace yourself and do small portions each trip.  There's so much and it's so beautifully, invitingly laid out that you'll want to try it all.   \n\nThe environment is busy, but I never feel rushed to get out.  I mean, for crying out loud, I stood in line almost an hour to get seated so I'm going to take my time.  It's not like they're going to run out of food and if they run out of something, you're probably not going to notice since there's so many choices (unless it's the crab legs, and I've yet to experience that).  There's a loudness to the place, but it's not overwhelming, and that's probably partially because of the wide openness of the eating area.  It's well lit, not too crowded for such a popular establishment, and has a chic decor, but the thing you will never forget is the food--options, presentation, and taste.  It's been about a year since I last ate there and I can't forget the food, but the decor is blurry in my recollection.  \n\nForget what the Travel Channel says about the Strip's buffets; they still will pale in comparison to what The M has to offer.  I hear the rooms are nice, too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

If you have a ride and some time, I would recommend the short drive. On weekends they offer some seafood options in their buffet. Apparently on this particular weekend that we went, there was a special deal for lunch time: $16 per person (regular price is about $30ish). Score!\n\nDon't be fooled by thinking that just because the M Resort is located away from all the strip action that people aren't going to flock to this buffet. I highly advise you to come early or at least be ready to wait. Don't say you weren't warned. We got there around 1 pm and had to wait about a full hour before we got seated. By then, we were all starving and ready to eat everything in sight. \n\nI kid you not, there's tons of food here. As I stared at all the selecitons, I couldn't stop thinking about Mike Rowe and that one episode on Dirty Jobs where all the Vegas buffet leftovers are trucked out to the pig farm. \n\nThe food is fresh, clean, and your options is practically endless. There's everything from some sushi, to random Asian selections, to Mediterranean, as well as steam crab legs and boiled shrimp. They of course have prime rib as well as tri tip and ribs available. There's just too much to list. Not everything is a winner but overall you should find a good number of dishes that will entice your taste buds.\n\nLeave room for some dessert. There is an awesome gelato bar accompanied with many other sweet tooth selections.\n\nFor you big drinkers, there's a hidden open bar with unlimited wine and beer. It is located directly to your left as you enter the buffet. Don't miss out on it if you love to booze. They purposely keep it concealed for a reason.\n\nWe all literally rolled out of Studio B quite impressed, retardedly full, and ready to blow some gaskets. M Resort did have their last laugh though because as I was trying to digest all that grub in their casino, their tables robbed me for $250. In conclusion, that meal felt like it costed me $266.

When it came to this review however, I had a long, intense internal debate.  In the scheme of food I have eaten in my life, this buffet certainly is not going to come in win, place or show.  That being said, I felt it only fair to compare it to other buffets and thus my five star ranking.  In many ways if your looking for the best buffet in Vegas when factors like price, setting and options are considered, I might suggest this is #1 in Vegas.\n\nI have eaten at Studio B multiple times at all times of the day and have found the food consistent. delicious and with care put into the preparation and presentation.  On weekends, the bounty of seafood that is provided is top notch.  It includes Crab legs (both warm and cold), shrimp and a number of fish options like baked salmon and mahi-mahi.  There are also sushi rolls if you should choose to weigh down your gut with rice.  \n\nMeats are rep'd as well and the carving station boasts tri-tip, prime rib, chicken & turkey.  Salad, fruit and other vegetarian options looked and tasted appealing for a carnivore like me....no small feat.  \n\nWhile not a huge desert guy, the pastries and gelato here are fantastic.  Yes you heard me right....gelato!  And not just two flavors either but a full assortment ranging from pistachio to coffee.\n\nAnd then it brings me to my favorite part of the experience............free booze!!!!  For the price of all buffets, draught beer and wine is included.  I know, I know its not fancy beer (Coors Light) or wine but you can drink as much of it as you like.  And believe me when I say after your third glass of beer it really doesn't matter what type of beer is being consumed.\n\nFinally, one of the true underrated features of Studio B buffet is the setting.  Arranged in a circular room with the food beginning on the edges and working its way all the way into the middle, this buffet space feels inviting and fun.  Also at the very back is a large panoramic window that overlooks the entire Las Vegas Valley giving great views and a healthy dose of natural light...a rarity in the world of incandescent casinos.\n\nOverall Studio B buffet might not knock your socks off but simply by virtue of deciding to patronize a buffet, its clear that culinary excellence is not the most important thing.  In that vein, Studio B is your best choice...much like the 2008 presidential election.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

Buffets are an integral part of any Las Vegas trip, and after eating at the M Resort Buffet, I have found a new favorite.  This was actually the last meal my cohort and I had before leaving for home on a Sunday afternoon - and I gotta say, it was a blissful way to end the trip.\n\nI know this review won't do the place any justice, since there's tons of food that I did not even get to try.  But here's my attempt:\n\nI must mention that on this particular lunch excursion, the M was offering the seafood lunch, which is apparently different from the usual lunch menu.  Just something to keep in mind.  \n\nOXTAIL soup:  this is one of my favorite dishes of the afternoon.  Tender, tender pieces of oxtail in savory broth.  I wanted to get huge bowlfuls, but I restrained myself so I could have room for more food.  I am still craving that flavor 30 hours later.  I am seriously going to try making this dish at home, in hopes that it will be on par with the M.\n\nBeef Panaang: yummy with rice.  I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nPoke salad: I love poke, and I love trying different restaurants' versions of it.  This was pretty good, although not the best I've had, but commendable.  \n\nOssobuco: This is the first time I've tried this dish.  It made me happy.  \n\nChicken Florentine: wonderful, creamy flavor - and moist chicken.  \n\nCandied Yams:  Another one of my favorite dishes!  I usually skip over this dish at most buffets - but, well done, M, well done.\n\nCrabs:  There must have been at least three different type of crab legs.  Some served on ice, warm snowcrab legs, and chinese style ginger crab.  All very good.\n\nRaw Oysters: I just love it when a buffet serves raw oysters.  I go to town!\n\nThere's definitely much, much more in the entree section, but you'll have to check it out for yourself.  Now onto DESSERTS!\n\nI usually don't care for desserts much at a buffet.  But it's a whole other story here.  CREME BRULEE!  Wow!  It's just perfectly done.  A nice crispy, caramelized sugar top, and flecks of vanilla bean throughout the body of the creme!  YUM YUM YUM!  \n\nThey also have a wonderful cheesecake, a pretty wide selection of gelato, and even espresso drinks made to order.  All the desserts were presented beautifully as well.  I've converted to a buffet dessert lover because of this place :)\n\nAnd for all your alcohol-loving yelpers, beer and wine included!!!

It's easy to see why Studio B won the award for \"Best New Buffet\" in Vegas for 2010.  It's also the only \"all you can drink\" buffet in terms of wine and beer. In terms of sheer selection, Studio B has got the Bellagio and Wynn buffets beat.  The dessert bar is pure decadence, with just about every kind of beautifully decorated, delectable dessert you can imagine.  Other highlights: crab legs and prime rib (a staple).  Surprisingly, I was also a big fan of their sweet potato with marshmallows.  Areas for improvement: the oysters did not look fresh (at all), and I wasn't a huge fan of their osso bucco (though it's a dish I normally love).  Additionally, they don't have as many of the \"exotic\" meat selections as the Bellagio dinner buffet.  For the price, though, Studio B really can't be beat.

I'm not big on buffets and neither is my girl but we had heard so much that we had to try it out on our way out of Vegas. \n\nThe resort seemed nice enough. This review is just for the food. \n\nFirst thing first....All you can drink wine and beer. So the wine wasn't the best quality but it was nice and chilled and a major bonus since I wasn't expecting it. The buffet boasted over 200 items to choose from. It was presented very nicely and the overall feel of the place felt very open and spacious. Everything we tried was flavorful and piping hot. Which was a bit of a pleasant surprise. Since it was close to Chinese New Years they had a very large Asian selection. The korean ribs were amazing as well as the orange chicken. I love ginger and they had fresh chopped ginger as a garnish. Who does that? Kudos for all the fresh condiments.\n\nWe are not much into seafood but saw that everyone else was. Plates and plates of crab legs, oysters and mahi mahi. There was shrimp cooked in multiple ways and all kinds of sauces to dip into. \n\nAsian, Italian, American and everything in between there was something for everyone. And the dessert spread was amazingly good. They have over 25 flavors of gelatto and you can also have a latte or mocha made fresh! They had some pistachio raspberry concoction that was just way too good to pass up.  \n\nThe only  negative was the wait..... but it is well worth it. We waited for about 45 minutes and there was only 4 couples ahead of us. So patience is key.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

But there are some things that I wasn't liking.  \n\nLocated inside the newly built M Resort, Studio B Buffet has a very nice structure for their entrance way.  It seems like that they took the time to figure out the set up and how its going to look, once people stands in line.  Even though, it was kind of busy when we got there, at least they got something for us to read, or to look at.  Mainly something to keep us entertained while waiting in line to get a table.  The line was moving quickly, since they had two cashiers to check you in.  Quickly after, they had some one escort us to our table.\n\nThe setting was very nice, it look like a big \"C\".  It is very spacious and roomy.  Enough space to move around, and not hit other tables.  But, the buffet line itself, I didn't like the fact that its all on one line.  I like buffet, where you can move around the island and pick something else, when your waiting for another item to be open.  But the fact of people jumping in front of you and you don't want to jump in front of others, seems a bit awkward in a way.  \n\nThe selection of the food, is AMAZING.  They have something that I'm sure everyone would love.  Especially a buffet with Sushi, I would eat that all day if  could.  But, going there at a point where its really busy, the food tend to be slim pickings when your up there.  Since everyone is jumping to get what they want, by the time you get to a certain food, some one already grabbed it before you did.  So the cooks were kind of slow to bring out the food.  On the other hand, it was kind of expected, since it was during busy hours.  \n\nThe staff, I believe, was absolutely awesome.  From the point of checking with the cashier, to being escorted to our tables, to the waitress who made sure our glass was never empty.  It was very warming that these staff will still smile and say thank you, despite how busy it was.  \n\nI would recommend this Buffet, if you don't mind people jumping in front of you to pick at food.  But the taste overall was great, the selection was awesome, and the staff was very friendly.  Overall, I would highly recommend this Buffet Style.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

I think I tried at least half of the desserts and two little scoops of ice cream! They even have a little coffee/ espresso machine thing and you can order drinks for after your food. And speaking of drinks, they also have a DRINK bar, yes, those kinds of drinks.

This is, hands down, the BEST buffet in Vegas.  Wynn, Bellagio, Paris, Rio's seafood buffet do not even compare to this.  Another added bonus is the price!  Only $29.99 and all you can eat WARM crab legs with butter.  They have cold crab legs as well, but I prefer the warm ones.  The crab meat was juicy, but not salty.\n\nOther highlights from the buffet that were my faves: Candied yams w/ marshmallows, Prime rib, Japanese cold tofu salad, shrimp cocktail, and these french-fries/tater-tot things by the crab station. \n\nDesserts:  Pretty much every dessert I grabbed was delicious. I've never had better dessert at any of the other buffets.  The gelatto was good, but I found the miniature desserts much better:  creme brulee, pistaccio creme thing in a shotglass, tiramisu.  My fave: Oreo cream pudding in shotglass (so rich & chocolately). \n\nOnly downside:  VERY long wait time...but once you're in, it'll be all worth it", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

And I got none of those things.  \n\nIt was good food, don't get me wrong - good quality, delicious buffet. However, it was nothing different about M buffet than Bellagio or Venetian. Waited in line for about an hour or so only to realize that Sunday was also counted as the weekend (I know, duh) and therefore, had to pay the full 30 dollars for the seafood buffet brunch. I was REALLY expecting M to be amazing with all the raves from my friends but it was just...normal vegas buffet. \n\nI did, however, like the extent of their asian section! Overall, if I were driving to or from Vegas and wanted a nice, good buffet - I would go to M buffet but ONLY if it were on the way to something.

That's right you lushes, you can eat, drink and be merry all you want. Ok, maybe tone it down on the merry part if you don't want to get kicked out. This place had a HUGE buffet. Italian, Japanese, Hawaiian, Thai, BBQ... etc. And the dessert bar was amazing. Creme brulee? HELL YEAH!!! A gelato bar too. The list of food goes on and on. I didn't even get to part of the buffet because I ate too much. The restaurant is very elegant looking for a bufftet. Expect to wait in line for a while because I did. If you got a noisy kid, there's a sign that tells you to take that kid out and kick their ass. Ok maybe not in those words but you get the idea. This is the best buffet that I've been to in Vegas.

Why you ask? To make their gamblers stay at the hotel longer, therefore raking in more revenue. Smart ass business plan they got there, they even have the weekdays covered with special deals such as \"Senior Wednesdays\" (a horror fest with all 60+ seniors filling the entire casino to the brim with walkers and wheel chairs). The M resort definitely cares more about making their gamblers stay; they hand out comped meals like candy therefore making the VIP line EXTREMELY long on top of the EXTREMELY long waiting lines thus translating to absolutely absurd waiting times.\n\nAnother point observed in my 5+ visits there (which all ended up driving back on the strip since it was packed to the brim), apparently they also offer meal passes (all day any day) to locals, so forget about going on weekends when the entire city of LV is trying to grab a good deal.\n\nThe M resort has made their star buffet too accessible to the masses. Just a warning to people who don't want to wait 3+ hours for a 20 dollar buffet. Are you seriously going to waste hours of your time just to save a few dollars on a buffet? Spend the extra 10 and go on to Bellagio and the Wynn, their lines move way faster now (waited 30 or less minutes for both of them on a WEEKEND during dinner rush).  \n\nOr wait a few years until the old folks that flood the lines to croak from too much crab legs and beef fat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

Or is it just me?  \n\nAnyway, my favorite buffet for years has been the Bellagio Buffet.  Probably what made it the best was the awesome selection and the king crab legs that they served.  The last time I went there though, they didn't have king crab legs so then I really had no real strong desire to HAVE to go back there.  I mean, let's be honest.  A buffet is a buffet is a buffet.  Right?  WRONG!\n\nStudio B in the M Resort has ousted the title of best buffet in Vegas, in my book.  *erasing Bellagio and writing in Studio B*  First of all, the selection.  Once you enter the dining area after the line for the ends after over an hour long wait, you'll see that it looks like a maze.  But I thought to myself, \"Ah, it's probably another one of those buffets that have duplicate dishes on either side, to make the line more efficient, right?  WRONG!\n\nEvery single plate, nook, cranny of that line has a different dish.  I think what I like best about this buffet is that there's a lot of Asian themed dishes here, reminiscent of dishes that you can find in Hawaii.  Yes, I'm Asian.  (You just looked at my profile picture again just to make sure I wasn't lying, didn't you?) And yes, I'm from Hawaii.  So when there's something on the buffet line in a resort NOT located in The California Hotel or in the Main Street Station Hotel and Casino, it's actually pretty impressive.  Kal bi?  Teriyaki steak?  Wow.  If I lived in Vegas, this would definitely be a place that I would come to so I could get  my local food fix.  They also have crab legs!  OK, so it's not king crab legs.  But it was still delicious!  \n\nSo what's the worst part of a buffet?  Having to pay for drinks when you already paid a lot for the food, right?  WRONG!  They even give you unlimited wine and beer here!  When I went, I didn't have any since I don't like to drink when I'm trying to binge eat and pretend I'm not going to eat again for a week.  But next time I go, I'm definitely going to get some alcohol to consume with my meal.\n\nWhat's the second worst part of a buffet?  Poor service, right?  WRONG!  The service here was great.

Yes, it's a drive (10 miles off the strip) but it's totally worth it.  The M hotel is amazing and the buffet definitely beats the ones on the strip.  The seafood buffet is totally worth it, cause they have CRAB LEGS.  Dungess crab legs.  both hot and cold.  and they have oysters on the half shell.  amazing.\n\nThey also have unlimited beer and wine, but I tend to stick to the food not wanting to waste the precious food space on alcohol.  The desserts are also amazing too.  They have many different choices, including amazing macaroons, as well as the 20 different flavors of ice cream and gelato.  AND they have a coffee bar as well.\n\nThis place is huge as well and has a huge selection of food.  So much that my bf came back to the table and i looked at his plate and said \"you ran out of room halfway, didn't you?\" and he nodded sheepishly.  Don't worry, I ran out of room halfway too.", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

Indeed; Unlimited beer, wine, espresso and dessert are all pretty awesome!\n\nHowever, the food itself was mainly just mediocre after our wait. The line moved at a decent clip for having only two cashiers available and once we were inside we were quickly seated. The first round proved to me two things;\n\n1) Lots of salads were available, which was kind of nice as it showed an appreciation of fresh vegetables and salads that is often skipped at buffets\n2) Lots of carby, simply options as de rigeur at most buffets (mashed potatoes, breads, rice, pastas, etc)\n\nI loaded up with a slice of galbi (overly sweet and tasted of sugar, though it had a pleasant charcoal-like flavor), several cold shrimp, a slice of salmon nigiri (shrivelled and dry salmon, skipped the rice), several oyster (mostly mushy and full of ice chunks) and a spring roll (crisp but pretty average)  and a bowl of clam chowder (good, with lots of chunks of seafood but not comparable to the clam chowder at an oyster bar in florida...).  My boyfriend and our friend grabbed a piece of rib eye, then saw that there were much better rare slices out and went for those instead. The first slices they grabbed were over cooked and dry, probably having sat under the heat lamp for too long. The fresher slices had more flavor and were finished quickly. We also tried some of their crab legs, which were tasty but were skinny with little meat.\n\nThey added fresh oysters to the buffet and those were a bit better, though I had to wait for them to thaw out before I could eat them.\n\nThe dessert area was pretty nice; they have a wide selection of gelato flavors available as well as many mini desserts, cannolis (tasty) ,  creme brulees (delicious!), fruit tarts (good), cappuccinos (nice, and they come with a free shot of flavoring) and many other goodies. Definitely one of the highlights of the buffet!\n\nThe selection changes each night and the customer service is decent given how busy they are. We accidentally spilled a water and it was never replaced, nor did we ever receive additional napkins. Just minor things, but when you're sampling several different types of dishes it's nice to be able to clean your hands or palate.. \n\nI'd be willing to go back and see if it's worth a higher rating eventually, but it's a bit expensive for a buffet. If I'm going to go out for a seafood buffet I'll probably go to an AYCE sushi place first.\n\nIt's a pretty good selection and it's another option for a seafood buffet", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

Although my first experience was after a liver crushing weekend in Vegas, I'd have to agree but with reservations.\n\nWe came on a Sunday around 4 o'clock. The line was moderately long at this point, we waited for around 30 minutes to finally get in. Price was pretty standard buffet fare at $30 something dollars. The buffet has an odd configuration, you really won't know where to start. There is a nice selection of food, definitely better than any other Vegas buffet. You can even get your drank on at the bar.\n\nNotice how I'm pretty vague about the food? Well, to me, it's still buffet food. I'm not wild on buffet food. The crab legs aren't cut in half like they are at Wynn's either. I'd go go there for the sheer convenience of their crab legs. \n\nIf you don't like buffet food, the M buffet probably won't magically change your stance on the subject.

Let's just talk about the buffet.  Overall the food is fair.  For $29.99 you can enjoy a 'seafood buffet' which means you get the leftovers from everything not eaten by yesterday's crowds with some additional crab legs, mahi-mahi and shrimp.  The crab legs are a little too fishy tasting as they sit in heaps next to a vat of melted butter which has particles of various foods floating in it.  Typically, people at buffets get in line for the crab legs, well, not at this place and now I know why.  Their crab is disgusting.  Some of the other buffet mentionables include marginal prime rib and tri-tip beef.  The desserts I would say are above average, particularly the coconut macaroons and cr\u00e8me brule.  How this buffet got dubbed 'Best Buffet' in LV by Best of Las Vegas is a joke and somebody is definitely on the take.  \nHowever, the average food gets overlooked by the poor service across the board.  From top to bottom, the cashiers, maitre de, servers, etc are all less than helpful.  After 45 minutes in line to enter the buffet, there was a guy in front of my party who brought a wedding party of 60 (all of whom were gambling, shopping or whatever rather than waiting in the line) to the front of the line as he approached the cashiers.  No they didn't have a reservation.  No they didn't pay together.  They each paid separately and this was a total inconvenience to the 150+ people who actually waited in line and it created about a 20 minute standstill log jam and the line didn't move while servers scrambled to create a table to fit a party of 60.  I think the M could have prevented this by having a line usher to police the line.  When I expressed my opinion of that its poor policy to have 1 person wait in line for a party of 60, without a reservation, without paying altogether, the Maitre De, just didn't seem interested to listen at all.  Utter shame.  \nI thought I was going to a highly touted local casino with a touch of classy.  Well, I was mistaken.  For those of you looking to go to a classy locals casino, hit up the Green Valley Ranch Resorts.  Better atmosphere, gaming, food and they know how to treat people.   \nI will never step foot in the M resort ever again and neither will my friends or family.   So guess how many stars I'm giving the M?", "type": "review", "business_id": "vxxMqBaAHuWdx4impsLSSA"}

Well, looks like there's a new candidate for my favorite spot to eat at when in Vegas.\n\nThe M Resort is off the strip, but regardless of that fact, it's a beautiful hotel.  It's nice, clean, doesn't smell too much like smoke (a plus if you've ever been in a Vegas casino), and best of all....the famous M Buffet, or Studio B Buffet!  I've heard about this place before from a lot of friends, so I pretty much knew that it'd be good food, but it wasn't until I was in the line grabbing my food that the awesomeness started settling in.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the seafood.  I'm asian so I love crab legs, oysters, and muscles.  Needless to say that was the first thing that I grabbed.  They also had so much meat!  Beef, chicken, pork, fish, etc.  If it wasn't extinct, then it was probably being served...haha!  Salads, ehh...not much of a salad person, but hey they had your typical salads, pasta salads, fruit salads, etc.  Pastries were awesome, as well as your regular kids foods like pizza, fries, chicken wings, etc.  I still get those!  The best part is....all you can DRINK beer and wine.  Yup, that's right!  Beer and wine is included in the price.  The desserts were really good too.  Everything I tried was just really good.  The gelato was pretty awesome too.  I thought I saw red velvet gelato and I almost cried tears of joy, but it turned out to be strawberry...I cried a little in the inside though...haha.  All in all, food galore!\n\nThis place exceeded my highest expectations.  I was a bit skeptical thinking that no buffet was worth $30, when I could just go to other buffets that are like $15.  I was definitely proven wrong.  I paid $30 for a buffet that was worth every single cent.  This is a place that I'm definitely going to go to everytime I'm in Vegas.  So check it out for yourself.

Not sure if it was the good company, the good service, the good food, or all of the above.  I probably won't eat a full meal here next time im in town, but will return for their desserts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

Ordered the 11 dollar traditional sundae and paid extra for a second sauce topping--that's fine except they basically left out the FIRST topping, so it's good thing I paid extra for the second topping or else there woulda been NO topping.  Ice cream is supposed to be their thing, so they really need to bring up the standard here because it was NOTHING special at all, and was in fact substandard.  It's in a good location and it's good to see the site right on the strip of Ceasar's being utilized but the decorating could use some oomph and you have to go outside the restaurant to a public bathroom that was like a parking garage bathroom and it was very cold out there.

We decided on a more of a dessert kind of feel dinner, and so we decided on a place called Serendipity 3. Located right off the strip in front of Caesars, it definitely wasn't an easy restaurant to access. As soon as we were seated our waiter just dropped off menus without saying one word and let us be. After what seemed like an eternity, the waiter finally came back and asked us if we were ready to order. I then immediately asked if I can get the restaurant week menu. The waiter then replied saying that there were no specials that he was aware of. I literally busted out my phone and showed him that Serendipity 3 was a part of restaurant week and showed him the specials. He then left and asked one of his fellow colleagues that acknowledged that they did have a restaurant week menu. So the waiter comes by and finally acknowledges that there was a special menu, without any sort of an apology. He took our order and then left. I'm a very patient person when it comes to bad service. What I mean is I have taken a lot of crap without complaining, but this guy was just the worst. First of all he was very soft spoken, and had a very bad attitude problem. What's the first rule of working in the service industry? Leave your problems at the door, and put a smile on your face. This guy definitely needed a lesson in service. Anyways, after all the rude remarks and attitude he gave us while ordering, our food finally came out. Before our food even came out, I noticed the waiter just went around and asked everyone else how they were doing, and completely ignored us. I was without a drink for 15 plus minutes, and did I mention the food came out very slow. I can tell it wasn't the cooks fault, it was our waiter. My chicken dish I've ordered was cold to the core; not even a little feel of warmth. I just let it slide and finished my dinner. The most anticipated part of the meal finally came out, dessert. I've noticed that he has gotten our order wrong, and then informed him of his mistake. Once again without any apology he just takes the plate without a word. I can see his facial expression of disgust as he walked away. The nerves of this guy were incredible! To make the story short, we enjoyed our dessert very much.  Needless to say our waiter never came back after correcting his mistake. My friends and I sat there socializing for a long period of time.  All I can hear is the slurps from the straw, since the drinks were empty. Honestly I just wanted the check so we can leave, but our waiter was nowhere to be found.  When I finally saw our waiter, I politely tried to gain his attention. He totally just ignored me and walked on by. Finally I went up to the front and asked if I could get my check, and the hostess instructed us to ask our waiter. At this point I was furious and asked for a manager. The manager was very nice and offered us a complimentary lunch on them. One thing I believe the manager made a mistake was when he said, \"Yeah, we get complaints on him all the time.\" When I heard that, in my head I was like, \"Then why is he still working here!?\" Thanks to that rude waiter, I will never go back to Serendipity again. I even have a complimentary meal, but no thanks!", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

So after lunch at Enoteca, we headed down the strip and went to give this place a shot.\n\nWe grabbed a table outside and went to order our treats from the outside window.

Kind of expensive but large portions/sizes.  Frozen Hot Chocolate (fro-ho-cho, anyone?) is like a milkshake with a little bit of a grainy texture.  Good and sweet but not amazing.

The lively crowd, the colorful decor and Jammin' Music created an Amazing atmosphere that made our experience here Super Duper Fun! We were seated on the patio and it made it just more romantic. We started off with the Kobe Sliders with a side of sweet potatoes fries and to top it off with the Frozen Hot Chocolate. The Sliders were not memorable and just plain average. The sweet potatoes fries was crispy and tasted sweet as potato pie. I would have to say this was the best part of the meal. Now on to the finale, the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate. It came out melted and it reminded me of frozen chocolate shake. I was not impressed with the price ($14) or the taste! I think McDonald's chocolate shake will give Serendipity a run for their money.

The food was pretty good, but the service was pretty awful. We started off with the spudkins (potato skins) for an appetizer, which were really good and a big portion. My boyfriend got the steak sandwich, which he thought was okay/good. I ordered the high heel pump sandwich (prosciutto, mozzarella, arugula, tomatoes, etc). It had great flavor, but was piled with so many tomatoes, I had to take the majority of them out just so I could taste something other than tomatoes. Both sandwiches were huge and came with fries, which I thought was good for the price. We also ordered the frozen hot chocolate for dessert since so many people seem to love it and recommend it. I love all types of sweets but my boyfriend and I both agreed the frozen hot chocolate was definitely nothing special. While we enjoyed most of the food, we were sooo disappointed by the service. About two minutes into receiving our appetizer, the waiter brought out our sandwiches (this is something that realllly annoys me). Then, we went through the entire meal without our waiter checking on us once, which meant no drink refills when we needed it. After about a half hour, our waiter finally came over to refill our drinks which we then waited about another 15 minutes for him to do so. We also noticed that his other tables were not being waited on as well..(Not to mention, the place was not busy by any means) Once our dessert came, our waiter asked us how we liked the frozen hot chocolate... twice... within a couple minutes of each other. We both came to the conclusion that he seemed to be a little drunk!  Overall, the food has good flavor and comes in very generous portions for the price you're paying.

Our waiter was cool, upbeat, and even switched tables for us when he heard us joking that it wasn't level. \n\nI've met very few mac and cheeses I didn't like, but this one was off the charts. It came in a deep dish with a rich sauce and prosciutto chunks. So perfect for a cold, hungover day.

It consisted of cocoa, milk, ice, and i believe sugar was mixed in there also. It gets nicely blended and topped with a ginormous amount of whipped cream and chocolate shavings. My friend's frozen oreo hot chocolate was topped with pieces of oreos and a piece of chocolate egg roll on each side. I guess that's what an extra $4 gets you. \n\nAs soon as i took a sip, I literally jizzed in my pants. Ok, not really. But it was damn good! It was not too sweet - just the perfect amount of sweetness, just perfect. I took a sip of the frozen oreo hot chocolate and it was just as good maybe even a tad bit better! It was a little more on the sweeter side though...so I prefer the original over the oreo.\n\nMoments later, our sandwich comes out and my goodness i was not expecting the BLT to be so huge! - probably a 6 x 6 cut in half...or even bigger! There were thinnly slices of turkey which was stacked to about 3 inches thick (I'm not even kidding), topped with crispy, smoked bacon (sooo good), lettuce, tomatos, the usual...everything tasted so fresh and just soooo good! \n\nI'm so glad we stayed and waited.

We heard about the rave of the \"Frozen Hot Chocolate\" and wanted to find out what the hype was all about.\n\nIt was around 3pm and to be expected, the place was mad busy.  There was an hour and 1/2 wait for a party of 8.  There was plenty of outdoor tables and the weather was absolutely phenomenal during the month of March. We decided to try out their take out orders.  It's a limited menu but again, we were there strictly for dessert.\n\nWe were in line for 45 minutes.  I don't understand why there was a long wait when the orders consisted of ice cream.  I passed on the frozen hot chocolate - why do I need to spend $15 on a milkshake?  I went with the huge chocolate donut and the Forbidden Sundae which consisted of chocolate cake, chocolate and vanilla cream, whip cream, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.  I waited another 15 minutes for my order to be prepared.  I saw my sundae sitting on the counter underneath an air vent that was melting my ice cream. It took another 10 minutes for the server to grab my donut.  By the time I was handed my sundae, the whip cream turned into milk and spilled over the cheesy cup.  The cake was hard and chewy.  The ice cream underneath and had already turned into mush.  It was the MESSIEST sundae I have ever dealt with.  It was sooo messy, that it got me angry and I just wanted to throw it away! The donut was nothing special....just  big.\n\nThis was the worst experience ever! Everyone wants to eat here because of the movie; well, I'm hear to tell you that the service and food is below standard!  WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!

Great food, excellent service and fun atmosphere.  We were there on a little vacay last week, and ate there twice.  The first time Kevin was our server.  The hostess promptly sat us with no wait, even though there was one, because we are diamond members.  She was super nice and so was Kevin.  They both remembered us when we came back 2 days later, and made a point to come over and ask us about our stay and activites we did.  The second time I think our server's name was Mylin.  She was super nice, and even though she was busy she took good care of us.  In fact we had to rush out to catch our flight, and even though the table next to us asked her to split a check about 38 different ways, she still got us our bill promptly.   The food both times was amazing.  I'm not big on the frozen hot chocolate, but cold stuff isn't my thing.  I did have an AMAZING mochachino.  And the Mac N Cheese is TO DIE FOR.  I'm pretty amused at all the people who docked them points for being expensive.  Um, hello?  this is Vegas, on the Strip, at Ceasars Palace.  These are probably the same people that have no problem shelling out $30 to get into the Night Club du jour, and then pay $15 per drink while there.  Please.

Suddenly, I had images of sitting in our hotel room overlooking the bellagio fountain with dark clouds and rainfall, snuggled up while sipping their famous frozen hot chocolate.  It sounded like a dream! We ordered the Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate for Two.  It was made quickly and topped with a generous dollop of whipped cream with 2 long straws.  The size of the frozen treat was likened to that of a Big Gulp than that of a milkshake.  But with the expensive price tag, we were satisfied with the gargantuan portion.  The first sip was light, frothy, creamy, with just the right amount of oreo embedded into each slurp.

I've probably been here 5 or 6 times and each time the experience was a little different.  It's a bit more touristy than some other locales since it is one of the family/kid friendly spots. Avoid prime eating times to get the shortest wait. It's a bit unavoidable during the summer but you can call ahead for a reservation or just pick up something to go and enjoy the AC inside. Their to-go menu offers most of the items on the regular menu! and for those complaining..you're in Vegas, you should be prepared to spend anyhow.\n\nThe decor of this place is a bit vintage with some really cute touches like the giant sundae by the stairs and the Tiffany's lamps. If it's a really hot day, try to get indoor seating... which will probably bump up your wait. The patio has the water misters and is ventilated but you'll still feel the summer heat. \n\nService isn't bad. They get their food out in a reasonable time but at times it can be hard to get a hold of your server. If you get thirsty while waiting for your table, head over to the bar counter inside and you can get tall cups of ice water.\n\nThe food is in good sized portions, so you're not overpaying too much; its like any designer item, there's a cost for that label. I've tried a bunch of things on the menu but here are some that I can remember well... Kobe Sliders are delicious if you're looking to get something on the smaller side. The foot long hotdog comes with alot of condiments and you can add toppings. The Mac n Cheese was really good. Try the Ahi Salad and the Hangover Omelette! \n\nOrder the Frozen Hot Chocolate. it's probably what you came here for. Don't gripe about the cost because you shouldn't be in Vegas if you're not willing to spend some money. If you don't like it, at least you can say you've tried it. Personally it's a must order when I come. Why? It's different. Some of my friends have pointed out it kinda tastes like Hershey's chocolate but it's a nice alternative to soda and alcohol.\n\nOne day I'm gonna order the Golden Opulence Sundae just to say I've tried it ;) And a trip to their New York location is on my checklist as well !\n\n- jenn", "type": "review", "business_id": "Xhg93cMdemu5pAMkDoEdtQ"}

Despite my multiple trips to Sin City in the past I'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of \"twisted farm food\" - Hash House A Go-Go.  Having heard that a third (the other in San Diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the Imperial Palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.\n \nWith late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a HHAGG shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt Hash House does everything big.  Taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, Noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  Menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  Hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because \"oh man, we thought this was a buffet.\"  Clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.\n \nSitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  With prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when I chuckled saying okay the response was \"you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it\" - clearly I'm jaded.  Sitting back and listening to Rock You Like a Hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.\n \nArriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  With a sweet, a savory, and a \"dessert\" there was too much food for four people.  Beginning first with the Blackberry Granola Flapjacks, my sister's choice although I'd lobbied for the Snickers Flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  With ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.\n\nPerhaps the most famous Hash House dish would be my order - \"Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.\"  Golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  Stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel I have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  While clearly not as subtle and refined as Bouchon's chicken and waffles I actually much preferred this to Roscoe's famous Los Angeles version and the less famous option at DC's Founding Farmers.\n\nOur dessert would be Andy's famous Bread pudding topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  With the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this bread pudding is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  A portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan.  Buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted Snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  Like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.\n\nSettling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had P.U.B. leftovers and the Robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to the door accompanied by Eddie Van Halen's Eruption.  Generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food Hash House A Go Go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

Doesn't matter of what, just as long as it provides me with some visual entertainment. With food, I love seeing the large and outlandish, quality is secondary and not expected but is always welcome. During my Vegas research, Hash House seemed the perfect spot for just that.\n\nOrganizing a party of 10 for breakfast in Vegas can be quite challenge, but luckily, everyone was late at about the same time. We actually didn't even have to wait that long for a table once our entire party was there. Once seated, the drink menu led me to my first show; a BLT Bloody Mary;\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=_-fQlooq5QREsociXJU7Yw\n\nCrisp toast, bacon, lettuce, and a tomato wedge all garnished this liquid meal. My first instinct was to smash all the solids into a pulp and mix them into my drink so I could suck down the slurry through the oversized straw. Luckily reason found me and I simply made a mini sandwich to munch on while sipping the well-made drink. \n\nI pondered ordering the famed tower of chicken and waffles, but I had a hankering for gravy that only gravy could satisfy. I ordered the biscuits and gravy at the recommendation of our server, based on my request of something large covered in gravy. After an expectedly long wait, our food began to pile in. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=bPvsgg04sxgX91PJmswpQQ\n\nThe biscuits were surprisingly light and fluffy and the gravy had about a pound of diced sausages in it. It was definitely something that would stick to your ribs. \n\nI also tried a bite of the \"stuffed\" burger and was very let down. We were expecting the ingredients to be cooked in the meat, not just placed between two over-cooked patties. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=xjtwgwuEKBkjvO0-k80eKw\n\nOverall though it was a fun meal with food better than I expected.

And in a way, it helped.\n\nThe restaurant is definitely much smaller than the Sahara location and it did feel a little congested.  It might have been because I sat at the bar instead of a table.  Also the vibe of the restaurant felt different maybe because it's on the Strip with more tourists whereas the Sahara location was more laid back.  The really good thing though is that their prices are pretty much the same so no inflated Strip prices here.\n\nAfter tackling Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict last time, I decided to try their Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=9bcLmRftsqxJ9ISx6atDlg). Boy, did I totally underestimate how doughy those Bacon Waffles would be.  I was a little bummed out that I didn't get too much syrup, but I was too hungry that morning to wait much longer.  I didn't think I did too bad though, I managed to leave just two waffles behind =).  The Chicken sadly was overcooked this time so overall I had a really doughy and dry meal.  If I had to choose my favorite between the Chicken and Waffles or the Fried Chicken Benedict, the Fried Chicken Benedict wins hands down.  Much more flavor and not very dry thanks to the Chipotle Cream Sauce.\n\nI probably won't be coming back to this location again unless I happen to be at Imperial Palace with a huge hunger attack.

Not to mention, the service was spectacular on both visits. \n\nOur group of 10 dined at Hash House twice for breakfast while in Vegas over Christmas. Staying at the Flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the Imperial Palace and up the escalator dedicated to Hash House. Getting to the restaurant before 9AM both times, the staff was easily able to accommodate our large group. The restaurant was largely empty that early, but did begin to fill up around 10AM. Our servers, on both occasions, were courteous, efficient, enthusiastic, and even charming. For me, that can really put a dining experience over the top. \n\nWhile the food was VERY good, being The Griddle cafe fanatic that I am, I cannot give Hash House 5 stars. Their pancakes (snickers) and french toast did not compare to the deliciousness that is The Griddle. \n\nBUT, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles is note worthy. Perfectly Fried Chicken breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best fried chicken I recall having (although I rarely eat fried chicken). The waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. This was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. The maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really highlighted the dish and I recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. \nIt was just YUM! My boyfriend and I split the dish and it was perfect for two people. The next visit we split the french toast which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread. The banana was disturbing at first being black from the griddle, but was actually delicious and perfectly cooked. It went well with the french toast. \n\nMany people at our table went with the Tractor Special, which was well received and the most traditional style breakfast item they offer. No one tried their hash, sadly. \n\nAny meal on the menu, if you can split it with someone, DO IT!

The wait was pretty long (45 minutes to get seated and another 45 to get our food) but we were given an accurate wait time and warned about the wait for breakfast when seated so I felt okay with the wait.\n\nI ordered the Tractor Driver Combo with a Snickers flapjack. The Snickers flapjack is a frisbee sized buttermilk flapjack with pieces of Snickers thrown right into the pancake. As the food arrived I could see the little Snickers craters throughout the pancake. Again, this is a gimmick, a candy bar baked into a pancake, c'mon! But I'll have to say, I thought it was delicious. Enough to think I should keep a Snickers bar in my pantry for all my pancake adventures.\n\nIs this the greatest restaurant of all time? Nope, but if you're in for the gimmick of big food that's over the top in its presentation, Hash House A Go Go will definitely deliver. I was also impressed by the Bloody Mary that my friend ordered that had a strip of bacon in it and was served with a side of toast.

The urban/farm type decor is different, but well kept and clean. The food here is an experience to say the least. The menu is expansive to say the least with specialties such as the O'Hare of the Dog which is a 14oz Budweiser and a side of bacon! Or the BLT Bloody Mary. They are known here for their Fried Chicken and Waffles which are extreme for sure. Please see a few of the pictures for the full impact. The service here was spot on, all the staff is younger sort of \"punk rock\" which fits the feel in general, but the food left me a bit confused. I never had the signature giant pancake or the chicken and waffles..But I did try several other items and found the experience to be pretty bi-polar. The home made giant biscuits that are given table side (and come with most any entree) are fun due to their sheer girth (that's right I said GIRTH!)...but one bit left me tasting baking soda and begging for honey, or butter, or jam...or anything to quench my now parched gullet. This went the same for their signature \"hashes\" for breakfast. The \"crispy potatoes\" they are all built upon reminded me of the potatoes found downstairs at the buffet...I had the \"Smoked Salmon\" skillet which was the driest experience laid upon potatoes I could have hoped for...Although the skillet meatloaf breakfast was a nice change. The \"stuffed\" burger here are tasty, but beware the horseradish mashed potatoes. I got these for dinner one night and lugged them back to my room. There was SOOO much horseradish on the taters that I literally coughed them right back up. I know I know..Sorry for the visual, but I don't want any fellow Yelper's getting sucker punched by these taters in the future.\nPerhaps I just ordered the wrong items 4 out of 7 meals, but I think if the food completely catches up with the service and hype, then this place is going to be a real Vegas draw!", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

Anyone who has read other reviews I've posted knows I like one meal above all others, breakfast.  Though my trips to Indiana have led me to believe that there is little redeeming of that state that borders mine to the southeast, but the Hash House A Go-Go may be it's greatest export.  \n\nWe had large group, so I'm sure that didn't help the wait, but the 2.5 hour breakfast we had was absolutely belly bustingly amazing!  Our waitress was pretty aware of our wait and did a nice job to make sure our group of 6 was well cared for and not waiting long for things like coffee and other refills.  She was also helpful in ordering.  If it's your first time there, I recommend ordering (or talking someone else at your table into ordering) the Chicken Farm Benedict.  This colossal tower of food was a sight to behold.  I went for the Tractor Driver Combo.  \n\nThe TDC was two eggs (over medium), bacon, wheat toast and my choice of pancakes, french toast or waffles.  This would normally be an easy choice (pancakes), but this place isn't your ordinary breakfast joint.  Far from the ordinary, the pancakes, french toast and waffles here are the size of a large platter.  And, with flapjacks like Blueberry Pecan, Brown Sugar Banana, Blackberry Granola, Snickers, Butterscotch Almond, Apple Cinnamon, Mango Coconut, Strawberry Frosted and granola waffles or banana cinnamon french toast...forget-a-bout-it...this is the real deal.  \n\nMy choice was made slightly easier when I saw Brown Sugar banana pancakes.  I think that banana pancakes rank up there with precious jewels, gold bullion and other fine items that ought be cherished.  This was a banana pancake on steroids!  It was incredible.  It was soft on the inside, crispy and caramelized on the outside and delicious everywhere.  If I could have finished the one that I ordered, I would've contemplated ordering a second.  It was worth the gut busting pain that was likely to follow.  \n\nSeriously, if you're in Vegas, and you have the time to wait for a seat, get to this place for breakfast.  Book some time before, and after, as you'll need to wait to get in and head back to your hotel for a food coma afterward.  This was a great meal and the perfect start to a 24 hour day in Las Vegas.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

I get mine stuffed with cheddar & bacon (skipping the avocado), one of three varieties. It comes with a steak knife and a sprig of sage stuck on the top. Tip: Use the knife; you cannot eat this burger whole. The burger is good beef, cooked just right. The side of fries is huge and they are cooked just right. The drizzle of BBQ sauce and the sticks of something add a nice touch. All-in-all, a burger, fries, and a lemonade will run you just over $20 (with tip) and will leave you with a good taste on your tongue, a warm feeling on your belly, and no need to eat for the rest of the day. \n\nI had a breakfast here too, a chicken breast deep fried with a maple glaze, grilled mashed potatoes with bacon, and two eggs w/ fruit & a biscuit on the side. Once again, the dish was huge. The chicken breast was magnificent. The biscuit was flaky and huge. I could not finish. I passed on the overpriced OJ to keep the cost below $15, but once again, this is a meal that can last you the day. \n\nHash House dies not try to be pretentious, like so many Strip establishments. It's hearty food, and while the prices seem Strip-like (that is, 50% higher just because it's in Vegas), the amount you get easily justifies the prices (at least for the food; they must make their nut on drinks, where even soda prices are stratospheric).

The television show spotlights local hot-spots, clubs, restaurants, etc.  The first time I saw them on television, the portions were huge (think Cheesecake Factory) and the food looked absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to visit the eatery until my next visit to Vegas.\n\nMy friend and fellow foodie were dead set on having Hash House for Sunday breakfast before he had to hit the road.  As we made our way to Imperial Palace, I was already drunk an it was only 10 or 11 in the morning.  After parking in the garage, we made our way into the casino and after asking some staff for directions, we made our way towards Hash House.\n\nI was pleasantly surprise that there was no waiting time for our party of two.  After a few more shots, I glanced over the extensive menu and settled for my guilty pleasure of french toast.  My fried ordered some variation of eggs Benedict.  The food took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table and we were both with smiles.\n\nThe french toast arrive an were beautifully presented and resemble a presentation from the Food Network.  The french toast were dense, yet fluffy and were nicely griddled to a golden brown and dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  The french toast were mouth watering and undoubtedly the best tasting french toast I've ever had.  In addition to the fluffy toast, caramelized banana slices accompanied the delicious toast.\n\nHash House A Go Go is a food experience that will forever be embedded in my mind and taste buds.  My friend's breakfast was equally up to par and gave him an equally satisfying food coma.  If I had to compare Hash House A Go Go to something it would be The Cheesecake Factory, but more intimate and with a mom and pop diner feel.  Oh Hash House A Go Go, how I miss you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

The waitress is obviously having wrist issues carrying them. What looks like eggs benedict is placed in front of another diner. I watch as he panics, having prepared no strategy for a serving of these proportions. \n\nI start to panic: I ordered the eggs benedict, too. We should have shared something, we lament. \n\nA couple has chicken and waffles deposited before them. It has a huge steak knife impaled through the mountain of it. It appears they are pulling out their phones to bid their family members goodbye. Or to take pictures. They might not make it through this.\n\nI had asked our waiter about the \"fresh-squeezed\" orange juice. His response is the reason why he's awesome: \"the box SAYS 'fresh-squeezed,' but ain't nobody back there squeezing oranges.\" Thank you, Lonzo. I'll have the lemonade.\n\nAnd then. Our food. Arrives. \n\nJust as I had feared: a bed of potatoes topped with 2 dense biscuits, topped with poached eggs, topped with a slightly spicy sauce of heart-attack doom. I look at the boy; he has his own concerns. I can almost see him beyond the pile of meat hash deluxe-ness before him. I tell him I love him before we start in.\n\nA few pathetic minutes later, we've done all we can. Lonzo knows the symptoms. Still, he refills my bottomless hand-squeezed lemonade, later providing a to-go cup when it becomes obvious I have no more stomach room to give. \n\nIn my deliriously bursting state, I think back to an innocent time, before we placed our orders. To all of the things we had planned to do that day, the shops we would visit and the sights we were going to see. It had once seemed possible. Now we just want to live to see beyond our stomachs again. Every day it gets a little better.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

Ever. \n\nMy boyfriend & I saw this place on one of the tourist channels in the hotel and they mentioned it had been featured on Man vs. Food. Now, we both enjoy watching that show but have never had the opportunity to try one of the places where Adam has gorged himself so we knew that we simply had to try this place before we went back home. And in my opinion, it could not have been better.\n\nFirst, I had fairly low expectations for this place because it is in a pretty seedy looking casino on the strip. I mean, I had never even heard of the Imperial Palace let alone knew that it had such an awesome restaurant hiding inside. Also, it was known for having huge portions which typically means to me that the food is going to be just ok.\n\nI was totally wrong.\n\nThe restaurant itself is actually very nice compared to the rest of the casino. It's really spacious and clean, and they play AWESOME music. Also, aside from your average orange juice, they offer tangerine juice. WHO ELSE DOES THAT!? No one, that's who.\nMy boyfriend and I were already loving it just from those two things. \n\nFor breakfast I ordered the Tractor combo which I got with two over easy eggs, sausage and the Brown Sugar Banana pancake.\nThat's right. This was no boring old plain whatever pancake with some bananas sliced on top. \nThis was a HUGE effing pancake with a beautiful crust of brown sugar goodness with at least two whole bananas cooked into the massive cake. OMFG.\nDrool. \nThe delicately flavored moist and fluffy cake gently embraced the bananas as they were surrounded by delicious little pockets of crunchy brown sugar. I was a little closer to heaven with each bite. \nThe eggs and sausage were also stellar, perfectly cooked with surprisingly very little grease. I was very impressed.\n\nMy boyfriend chose the Man vs. Food favorite which was a ridiculous benedict of mashed potatoes and biscuits topped with fried chicken, scrambled eggs, mozzarella cheese and some veggies covered with a chipotle cream sauce. It was HUGE. Definitely the Frankenstein's monster of benedicts if I've ever seen it.\nIt was also very tasty though. The chicken was delicious, again surprisingly not greasy at all. Especially for fried chicken. The chipotle cream was flavorful with a good amount of heat and all the veggies were super fresh. \n\nThe service was also spectacular. Our waitress was super friendly and our food was brought out very promptly, even though she told us that our dishes may not come out at the same time. She told us they don't use heat lamps so they want everything to be served right when it comes out so it gets to you nice and hot. That is fine with me! \nThis place definitely deserves all 5 stars. Great service, fantastic ambiance, amazing food and HUGE portions. \nI will for SURE be coming back to this place as soon as I can. \nI would even drive all the way out to Vegas again just to come to the Hash House, it's that good. Next time I HAVE to try the Chicken & Bacon Waffles. \nYes. They have bacon waffles. \nOMFG.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QbmcCE_cLq4WO8ZMKImaLw"}

It's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. The restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nThe menu is simple. Miso, Tonkatsu, or Shoyu ramen. My favorite is...all of them. Huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  I seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. They give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, green onions, half boiled egg, and kikurage. Its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nAnother favorite is their pork belly bowl. Its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. You get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. Its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. We always get a small bowl and share it.\n\nTheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee fried rice. We need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that Monta is known for.\n\nIts easy to over order food at Monta.

Had it been warmer weather, I'd have opted for the Tonkatsu-Shoyu Ramen, a bit lighter with the mix-in of chicken-flavored Shoyu broth.  \n\nI could do without the pricey upsell of add-ons, but I still highly recommend them, especially the soft-boiled egg, corn, and seaweed.  You may end up spending nearly 10 bucks on ramen, but it's still a better choice than anything at Grand Lux", "type": "review", "business_id": "DjOxXobyGDwWt89q4z1twg"}

My husband got the combination Tonkatsu and Shoya and it was just as yummy as my dish. It is interesting how many variations there are of ramen and how adding one ingredient changes the whole dish. \n\nMonta really is a hole in the wall restaurant because it could easily be missed in the shopping center.

We put our name in and take the chance to drive to Aliante and return in time for brekafast.  It did take 45 minutes but they already called our name - we did call them to ask that they move our name lower - they refused ...bummer.\n\nso we get back t Babycakes - another 30 minutes .\n\nWe order the Rick's adobo rice , the pork bennie and we dshared a small stack of the red velevet pancakes.  Service was good - timely refills, food came out reasonably fast.\n\nThe food ?  mixed bag - the gf's adobo rice - i didn't notice on the menu - it's an omelet filled with fried rice.  I like the creativity but didn't quite get there on taste - i kinda laughed since it reminded me of an occasional sunday breakfast for me - take your leftovers from the night before and jam it into an omelet.\n\nThe pancakes were tasty - didn't need the whipped cream - again, a creative dish.\n\nthe pork bennie  - again, i like the creativity and i did like the saltiness of the pork mixed with the egg but it definitely needed more bernaise sauce  and the potatoes ??  for such a creative menu, the potatoes SUCKED ! \n\nI have another groupon so i'm sure i'll hit  Babycakes again but not sure if it's travel worthy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LCeF1wK5OqP3PPEVBa5Xfw"}

Highly regarded on Yelp! and reported to be committed to local high quality ingredients the small shop was a brief detour and, honestly, how often do I have a car at my disposal in Las Vegas?  Opening at 7am we woke early, loaded the car, and arrived at the restaurant at 7:05 - so early the coffee hadn't even finished brewing.\n\nEntering the restaurant we were greeted sleepily by a young Hispanic woman at the front and seated by a young Hispanic man who would also act as our server throughout the meal.  With water poured menus were delivered and once coffee and tea were optioned for we were told it would be a few moments as water was still boiling and coffee still brewing.  Low on d\u00e9cor we sat back and watched highlights of DeSean Jackson lighting up the Giants on the plasma screen until the young man returned with beverages and took our orders.\n\nWith quality service throughout the meal - coffee refilled frequently and water never empty - we watched the restaurant slowly fill to half capacity while we waited...and from my vantage point I watched the kitchen, a two man operation running the griddles and grills with great speed and skill.  With the time just shy of 7:30 our plates would arrive - each warm, well prepared, and accompanied with appropriate toppings in small plastic cups.\n\nThe first plate, ordered by my sister, was the short stack of Peanut Butter and \"make your own combination!\" pancakes - in her case banana and chocolate.  Served with maple syrup the pancakes were decent but not spectacular - a mild peanut butter taste within and chopped bananas and chocolate chips atop.\n\nMy aunt's selection, a short stack of Red Velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream and chocolate crumbles and served with cream cheese syrup would fare better than my sister's choice, albeit largely only because of the syrup.  Cocoa tinged, thin, and somewhat crisp on the exterior the pancakes themselves were tasty while the addition of the chocolate crumbles lent some textural variation and the whipped cream was expectedly sweet.  In the cup, imagine a mildly citrus cream cheese frosting thinned out - a great idea that worked nicely on both this dish and my selection.  As we'd be dining on Red Velvet pancakes for the next two days I feel obligated to note that these were the worst of the group by a large margin.\n\nFor my choice, Carrot Cakes - certainly the most interesting of our pancake selections with shredded carrots and pecans studding the batter.  Topped with more crumbled pecans and the same lovely syrup served with the red velvet options I actually enjoyed my short stack quite a bit and was glad I'd opted for less food so I could sample some of my mother's choice - the best of the meal.\n\nTitled Honey Toast and described as \"two pieces of thick sliced honey toast dipped in a farm fresh egg wash and cooked to perfection! Then drizzled with sweet honey. Yummy!\" I will have to agree with Babycake's assessment - they were prefect and yummy.  Significant in size and heft the two thick slices of toast were perfectly caramelized on the exterior and custard within while the slowly melting whipped cream and honey proved to be a smooth and sweet balance without being overly saccharine.  While superfluous, I will note the house syrup was actually quite good - it reminded me of the Sweet Syrup at Camellia Grill in New Orleans.\n\nSettling the modest bill - a mere $7.50/each with tax and tip - at the front before making our way to the car we were bid farewell and told to come back soon.  While I'll admit that in retrospect I rather wish we'd have simply gotten some pastries for the road, I certainly did not dislike Babycakes - it just wasn't worth the special trip.  While the small caf\u00e9 would be well suited for a city like Columbus or Toledo, given the quality of the competition in Las Vegas it just doesn't stack up, even if the price is a steal compared to options on the strip - I'd much sooner venture to Hash House a Go Go (on strip or off.)", "type": "review", "business_id": "LCeF1wK5OqP3PPEVBa5Xfw"}

It has to be sticky calrose rice, not hard, dry Uncle Bens!  \n\nOverall, this place was decent.

I love the unique pancakes this breakfast place offers.  Carrot cake pancakes, red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, and many more!  I was fortunate to try both the red velvet and carrot cake pancakes...YUM!  I had the Huntington Omelet both times (without the bacon) which had just cheese, avocado, and salsa served with country-style potatoes.  Good, but not extraordinary.  Coffee and OJ are average, but also good.  There are other unique items on their menu such as the adobo fried rice omelet (adobo fried rice wrapped in an \"egg burrito\") which my hubby liked.  Menu does not include many options for non-meat eaters (like myself), but there is a create-your-own omelet option.  \n\nService was not really good the first time (I got my pancakes after I was almost done with my meal...my hubby got his pancakes with this meal), but the second time was better.  The owner even came around to check on us.  Tables are tiny (if ordering pancakes plus meal, the plates don't fit!) so it's almost better to go as a three-or more party to get a bigger table...or to ask for one of the high tables, which look a little bigger.  \n\nAfter the first visit, I was reluctant to try them again.  But thanks to some coaxing from a friend, I decided to give them another chance.  Although this is not my favorite breakfast place, I would still go back to try more of their unique pancake creations and to support a local Filipino business. \n\nI'm hoping each time I try it, I'll like it better and rate it better.

We got seated quickly and service was quick. Right away someone took our drink order and also brought our daughter a kids menu and crayons (that was very important).

I've had this before at other restaurants and they get thumbs down, but Babycakes does it right. The Kalua Pig-shredded pork has a nice smokey flavor and not too salty is served on a toasted English muffin, topped w poached eggs, and a nice hollandaise sauce (they don't slather it on...It was just on the eggs). They also put a bit of sauteed cabbage on the tender Kalua pig which added a nice crunch. You might think to yourself \"Why cabbage?\" In Hawaii we grew up eating a dish called Kalua Pig and Cabbage, it was an easy and delicious home cooked meal. This a favorite in my book.\n\nI saw the person next to me order the Loco Moco and i wanted to reach over and snake a bite from him. But, my wife said don't do it.

It takes a lot, something like red velvet pancakes, to make me venture out into another part of town. The possibility of trying red velvet pancakes made my friends and I wake up at 8 am on Presidents Day, drive about 40 minutes to Summerlin, and wait 45 minutes to get a table.  Despite all of that, I would do it all over again just to get a taste of those wonderful pancakes.\n\nMy two girlfriends and I shared these three menu items:\n\nRed Velvet Pancakes - yes, it lives up to the hype. The full stack came with 6 pancakes. The pancakes tasted like flat cupcakes and they are to die for. It was the right amount of sweetness. You may expect the whipped cream, chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup to be overwhelming but everything was just right.\n\nRick's Adobo Fried Rice - Adobo chicken is a traditional Filipino dish so my expectations were a little high on this dish. It came with fried rice with shredded chicken wrapped in egg like an omelet. It was very tasty and flavorful. We didn't really dig the macaroni salad. Someone was a little too liberal with the pepper.\n\nSpam Scramble - this was the only dish we didn't care for. It tasted as simple as it sounds... Spam with scrambled egg. I guess we just expected something different. This was something anyone could make at home and make it better.\n\nIf I were only rating the red velvet pancakes, I would give Babycakes Caf\u00e9 5 stars, hands down. I love the pancakes so much that I would make the drive out there again on my day off just to get a taste of them again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "LCeF1wK5OqP3PPEVBa5Xfw"}

Well then, Babycakes Cafe is for you!  The owners of Babycakes are some mighty nice PILIPINO (I say it like my nanay) people!  Have you eaten yet?\n\nBabycakes is packed in the morning especially on weekends because they are only open for breakfast and lunch up until around 2 PM!  So if you can get over your \"What happens in Vegas...stays in Vegas\" hangover get here early!  If you get to Babycakes at prime dining time be prepared for a bit of a wait.  But it's ok because it's worth it.\n\nWe meandered here on a Furlough Friday for us and intended not to spend any money of this day of no pay.  Boy was that a mistake!  We 'accidentally' pulled into the parking lot just to see what the crowd was like.  Once that smell of pancakes and grilled goodies hit me I couldn't help it.  We got out of the car and walked in.  Thankfully, no wait!\n\nI just couldn't keep myself from looking around the dining area and checking to see if I was related to anyone in the place!  So bad...I know!  So many Asian people around me...like I was at a Wow-Wow-Wee taping!  Or a Journey concert with Alan Pineda as the lead singer!  Alas, there was no relatives of mine within the vicinity.\n\nOn to checking out the Babycakes Cafe menu.  Lots of familiar breakfast choices.  Babycake pancakes, favorites, omelettes, benedicts, crepes, all kinds of good stuff!  We ended up ordering the Baby Chick omelette with chicken, mushrooms, spinach, garlic, and cheddar cheese ($9.50), the Two-Egg Breakfast with two eggs, and hashbrowns ($6.25), and a short stack of their famous Red Velvet babycakes ($5.75).  Both of our orders each also came with two buttermilk babycakes included!  Not too shabby!  \n\nThe food?  Delicious!  The omelette was fluffy and had a good amount of fillings, the eggs were cooked great (sunny side up..yum) and my hashbrowns were the way I like em'...super crunchy!  The babycakes were excellent as well, buttery and light.  But damn...those Red Velvet babycakes?  They were pretty bomb!  Topped with whipped cream and chocolate chips?  It was like having dessert for breakfast!  So savory!  Didn't even need the cream cheese syrup.  I will be sure to order a FULL stack of these next time!  And probably not share, ha ha!\n\nBabycakes Cafe also has some stuff on the menu that is definitely Asian/Filipino/Hawaiian inspired.  These guys serve Spam!  Oh yeah!  The king of meats in Hawaii!  Definitely feelin' like I'm home.  Babycakes also has a Kalua Pig Benedict which definitely rings in the islands.  Don't forget Loco Moco!  It's made there too.  They serve Asian inspired Honey Toast!  Japan would be proud!  One of Babycakes biggest specialty sellers is Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.  I wish I had ordered it because it looked so yummy!  Steaming hot with a side of macaroni salad included, all I needed was to top it off with ketchup, shoyu, and Tabasco.  Breakfast nirvana I say!\n\nWe'll be going here again soon.  Food was good, service was good, atmosphere is good.  I heard on the grapevine that the members of Jabbawockeez and Super Cr3w frequent Babycakes Cafe quite a bit and they love it!  I didn't see any of them in there the time we visited...but then again, how would I know what the Jabbawockeez guys look like without their white masks on?\n\nGo here for a good breakfast!  It's the most important meal of the day!  If I remember correctly, the lady owner of Babycakes Cafe was super duper, mighty fine lookin', very pretty lady!  Friendly too.

The cheese was great and had a nice tang.   Bread could have been crispier on the outside but that's a personal preference.  Have to say...I'm craving one right now.\nPepperoni slices were nice too.  This place cooks until the cheese is just melted.  I can see how other people have had underdone pizzas since they don't blast their pies, but mine was perfect.  The crust was a little crispy and chewy.  I'd say the crust at Metro Pizza is still way better.  But that's an almost perfect crust unless you compare that to the really high end pizza places like Mozza in LA.  The pepperoni tasted just like a nice pepperoni you'd get at the store.

People like Biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses. Great food. Personal service. Owners who aren't happy until you're happy.\n\nIt was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.\n\nWhen we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.\n\nLong story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.\n\nWith our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.\n\nIt goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity! (I'll be sure to supplement that with my own order of Chicken Wings).\n\n5 stars", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

For reference I've traveled to NYC many, many times, I lived in Chicago for awhile, I've spent a month in Italy and pizza is my favorite food on earth. If I know anything, it's pizza!! I have never been as disappointed in a slice as I was here. \n\nI do laugh when I read Vegas yelper complaints about brick oven places having \"burnt\" pizza. In NYC, many order their pizza extra well done and relish in the beautiful black bubbles that a true NYC pizzeria coal fired oven delivers. The crust here was the most bland tasteless cardboard crust I've ever had. I like crust with flavor and this crust had none. It wasn't chewy, it wasn't crispy, it was just blah. \n\nI thought Metro had the greasiest cheese in town until I tried Biaggio's. I've attached a picture of the disgusting pool of orange that oozed out of every bite. I know some are way into the whole grease thing, but I am not. If you're the type that wants neon orange grease dripping down your arms, this is your place. \n\nIn fairness, I did order the lunch special (2 slices and drink for around 5 or 6 bucks), so perhaps the pizza just doesn't reheat well and I should have ordered a fresh pie? Definitely hands down the most tasteless greasy pizza I've ever had (yup, I'm including Sbarro and Little Caesar's in that!).

The  man said oh really went behind the counter and got onto his staff the man's name was the owner \"Biaggio\" he then returned to the man and stated that his order would be right out, when his order came out Biaggio went to the cash register and returned his money and gave him the order for free....Talk about service WOW!!

Biaggio at Biaggio's Pizzeria has set out to ensure that all of his customers get just that.  \n\nWe are getting married in Vegas this February and I contacted Biaggio after reading all of the awesome Yelp reviews.  Biaggio's enthusiasm was so infectious on the call that I couldn't help but decide to have the reception with this pizzeria without even consulting my other half.  \n\nBiaggio kept using these seductive words like \"stromboli\", \"lasagna\", and \"cannoli\" to name a few.  We decided to have a second phone discussion after I actually told my fiance about the reception so that we could finalize the menu.  Unfortunately....I forgot to call!\n\nNo worries, I called the restaurant and the next morning when he got the message, Biaggio called me right away.  Then he gave me his cell phone number so that I would never miss him again.  It turns out he is only ever out of the pizzeria on Tuesday nights from 6:30pm on, so I could probably catch him there...nonetheless, he wanted me to be able to get hold of him at all times.  That's what I call commitment to customers!  \n\nAfter this discussion, we finalized our menu.  We are starting with three kinds of stromboli --pastrami, chicken & artichoke, and meatball & garlic as well as a salad that will include roasted tomatoes, artichokes, olives, and three kinds of cheese (amongst other tasties).  The main course will include lasagna, garlic knots, and sausage & peppers.  I'm not sure we will still have space for dessert, but just in case, we ordered cannoli, donuts, and he is throwing in 4 lbs of cookies that his friend who makes the cannoli's makes for free.  \n\nOn top of the menu, there will be two people to assist with all prep and mealtime issues; the chef will be on hand, and Biaggio himself will be there to help.  He's even shutting the restaurant down from 6pm to 9pm on a Sunday for us.  Talk about service!!!\n\nBiaggio has requested that when we get down to Vegas we stop by to try all of the items that he will be serving, to ensure they are just what we want.  If they aren't, he assures me he will switch them out with something we do like.  \n\nThis man and this pizzeria have impressed me beyond measure--and I haven't even tried the food yet!  Anyone with this level of commitment to his business and who speaks of his food in such glowing terms is someone I want to do business with.  \n\nAfter the reception I will do an additional review on the food.  If it's even half as impressive as Biaggio himself, I'm 100% sure it will be a 5 star review.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

We had a pizza with sausage and ham, a meatball sub, and the fried dough for dessert.\n\nThe service was great, the young lady and young man were very attentive; they checked up on us several times. We met Biaggio as well, he was very friendly and checked up on us also to make sure everything was cooked properly. Service was A+.\n\nAs for the pizza...crust had nice texture. It was crisp enough on the bottom to hold up to the toppings but still soft enough in the middle to fold and provide a nice chew. You won't get the smoky slightly charred crust from a coal fired brick oven which I personally love (since some yelpers have wondered about the oven), but you will get a nice thin crust pizza with a good bite to it. A previous yelper had said the cheese was too greasy, but it was fine in my opinion. Perhaps it did make a difference that he didn't have a whole fresh pie. I liked the sausage quite a bit, the ham was good but nothing special as far as I could tell. I found the sauce to have a nice flavor to it, it was fairly zesty and not too sweet like some other pizzerias. This is just MY personal preference, but I like my sauce to be slightly thicker or more paste-like than the sauce on the pizza here. However, if I had to choose only one between taste or thickness I'd still choose taste. Overall, definitely one of the best pizza options in Summerlin. Plus they deliver! \n\n*On a side note, I noticed one of the yelpers on here was talking about not being able to get delivery on football Sundays. Funny, cuz I talked to Biaggio about that when I was there. I also order pizza almost every Sunday during football season. Biaggio said he would be able to parbake the pizza and deliver it on Saturday. Since the parbaked pizza would only be half cooked, you would be able to finish the baking process on Sunday and have a fresh baked pie right out of the oven. Seems like a fair solution to the store not being open on Sundays.\n\nAh, the meatball sub. I have to say it's probably the best meatball sub I've had since I moved here several years ago. They get their rolls from a local bakery here in town and they make their own meatballs. Using a nice blend of beef, pork, and veal along with a healthy dose of garlic equals winning recipe for meatballs in my book!\n\nWhen it was time for dessert I asked about the zeppole and Biaggio explained it to me. Unfortunately he was out of the raspberry dipping sauce which he said just elevates the dessert to another level. So he recommended we try that next time when he has the sauce. Instead, he offered the fried dough which was served warm with a quick basting of butter and dusting off cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar. This was a really nice dessert, the dough wasn't too heavy and it was slightly salty and slightly sweet. We enjoyed it very much. To top it off, Biaggio gave us the dessert for free since we weren't able to have the zeppole with raspberry sauce. How nice is that?\n\nI was told the star item of the restaurant is the pastrami stromboli. I LOVE pastrami, so I'll definitely be going back and trying that!", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

It had little pieces of roasted garlic on it that just brought the pizza to the next level. \n\nMy friend had the combination pizza and said it was good.

She was quick and friendly. While waiting for our order, Biaggio chatted us up about his pizza.  We didn't order pizza but he insisted we try it so he gave us a couple slices.  OMG it was good.  I've been so disappointed with pizza lately that I've pretty much given it up.  My pizza strike is now over.\n\nFirst we had the garlic knots, so good.\n\nThen Biaggio brings out a few wings for the hubby to try, he enjoyed them very much.  The ranch and the blue cheese dressings are both homemade. Very tasty.\n\nI ordered the cheese steak, it was delicious.  Cheesy and full of onions and the meat was tender and flavorful. Hubby had the baked ziti and loved it. Biaggio brought him out a meat ball that was also delicious.\n\nOur three year old, who is extremely picky said it was the best place ever.\n\nFor dessert, we had zeppole. wow, I'd never had it before but it was doughy, sugary little bites of heaven and the raspberry dipping sauce was amazing.\n\nThe value for the price is great. The portions are huge and the service is great. We will certainly be back soon and often", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

He was very polite and told me that the next meal was on the house. \n\nNow, the food: The salad was fine. No complaints about quality. The pizza was fine too. It's hard to be objective about pizza. I didn't prefer their pizza, as I like a thinner crust and crispier texture. But there was nothing \"wrong\" with it. The flavor was good, and the blend of cheeses was nice as well.\n\n I would advise others to try it. You can't beat the price, and the customer services was above average for Las Vegas.

The salad that Biaggio made for us was a great combination of classic italian ingredients mixed with some of his own personal flair - The artichokes and dried tomatoes turned a good salad into a great one.  The stromboli was cooked to perfection, and the trio of meatball, pastrami, and chicken/artichoke covered the spectrum very well (though a veggie-only one might have been a good experiment as well).\n\nThe lasagna, though, completely blew my mind.  The sauce was rich and flavorful, the mozzarella was CLEARLY fresh, and the meatballs were spiced to perfection.  I would be a very large man if I had the chance to eat this every day.\n\nThe cannoli capped the evening out with a crisp, delicious shell and a cream that was surprisingly light.  Perfect way to end an evening.\n\nThe staff's energy was what truly gave this the last half star, though - Like I said before, Biaggio was engaging and informative during the whole dinner, and he really seems to pour his soul into the food he's making.\n\n\nI should clarify - I'm not sure what the full extent of his daily menu is.

Mr. Biaggio is one of the nicest restaurant owners you'll ever meet in your life and is not happy until his customers are satisfied and in my opinion, all restaurant owners should strive to follow in his footsteps.  \n\nI ordered 2 slices of pizza and a large soda for $6 which is the BEST deal in town. The sausage was very flavorful and the pizza was awesome overall, especially for the price. \n\nI also tried the meatball and 'gravy' and that was probably the best meatballs I've had in my life, and I'm pretty picky with meatballs. The meatballs were so good, that I had to inquire details since they were so phenomenal. Mr. Biaggio informed us that the meatball and sauce is a family recipe and the bread is cooked fresh daily. So if you're going to Biaggio's, you MUST order a meatball sub if not on your first visit, then definitely your second.\n\n5 stars all around, Biaggio's just gained some regular customers!.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

The first 2 times were quite good and I would've definitely recommended them to our friends & family. The owner was friendly and was very welcoming on both occasions. The 3rd and now our 4th time ordering and I'd be hard pressed to go back or recommend them to anyone.\n\nThis time we ordered a pizza with mushrooms & ricotta cheese. When I arrived to pick it up I looked at the pizza and voiced my concern that the lack of mushrooms was disappointing and the same thing had happened previously on our 3rd order. The guy at the counter said \"I'll write it down\" as if that was going to take care of anything with the immediate situation. I was rather puzzled by his response but didn't feel like arguing with him about what good customer service was and how he should've handled the situation.\n\nAfter arriving home from a quick 5 minute drive we found our pizza to be an undercooked cheesy swamp and as noted before a distinct lack of mushrooms. The pizza was impossible to eat in any normal sense of the word and wouldn't even stand up to the folded NY style of eating a slice. I've attached 2 pictures, bad iPhone shots, showing our pizza and what it looked like prior to and after trying to remove a slice after using a knife to re-cut it.\n\nWe were very disappointed as we really liked the flavor of their sauce and the ingredients. Even though it's priced quite high for pizza we would've been regular customers but if you can't get the order right, or cooked properly, I'll spend my money elsewhere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

This place is AWESOME!!! Everything about this restaurant is 5+++++++ Stars! From the exceptional front line service of Mr Biaggio and his daughter all the way down to the ingredients that he uses, you can tell Mr Biaggio takes his restaurant seriously. We really enjoyed being able to meet and chat with Mr Biaggio himself! What a great guy to take the time to get to know and meet his customers! Between the two of us, we ordered the garlic knots, chicken parm sub, and a small supreme pizza. There are no words that can express how delicious the food is here. All I can say is that you must visit Biaggio's Pizzeria when you're in the area to understand exactly what I mean. You can most certainly feel and taste the love and pride that goes into all of the food made here. The ingredients that he uses are of fine dining quality and his recipes are authentic. I will now review the 3 items that we ate. \n\nGarlic knots: \n\nTo die for!!! These garlic bread knots have the perfect crusty outside with a soft and chewy middle. The garlic knots are complemented with a marinara sauce that is perfect in consistency, texture, and flavor. We were shocked when Mr Biaggio told us that he does not use salt in his marinara sauce. The medley of spices and herbs that he uses in his sauce make up for the absence of salt. The garlic knots are buttery with the perfect amount of garlic used. He also uses real shredded Parmesan cheese to top the garlic knots and not the cheap, powdery stuff that comes out of a can. \n\nChicken parm sub: \n\nThe bread used for this sandwich is fabulous! Mr Biaggio told us that the bread he uses for his sandwiches are made by an older Italian gentleman who has been making bread for years! One bite into the bread and you can taste the years of experience that went into making the bread. The crust is perfectly crusty with a soft and chewy middle. The taste is perfect. You can tell that the bread maker is a master of his craft. The chicken inside the sub is plentiful and has a perfect balance of seasoning. Once thing that we noticed about his chicken parm sandwich that is different from others is that he cuts up the chicken into bite size pieces which makes eating this sandwich easy and quite pleasurable. And of course, as I mentioned above, the marinara sauce used in this sandwich was perfect and complemented the sandwich well. \n\nSmall supreme pizza: \n\nSmall!!? This pizza was quite large for a \"small size\". The toppings he used were plentiful and of superb quality. The amount of sauce and cheese used was perfect. The pizza's crust was quite tasty and enjoyable all the way to the crust. There is a perfect balance of the amount of toppings and sauce that he uses because the pizza was not a soggy mess like some other pizza's that flop and sag. Our pizza was quite enjoyable down to the last bite! \n\nIn summary, Mr Biaggio and his daughter go out of their way to make you feel at home. Their warm and friendly disposition make you feel as if you are eating in their families home. The food here is amazing and very plentiful. The prices here are low and very affordable. The quality of the food is of fine dining caliber without the high prices and the recipes used here are authentic and perfected. Our whole experience here was a 5++++++ Star one and we will definitely be back next year for more. Would I recommend eating here? Are you kidding me? YES! YES! YES! You will not be disappointed! The only bad thing about eating at Biaggio's for us is that now since we do not live in Vegas, we'll have to wait a whole year till we can have more! Eating Italian food anywhere else will not be the same for us now that we know how Italian food is supposed to taste like thanks to Mr Biaggio! Mahalo(Thank you in Hawaiian) Mr Biaggio for an outstanding dining experience!", "type": "review", "business_id": "fSs0EdKmLJ7VULejtsi9CQ"}

I take back my previous statement that the owner is friendly. Biaggio contacted me after my review and asked for a chance to prove himself. Okay, I thought, why not give him another chance. So I called and placed the same order I did the first time and told him who I was. When I arrived to pick up my order, he asked that I not post on Yelp what he was doing to fix my previous visit should I happen to change my review. I said that I would not. Then he proceeded to tell me that he didn't open his business to be a 2- or 3-star business and that \"wasn't the service\" I got there. To me, that basically means he is calling me a liar, and I told him so. He denied this. I told him that I used to work at a pizza place and that isn't how you do business. He said that he had nothing to offer me besides the garlic knots. I told him that I ordered enough food that night for my family to eat dinner and that  we ended up hungry because he was busy and all he gave me that night was a shrug and said, \"We're out.\" He again said that it didn't happen, and that's when I got even more mad. I told him I would never be back again. \n\nYou don't ask for a second chance to prove yourself to a customer and then when he comes in call him a liar and hint that you would like him to change his review and add more stars. That's not how you do business, especially if you think you are providing 5-star service. Whatever happened to \"The customer is always right?\" When did it become \"The customer is a liar if he says he had bad service?\"  All he had to do when I came in was say, \"I'm sorry you had a bad experience. I hope this one was better,\" and I would have been a returning customer. As it is, I will never go back.

So why just one star?\n\nWell...  When I go somewhere that specializes in burgers, I'd expect the burger to be great, at least good...  I would have even settled for mediocre...  Instead, it was easily the worst burger I have ever had...  I'd take McDonald's over this (I hate McDonald's), and for the price I could have had McDonald's 10 times over.  \n\nSo how bad was it?  Well...  Ever had a burger that was cooked on charcoal before all the butane finished burning off?  Well... this was worse.  This was kind of like directly eating that charcoal...  So maybe I just got unlucky with that ONE burger?  No such luck, because the waitress took it back, exchanged it for another, DIFFERENT burger, and it was almost as bad.  At this point, I am not sending it back again because I certainly don't want them to spit in it.\n\nI really wanted to like this burger.  Hell, I wanted to LOVE it.  The descriptions and promised flavors were so enticing...  But all I could taste was burnt charcoal.\n\nThe waitress said that some people are extra sensitive to the charcoal flavor, but my friend had the same bad experience.  Besides... this is the first and only time I have ever experienced a burger like that. \n\nIf I ever go back to Cosmo, I might have a shake there, but never another burger.  What a waste.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

It has a delicious, juicy patty, egg, kimchi, and a spicy mayo. DISCLAIMER.... NOT A FIRST DATE FOOD. Only for those who are in love and have no problem getting a little messy for your partner.... or if you're just going out with friends. Besides the mess... wow its a good burger. The egg is left a little runny (I spilled it all over the table:[). The kim chi and the spicy mayo blended perfectly together. I ate the whole thing without regret. \n\nMy boy got the burger with brisket on it.. I forget what it was called, but we didn't talk much during our meal because we were busy stuffing our faces. I looked up once after finishing my half, and his was gone! \n\nWe opted out on the shake, but we did get the \"Candy Store\" plate. It was pretty fun, but I prefer a bigger, more unified dessert. It had a mini dessert, and allowed your mouth to sample a variety of sweets. Pineapple/coconut tapioca (mmm), custard donut with coffee/chocolate syrup for dipping, mystery fruit jellies, chocolate custard push-pop, a mini chocolate dipped ice cream cone with banana ice cream, and the most exciting Nitrogen infused meringues. The waitress was sure to let us know you could blow smoke at your nose while eating them, \n\nThe dessert was fun and different, but I'm not sure I would recommend it for the price. \n\nMy experience at Holstein's leaves me with the impression of being able to return... but only on occasion as it is kinda pricey.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

Although I usually like ordering specialty cocktails at places like this, I noticed that they had bubble-gum vodka (one of my favorites) so the bartender made me a  bubble-gum martini that was delicious! It was pink and girly...definitely what I was in the mood for. \n\nFor food I had the duck 'street tacos'. I love anything and everything with duck, but then add foie gras, and truffle cream and stuff it into a crispy tortilla? yuuummmm! \n\nAlso ordered the Lobster Mac-n-cheese. Its a perfect size portion (so you can eat it all and be guilt-free). I just happen to be a mac-n-cheese connoisseur, so I've had my share of cheesy noodles. This one is really good with the lobster and truffle cream, but not my favorite. However the dish comes with a mini lobster BLT that is so good I would definitely order it again. (You can only get this little mini blt with the mac, it's not a menu item on its own). \n\nHolsteins is a cool hang-out spot.

Didn't have a burger! Instead, had drinks, \"appetizers\" (turned out to be plates bigger than appetizers) and desserts. The classic martini was terrific, I got the GIN variety (does no one drink gin in this town?), containing a gin of which I had never heard (\"Nolet Silver\"?) which was floral and smooth, garnished with pickled shallot. (Expecting shallot bulbs on a stick, instead it was shaved in the bottom of the glass!) Another had a\"bloody mary\", which came \"up\", containing pepper/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it! Food was \"fried pickles\" (fried dill spears, fried olives, caper berries, prosciutto, salami w/ herb-caper mayo), \"street tacos\" (crispy shells filled w/ shreds of duck confit, foie gras, trufle crema & cranberry relish), \"truffle lobster mac n cheese\" (maine lobster, black truffle & mac in a tallegio-marscapone sauce), and \"Bull's Balls\" (2 risotto rice balls stuffed with veal, topped with \"tomato fondue\" and a slice of lardo). A very rich, decadent collection of dishes, I thought all were very well done, especially the mac (WOW!). The \"Bulls' Balls\" weren't as good as I had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the \"tomato foudue\", which was genius. (An angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) The \"street tacos\" were really good but really rich. My fave thing on the \"fried pickles\" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). Ended with a \"stout float\" (Guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. After food we had a really wacky concoction: \"Johnny Apple Seed\", consisting of Knob Creek, honey and apple cider. First of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what \"hard cider\" was! We had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. No matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! AHEM! But a great idea, IMHO. Sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! So overall, I'd say GO. Now I need to go back for a burger, perhaps that \"duck duck goose\", stuffed with duck confit, duck cracklings & foie gras! YIKES!", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

I love a good burger, and shakes with booze...yes please!! \n\nI was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. Not a problem, that's not unusual. By the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. We were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. Because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. They attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. We quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation. \n\nLobster corn dogs: good, but not great \nFried pickles: extremely tasty! \nLobster mac n cheese: I only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful! \nPhilly steak egg rolls (I think): ehhh \n\nSo far so good...I was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! I kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. I can't complain. I had it with steak fries which were also good. The overall consensus of the group was that the food was good. \n\nSo why the 2 stars? While the food was good, maybe even great, the service was TERRIBLE. Wait, I have to clarify, half of the table's service was terrible. While Pete's side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, Nicole's side of the table had several problems... \n\n1. the birthday girl ordered a classic burger with Cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon, wild mushrooms and NO TOMATOES. What she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. While I acknowledge this was not Nicole's fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! And throughout the whole time Nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates. \n\n2. Someone else ordered a burger (I honestly can't remember which one) with brie and grilled onions. When she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for Cheddar instead. This also took a ridiculous amount of time. \n\n3. Someone ordered a beer that never came \n\nDuring this time another one of our party decided to say something to the Manager, Steve. As soon as we said something to him, he brought the burgers out. He was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. The second burger was supposed to have grilled onions and it didn't, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let Steve now, he immediately said \"Oh no, there are grilled onions on there, I saw them put them on\" Then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on the burger. Obviously Steve was left a little red in the face. To his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. The birthday girl couldn't even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat. \n\nThe duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and I also enjoyed the onion rings. \n\nOh and the server (who's name I didn't catch) who was pouring drinks, then \"tying his shoes\" while we talked to the manager...you're not slick dude.  We know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn't you we were complaining about.\n\nWhat is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "BqrTtox0JbG-P_DKBB5bBw"}

My fiance and I chose Holsteins this past Sunday. We arrived at 8pm and the hostesses asked if we had a reservation. We did not, and they weren't seating until 8:45pm without reservations, which is fine, so we went to another fine Block 16 Hospitality establishment across the street--Pinks--as we were in a hurry. \n\nAfter eating our delicious hotdogs, we went back to the Cosmopolitan and asked the hostesses if we could make a reservation for after the concert we were headed to that evening. They told us that we couldn't make a reservation but it shouldn't be a problem as their last seating was 11:45pm. \n\nFast forward, the concert ended and we hurried over to Holsteins and arrived at 11:30pm. We waited our turn in line and then the hostess informed us that they were no seating. Now I'm upset so I complained and asked for a manager's contact information and instead of giving it to me, they seated me. \n\nThe service by our server, Scot, was TERRIBLE. He was clearly bothered by our late seating, noting upon arriving at the table, \"Well, you guys sure got a late seat\". Not hello. No greeting. Terrible. He took our orders (food and drink) all at once so that we could make it a faster dining experience. My milkshake came out as did our friend's diet coke but my fiance's Miller Lite didn't come and then the food arrived. I asked the runner about the beer and 5 minutes after the food arrived, Scot runs by, slams an unopened can of Miller Lite down on the table and then runs away. He didn't inquire about our food. He didn't open the beer. He was just generally absent from the entire experience and made us feel rushed and unwelcome. \n\nThe food was delicious but overcooked. I asked for my burger, The Gold Standard, rare and received a burger that was tan with a hot pink center. Same for my fiance. Additionally, both of us became violently ill about 2 hours later that evening.

So this time, I did some research. I'll admit, what drew me to Holstein's wasn't really the food...it was the boozy shakes. Drunken Monkey? Yes, please. And that's what I ordered, which turned out to be delicious beyond my comprehension. Whoever thought to mix banana gelato and Frangelico deserves to be worshipped.\n\nThe food was equally as outstanding. When I ordered my Rising Sun burger \"medium rare to rare,\" my server warned, \"The rare is cold and red, while the medium rare is warm and red. Would you prefer it warm or cold?\" And so I ordered it medium rare. And out it came, warm and red and juicy Kobe beef. I was shocked that for once I didn't have to overcompensate in my ordering just to get a decent amount of pink in my burger. The toppings were perfect (you can't not love tempura avocado, really), and even the teriyaki glaze, which I was skeptical of, wasn't overpowering. The shoestring fries that accompanied it were great, especially with a side of truffle mayo.\n\nOn top of everything, our server was excellent and very attentive, which in my experience hasn't been the norm in Vegas restaurants. Holstein's reassured me that there, in fact, IS good food to be found on the Strip, and I will certainly be returning here on my next trip.\n\nUpdate: I FINALLY got back here and had the Gold Standard burger this time. A little overcooked, and not as bold in flavor as the Rising Sun. Also, the fries were thicker and not as crisp--why the change?! I'm not as in love with Holsteins as I used to be, but it's still one of my favorite affordable spots on the Strip.

Nobody was rude to us, our waitress was attentive and everything came out in timely fashion.\n\nDrinks - This is definitely worth 1-2 stars on its own. They make what they call \"adult vitamins\" which are drinks that use Vitamin waters as their bases. Basically Vitamin water plus vodka/gin and some additional fruit juices. I know it sounds like pretty ridiculous but why not?  They were tasty and pleasant drinks after a long day. They were fairly strong. They also offer milk shakes with alcohol...you know you want it!  If I'm ever back at this place, I'll probably try one of these out. \n\nFood - Mostly burgers and variations on the concept. They make a good effort at gourmet or fusion-y type burgers - burgers made of duck, lamb, etc. or with various ethinically inspired toppings.  I appreciate the attempt, but I do think that if your place has the name of a type of cow in its name, you should probably offer at least a handful of beef burgers. \n\nAnyways, I had the \"Classic\" which is a beef patty-based burger with cheese. It was fantastic! Perfectly cooked and juicy. The patty itself maybe had a touch more salt than it needed but when eaten with bread, condiments, and toppings its fine.  The bun was nicely toasted and buttery. The Classic is your standard burger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, and onion.  You can add on varying cheeses or a number of other toppings (fried egg, bacon, mushrooms, beef brisket, etc). \n\nI like the offerings and variety of flavors and palettes this place can appeal to.

Orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.\n\nThe star of this place is the food. The ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. The alcohol milkshakes are amazing. They will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. We tried four different kind that day. The Framboise float was not well balanced. Although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. On the other hand, the campfire smores, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. They had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.\n\nStarting out with the artichoke \"guac\" was unimpressive. In fact, looking back, I cannot remember it as vividly as I do with everything else we ordered.\n\nNow the burgers are spectacular. If you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. My group had our burgers family style to share. We got two gold standards; aged beef, smoked bacon, goat cheese, greens and aioli. They were delicious. The meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with the burger. Next was the captain hook; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. The fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. Now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. The longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey BBQ sauce. This monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. Nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. The duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. When you bite into the succulent patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. The blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. If you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout.

I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and finished it before my friends got half way thru their own.  My burger was the longhorn which comes with coleslaw and brisket on it.  I asked for mustard thinking I would need it, but nope!  The burger was juicy and so full of flavor.  Writing this review makes me want to eat one right now!  Also the size of the burger was great.  It wasn't massive like Red Robin, basically normal size.

Wicked Spoon tries to be a little different and they succeed in many ways. I'm giving them a 5 for now, even though they do have a few issues that will hopefully be ironed out once they are open longer. \n\nBased on reviews from other Yelpers, they seem to still be trying out different things since some of the items mentioned by others were not present when I was there and I'm sure I had some things that others did not have. I ended up eating here twice my last trip. I enjoyed it so much I cancelled my steakhouse reservation to eat at Wicked Spoon again. The items were definitely different on both nights. Even the presentation was different on some of the items. They have a really good cold bar. I ate several of the crab and shrimp cocktails. This is a great place for those who have eaten at all the other buffets and are looking for a change of pace. I lost count of the number of items they offered that you really can't get at any other buffet. While other new buffets try to be more and more extravagant, this one tries to be different. with great results. My favorite item was the blackened lamb ribs. \n\nNow for the areas that need improvement. Service is definitely an issue. The line moves slow, although I think that can be credited largely to the buffet being new and people are still getting used to their jobs. It seems like they will eventually have some self serve kiosks, but they were not being used when I was there. The servers also seem to be overwhelmed. They may want to consider hiring more servers since the nature of this buffet (small plates, pans, baskets, bottles, etc.) generates more that needs clearing. That being said, the service was friendly and very good, if a little slow. The servers seemed really proud to be there though, which is always a good thing. They also need to stock cold plates in the cold bar and dessert sections. The dessert selection is a bit small. I wish they had some little cakes or something. \n\nThe Asian food section is the one that needs the most work right now. It was the weakest section and needs more variety. I'm guessing their chef has very little experience with Asian cuisine since even the simple dishes were messed up. The Korean short ribs, for example, were overcooked and drowning in sauce. The dim sum needs to be made in smaller batches.\n\nMinor quibbles aside, this is a very good buffet. Maybe not as big or as fancy as others, but very good for what it is and the price makes it an awesome value.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

For such an upscale and luxurious casino, you would think that their restaurants have to be top-notch and at their best. Unfortunately, that was not the case when I went.\n\nThe Good: $20 for lunch at a very nice place is not that bad. There was a variety of food, most of which were served in individual plates, which is different compared to most other buffets in Vegas that serve their food in big trays for you to scoop out of. There was a good selection of meats (definitely try the lamb if you can), a small sushi bar, some dim sum, and other kinds of food -- they all varied in excellence. There are unusual foods which I have not seen at other buffets before, one of them being pork belly fat wrapped inside a flour bun. Nonetheless, the food was presented beautifully, just like the decor around the buffet (curly-glass chandeliers and beautiful silverware). The dessert selection was amazing, and it's not like any other dessert selection you see at other buffets. There were macaroons, chocolate slates, mini chocolate-covered apples (each is unique with different toppings), gelato, unusual tarts sitting in egg shells, and chocolate covered strawberries. You can tell that they put a lot of effort into individually making each piece of dessert.\n\nThe Bad: My number one complaint here would be the staff. Although friendly as they were, they were not prepared as they should be, both in terms of handling food AND as waiters. Our waiter approached our table saying, \"My name is uh, ____. *Long pause* I am going to be your server today.\" It seemed pretty obvious he was trying to remember his lines, which should have been perfected before the grand opening of such a high-class casino. Not only that, but he DISAPPEARED after giving us our drinks and NEVER CAME BACK to check up on us or refill our drinks. Our glasses were empty after a while and we had to call on a random staff to refill it for us. As we were eating, we heard a big clash near the kitchen door and found that the same staff member just dropped the tray with our drinks on it. Another clash was heard later on, for another staff had dropped another tray on the floor. Our finished plates literally filled up the entire table before the staff took it away. Also, the place lacked fruits, which I think is essential at a buffet.\n\nOverall: I feel that this buffet has so much potential, but just lacks the proper staffing experience and some food quality/selection at the moment. If you're reading this review in the future, hopefully the staff will be more prepared and the food choices will open up just a little by then. I am a little bit curious myself to see much they will improve in a few months' time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

For 27 bucks for dinner, one of the cheaper gourmet buffet options on the Strip. \n\nWicked Spoon's concept is a buffet tapas thing - everything in small portions on small plates. Unfortunately, there are several problems: one, the stations aren't very clearly labeled. So you have to wander around a bit to figure out the layout and there are a couple of stations I didn't really get. (I THINK it's a make-your-own-Thai-rice-noodle-soup station at the end of the Asian portion.)\n\nThe second problem is that any time you plate several small plates on top of a larger one, they start to slide around as you walk. And it made for stacking the dirty dishes difficult for the waitstaff. Who, coincidentally, are not super amazing at their jobs. I can't IMAGINE what the dishwashing looks like behind the scenes.\n\nOverall, there was a wide range of food options. I enjoyed an udon noodle stirfry, some Korean riblets, and the little shrimp cocktails. Lamb chops in olives and artichoke hearts was a stand out, if they could get some more olive flavor into the meat. We also uniformly enjoyed the sausage in balsamic grilled grapes. (Okay, not exactly sure what this was, wish I'd taken better notes. Sorry Yelp.)\n\nI see that other Yelpers have given the Asian section bad reviews but I honestly thought it was one of the better Asian sections on a buffet in town. Less focus on sushi, and more on regional foods that don't always show up on a buffet line. (Probably because middle America is just getting around to trying it.)\n\nWe didn't like the already-lumped crab. It was chewy and overdone and we all commented that we preferred the mess of shelling it because it usually tasted better. Other misses: lamb ragu with gnocchi. Saffron cod barely tasted saffrony. \n\nDessert was eh, but we didn't have any of the gelato. I did like that they had a bowl of mixed berries - should have stuck to this, a bit of fresh cheese and bread off the salad line and gone with a European dessert. The cheese selection is quite nice for a buffet in this price range.\n\nI hate to feel so mixed.

Wish we had gone here first so that we could have gone back before leaving LV.\n\nIf you are not sure, just try their lunch buffet which is only $19/person.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

The gourmet food was so good that we went back a second time. We would have gone back for Breakfast had our schedule allowed it. Our first meal was on Wednesday at 1pm. The place was not crowded at all. There was a great selection of food. Everything was delicious. \n\nOthers have spoken about the \"individual serving\" sizes being too small. Well you can take as many as you want or go back for more, so I don't see their argument. One point that I would make, however, is that if you just want to taste the ricotta cream spinach or the red wine braised mushrooms you HAVE to take a full serving. Our next meal was on Thursday at 7pm. Again it was not crowded. The selection was very similar to the previous lunch with a few added selections. The spicy crab meat was not overcooked but we did notice some small shell pieces in it.    \n\nThe restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Resort & Casino all the way back in the West End Tower. We easily walked from the Monte Carlo. Taking the crosswalk from City Center over Harmon Ave allows you to enter the resort by the chandelier. If you want to ride the tram, I would say it is just about the same distance from the tram station at the Bellagio as it is from the one at Crystals. The routes from both are convoluted.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

This place feels so fancy-schmancy in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, but you aren't really paying all that much more for great food and beautiful presentation.  For Sunday Brunch, we came here with a party of 7 - It was $23 for Brunch and $30 for Brunch with unlimited Champagne.  I am sure that it is cheaper during the weekdays.  With all the drinking and eating that we've been doing, we decided that it was best to forgo the unlimited Champagne.  \n\nHaving heard that this place just opened nearly a month ago, I was super impressed with their food and the number of patrons.  This place was not easy to find.  The drinks here are massive!  My cup of coffee was the same size as their huge orange juice cups!  Even though it is not unlimited, everyone still got a glass of Champagne as a part of their Sunday Brunch.  I love their portions of food.  I love that the desserts are serves in cute little metal cups - Excellent presentation and choice!  It is nice to know that the food has been untouched by someone else!  Bonus points!\n\nThe dessert section was awesome!  I highly recommend their coffee Gelato Ice cream (There are bits of nuts and toffee in there! MmMm), Strawberry dipped Chocolate (There are toffee in the chocolate and rice crispy covered in white chocolate! mMmMm), and the list can go on and on.  I actually don't recommend their caramel/chocolate dipped mini red apples, but that may be a personal bias as I believe in green apples and white chocolate!  Did I mention that they had fresh Dragon Fruit? MmMm!\n\nBeautiful experience here.  I definitely want to return for their dinner buffet the next time I am in Vegas!  Since this place is still new, I am sure there will be more changes and improvements in the menu!  I can't wait for it!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

It offers bite size portion, which is great because we can almost try \"everything\" in there. The food is not too amazing, in fact, a little too salty for my taste.

They make it upscale, but it's not all that.  There's no flavor at all.  You have tourists, which have lost all there $$ on Gambling.  They feel they should recuperate there losses with eating all the food they can.  They make the portions very small, in little plates (tapas style), but you can only fill 4 items on your plate.  That's a lot of dishes to work with.\n\n\nWell, since I lost so much $, i wanted to eat so I can have some energy to play again.  \n\n1.  SERVICE: Our waiter was not to be seen.  We had to flag down a Manager after 20 mins of dehydration,  once we spoke with the manager, we had prompt response with our drinks, with 2 other waiters.  We still didn't see our waiter for another 30 mins.  Once we did, we actually had to ask for sugar because there was none available for our Ice Coffee and Ice Tea.\n\n2.  PHO STATION: The Soup was not hot and they place the Greens under a food hot lamp.  All the greens were wilted.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??\n\n3.  LABELS:  Most of the dishes have no labels.  You pretty much have to guess what the dish is.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  I thought this salad was with taro, but it wasn't.  I had no idea what that stuff was?  Even their soups, you had to guess.  There were 2 choices of soup, Pho Base or Miso Soup.  of course, they don't label it.  I betcha most of the \"WHITE\" people put the miso soup with the Pho Rice noodles.  that's a major faux-pau in the culinary industry.  Just my opinion.\n\n\n4.  DESERT BAR:  Again, they have no labels next to the items, so you have to guess what the heck it is.  You had to flag down someone behind the bar in order for them to hand you a desert behind the display case.  They should leave that out, if you have to wait there for 5 mins to get a desert.\n\nThey had this Egg custard , in an Egg shell, that Tone recommended, which had different layers of flavors.  I was so intrigued.  So I got one.  But to my dismay, it was just soup.  It was a creamy shot of Blah.. he said it was not made right, since the first time it was made.  it was suppose to be layers, but they did not let the layers set.\n\n5.  RESTROOMS:  They have a very very small restroom for the Buffet.  only 4 people can fit in the bathroom at 1 time.  When I was there, only 1 urinal was available.  so a max of 3 people can be in at one time.  This is okay, but after i finished my meal, the Desert Egg Shell Custard shot did not agree with me.  \n\nAt least I can recommend the Egg custard as a Laxative.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

We got there at right at 5pm with no wait, and the cost was only $27 for dinner. Affordable pricing for such an upscale looking buffet.\n\nI loved how all the food was laid out and there were individual platings of all the sides in cute mini plates or pots. Definitely an A+ for looks. Too bad the taste fell way short.\n\nAt first, I though that it was pretty tasty, but alas I was just too damn starving and distracted by the pretty plates to notice. But after my first plate, I noticed that nothing really stood out. I had no favorites to go back to...and I just ended up trying a little bit of everything. Which is almost IMPOSSIBLE to do.\n\nRemember those cute individual platings? TERRIBLE IDEA! Sometimes I would only want a bite or two, but because I had to take the entire serving, I ended up with a stack of lil plates and pots on my table. I felt super wasteful, but couldn't bear to eat the entire serving because I didn't like it all that much. \n\nPlus those small serving plates avoid you from piling on different things at the buffet creating more than necessary trips back and forth. By then, you just end up getting full before you can get your money's worth. Boo!\n\nThe meats were a little dry, and WHAT...no crab legs?? Instead they had some kinda peeled crab (I THINK) in some butter sauce. Of course I wouldn't really know because nothing is LABELED. But regardless, it was rubbery and weird and tasteless. My favorite thing was the shrimp cocktail, juicy and plump...but it was served in tiny plates of 2 shrimp apiece :\\ Whyyyyyyyyy is life so difficult??\n\nMy favorite part of buffets is always the dessert bar. Again, everything here looks stunning. Miniature works of art. Although looking individual and unique, many of their dessert were similar in form...custard base with a fruit gel. Nothing spectacular. They also have chocolate covered strawberries which I liked, but my favorite was the gelato. The salted peanut flavor was my top pick.\n\nService was also on the slow side. It took the waiter 30 minutes before my coffee came out. By then I already fell asleep from the mediocre food -_-\n\nPretty face, but lacking in quality substance.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Definitely on par with the food at the M buffet. Plus, I didn't have to waste my time getting messy trying to get the crab out of the shell, because it was already done for me. Something, I haven' found at any other buffet.  Also, unlike the M, the wait to get in isn't 3 to 4 hours.\n\nThey also offer a lot of desserts that other buffets don't. Chocolate covered strawberries. Chocolate covered apples [but I wish they were caramel covered]. Crepes. Peanut butter & jelly gelato. Salted peanut gelato. Cute litle mini chocolate cones filled with pudding.  \n\nOn the other hand, the thing I hate most about this place [seems to be the  thing most people love about this place], is the fact that most dishes are served on individual plates or little pots. In most buffets, only the desserts such as cake or pie are served on individual platters. \n\nWhy do I hate this? Simply put - I can't fit as much on my plate. When I go to buffets - my plan of action is to usually get a little bit of a lot of food to kind of feel the place out. Which is, definitely something I couldn't do here. You can only grab about 3 small plates at a time. Which means you have to get up from your table more often. I guess, this could be construed as a good thing - as it provides a little more exercise to negate some of the thousands of calories you will have consumed by the end of the meal. BUT, I like to chill at the table with whomever else I am with and enjoy my food - without having to pause the conversation to get up and get more food every five minutes. \n\nLastly, I've gotten used to the free, unlimited beer/wine/cider offered at the M. So, I was disappointed by the fact that this buffet did not offer the same. But, that could just be me being spoiled. =p\n\nSo, like I said - definitely a love/hate relationship.

There was a Pho station which was nice too, you don't usually see these at buffets. \nI also liked the brussels sprouts, and fingerling potatoes, red wine mushrooms and the pork bun.\nKinda dissapointed that you have to pay $15 extra for king crab legs, i opted out since i wanted to focus on the regular menu items there.\nthey did serve 2 kinds of king crab, (not legs) one in a butter sauce and the other in a bernaise sauce. both were overcooked and rubbery.\nI even tried the new batches they brought out to find the same result :(\nI didnt try the meat carving stations.\nDessert did not dissapoint though, berries cherries all juicy and sweet.\nHuge tasty chocolate strawberries, great Gelato, i tries the pistachio and salty peanut flavors.\n\nI'd go back for sure.\n\nCurrently the M is my favorite buffet but this may take that spot.\n\nBTW if youve got $90 to spend per person check out the sterling buffet at the Ballys! only open 1 day a week but its the Ultimate. top notch shit there", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

I usually go to the Bellagio or Wynn buffet and I usually come back with a FULL plate every time.

The pizzas particularly looked really flat and unappetizing.\n\nI knocked off another star for their desserts. I am a girl and desserts mean everything to me when it comes to meals. No matter how full I am I will always have a FULL plate of desserts. All the stuff they had though was just so....safe and boring and repetitive. Chocolate covered strawberry or apple. Ice cream.

They also had some pretty succulent lamb. I tasted the Crab in butter sauce but I didn't like it . They do make awesome Truffled Mashed Potatoes and the Brussell Sprouts with bacon were delicious. I don't know if it's the heavy sauces and creams that they use but you get full pretty quickly. I was disappointed about that and the fact that I could have taken my husband to the Palace Station Buffet and he would have been happier! \n\nThe dessert was okay but some of it isn't edible it's just for looks. Like the Pink Cheeto looking things were just shaped sugar with no taste. I was only happy with the Chocolate Covered Strawberries. I know they want their food to look stylish but I think it should also taste good! I don't thinks it's impossible ...The Palms used to have these very cute mini pastries that looked cool and were very tasty! \n\nThe food may make you feel bloated and tired. If you plan on eating here I would suggest just making this your meal of the day.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

The walk to the buffet is long and in a strange location.  It feels like walking 2 miles before you reach it.  However, this didn't stop me from going... TWICE.  On Thursday night for dinner we paid $27 it was good but some of the items were stale. The dim sum was atrocious and so was the crab.  Its nice to have the crab shelled for me but shieeeeeeet.  It was dry and rubbery. Sushi was alright too,  i liked how they had the sushi chef making the sushi right next to that station.  Thumbs up for having a mac and cheese station..  AMAZING!  I would say the best items were the pastas and salads.  The deserts were pretty, but tasted okay.  \n\nThe second visit to the buffet was a lot better.  We paid $23 on Saturday for brunch.  Ahhh breakfast foods.. So delish. To die for hash browns, to die for chicken sausage, to die for Guinness pancakes.. yup i said that Guinness pancakes. YUMMMY! Everything on Saturday was fresh and tasty.  The selection was almost identical to dinner minus the breakfast items and lack of crab.\n\nOverall, I think this is one of the better buffets on the strip.  Although it sucks waiting in line. I would suggest going on a weekend.  More people= more food= food doesn't sit for long periods of time.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Everything is presented very well...and MOST of the food was to my liking. I will say that the pork belly in the bun was a bit disappointing...it seems the pork belly wasn't cooked long enough to get that tender texture that you'd find at the good Chinese restaurants. The king crab meat was delicious...but the way it was prepared lacked some flavor.\n\nThe desserts seem never ending! A fudge station...Really great! O...M...G...unlimited chocolate covered strawberries!!! Gelato galore! So many treats to eat...ohhh it was incredible!\n\nThis is an outstanding buffet. However, solely based on food, this is a 4-star buffet. But...we had an incredible server...Josie! In fact, she is the best server I have ever had at ANY buffet! She was on top of it...refills were aplenty and usually before we even asked her (except this one time where she forgot my friend's Coke...and we definitely reminded her throughout the night about that one missed Coke!). Josie was engaging...keeping a spirited and welcomed conversation with us! Josie's sense of humor is what makes the \"Wicked\" in the Wicked Spoon! Josie truly made our Wicked Spoon experience a 5-star extravaganza! You can be sure that when I go back to the Wicked Spoon, I will specifically ask to be seated in Josie's section!!!\n\nSo in summary:\n\nSavory Foods - 4 stars\nDesserts - 5 stars\nDecor - 4 stars\nService - A Zillion stars!", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Very good variety, and lots of Asian menu items.  The deserts including the gelato were exceptional. \nService was very professional and courteous.  Drink refills can be a little slow because they bring you a whole new cup/glass instead of doing refills.  The same for requests for ketchup, hot sauce, etc.(they do not put the bottles on the table, choosing to pour small amounts in a small serving dish which takes longer for your server.  The buffet also features many items on small plates which makes for a cleaner, more sanitary buffet.\nI don't recall the exact prices, but they are cheaper thank Wynn, Aria, and Bellagio.

It's like shopping shoes to me, yes it's nice to have a huge selection but if they are crappy why even bother right. Which brings me to my point why the concept of small individual plates is very appealing to me on a buffet such at The Wicked Spoon. They have delicious and tender meat, the chinese section is surprisingly good and not greasy, the bread selection was also yummy and not hard. and lastly the dessert maybe small in scale compare to the Wynn but was scrumptious and different.

I love love love this place! esp after having dinner at The spice market at Planet Hollywood because then i could compare. \n\nEveryone goes to the buffet in vegas, but obviously not all of them are good. Since this is new, i wanted to try it so bad and it was definitely a great decision! This place is inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel. It's new, it looks very nice and you can tell that they do try to make things very eye-catchy and food at high quality. \n\ni think the most important part of the buffet is the dessert section..to me at least! The dessert section here is amazing, well, compare to wynn and bellagio, they're similar, It's nothing more or special that makes them more superior but it's good enough that i ate till my stomach was about to explode! \n\nThey have almost everything that u can imagine at a buffet here. The best part was of cox the dessert station with all kinds of chocolate barks, chocolate dipped strawberries, YUM!, chocolate dipped mini apples, cakes, tarts, etc. They also have a wide range of gelato flavors, from the simple chocolate to buttered rum. They serve it to you in a cup or a mini cone, your choice, they even have a chocolate waffle cone for you to choose from. Amazing! \n\nAnother thing that's a must try is the mac and cheese station, i fell in love with it and got another round of it even though i was completely full. You basically go there and tell him wat you want in your mac and cheese, you choose ur own cheese (blue, ricotta, or cheddar), type of mac, toppings (lobster, crab, onions, sausage, etc), yum! Other things that i would eat there are the prime ribs, shrimp, salad, this seared salmon with some kind of sauce, forgot the name of it, but it was good! \n\nI just can't think of cons of this place so far. I would definitely go back there again. Oh maybe one of the cons is that the servers are not too bright, we were constantly getting some drinks that we didn't order that was probably from another table, and getting refills for a drink that's not even half empty yet, but not getting refills for a drink that was empty 30 mins ago. Also, the guy at the prime rib station..eh. i can only say he was..nervous?

We walked right in, and got a great seat.  It was busy but not overly crowded.  Our waiter was right there to take our drink orders and to let us know what stations were available. Having survived the 2nd day of CES, I rewarded myself with a mid day cocktail, the Mombo Italiano-- a hand crafted Bloody mary with infused garlic vodka  I'd go back JUST for the drink at 12.00 each. \n\nHere is what sets this particular buffet apart: \n\nThey have, for all of you watching your weight, portioned containers of very interesting food.  With little signs that say how many calories & how many carbs per portion.  Brilliant marketing since there are so many who fail to recognize they have fabulous curves.  I had the Mac & bleu cheese--yum and the wild rice with lamb and goat cheese.  \n\nThe carving stations.  yes multiple.  I could dive head first into the Asian style bbq pork.  It was melt in your mouth.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and made suggestions of what were their favorites.  \n\nI have to say, as I'm writing this realizing the best part of the 2x we've been there, was the staff.  I do like the food selections and the twist with the portioned servings... also made me exercise to walk back up and get another serving... knowing it was 220 calories each.  \n\nI did save room for dessert, a wide selection indeed.  Rice Crispy treats dipped in chocolate? yummo.  \n\nLiving in Vegas, it is only for out of town guests and work that I go anywhere near the strip but last week, with no company and no clients, we opted to actually go to the Wicked Spoon for lunch.

This might account for the 4 star rating, but I'm sticking with it. Haha.\n\nWe came in on a Thursday about 8:45. Not the busiest time of the week, so service was pretty attentive as opposed to the complaints about plates stacking up at the table for long periods of time and drinks going unfilled. I didn't run into any of these problems. This is a new hotel, so obviously there is a grace period where staff has to work out a lot of their kinks, so this could count account for the slower service in the past. \n\nI do agree with many of Yelpers about the tapas style servings being a total waste. I'm sure they'll probably get rid of that concept eventually. It's just too difficult to try to balance lots of tiny little plates on one large plate and yes, many of the food items like pasta and potatoes became dry and lost their flavor and textural interest. I stuck with the kalbi, red wine mushrooms and crab cocktail. They have a lot of variety and I appreciated a lot of the interesting food options they attempted, even though they didn't always hit the mark perfectly at least they took the chance and I admire that.\n\nThe desserts are yummy. I can never get enough chocolate covered strawberries, French macaroons or gelato. Stay away from the chocolate covered crabapples.

As we walked up to the desk, they were having a lot of issues with the register and for some reason couldn't scan our credit card, obviously the girl was new, but we were all so hungry and a bit irritated.  Finally we were seated and we rushed to the food line.  \n\nI must say their presentation is like dining at a French restaurant, everything is portioned out and so well presented.  I first walked down their cheese and bread aisle, I took a little bit of everything and I was a bit disappointed.  I love bread and there's not a lot of bread i hate, but everything tasted hard and stale.  Not my cup of tea, so I went back and took a little bit of everything else.  I tried their mushroom in a red wine reduction, that I enjoyed, then I had some of their salmon, didn't like the taste of it, I got some Kalbi, the meat was super salty, the pho noodles were terrible, it tasted like chicken broth and noodles.  The lobster was also very tough and not tasty at all. The only hot food dish i enjoyed was their Shrimp, now that was really good.  It was a spicy salt and pepper seasoning and i went back for more of that, other than that I just went back once for everything else, and I normally do not do that.\n\nSo after i finished i thought the dessert never lets me down, so I walk over there and they had little milk and white chocolate dipped gala apples on a stick, bars of chocolate, different parfaits and cakes and also gelato.  The apples were terrible, they were very soft and mushy, tasted like they were bruised, the bars of chocolate was good, the parfaits combined too many random flavors together, the only thing I enjoyed and glad they didn't go wrong was the pistachio gelato.  \n\nOther than the shrimp and gelato, I definitely wouldn't go back again, unless the day I went the chef was just having a bad day.

That's the best way to describe the Wicked Spoon Buffet. My husband and I , giddy since we just dropped the kids off at school,had Valentines Day breakfast at the Wicked Spoon Buffet. The dining room was pretty cool, done up in browns and was very modern in a West Elm kinda way. My hubby did make a snide remark about the female Wait Staff uniform. It was a strange brown ginghamy, wrinkled, shirt-dress type deal that was not at all flattering. \nThe breakfast spread was cool, with small individual servings of items like 3 kinds of benedicts, smoothies, yogurt parfaits. The presentation was about the only great thing about this place. The benedicts, though made in small batches, had hard biscuits at the base, dry tough ham and sauces that quickly congealed making them very unappetizing. Hubby and I were unable to eat our respective benedicts. They had red velvet pancakes.... Babycakes don't even break a sweat... they were just dried up red colored pancakes with dried cream cheese drizzled on. The omelet station had some great fresh looking savory fillings but the avocado topping they placed on mine had a weird tangy taste that ruined it for me! \nWait staff was nice enough but slow, took their time clearing plates and refilling water They serve you water in these glass bottles. I'm sure they refill them but at least you have access to water while they take their time working the room! \n\nThe plu$$es: \nGreat breads especially their tangy sourdough! \nGood granola \nWalnut French Toast \nOmelet Station - just no avocado pleeze! \nIndividual cereal boxes... some good kinds not just Raisin Bran! \n\n$15 dollars for a weekday breakfast.. not so bad.

So, we decided to first check out everything before we started shoving food onto our plates.  We were literally running around oohing and aahing.  We were like 2 kids (grown adults) in a candy store.\n\nThe Asian food was surprisingly good!  The fried rice is usually overlooked, but it's really good.  So are their rolls and dim sum.\n\nThe ricotta spinach was also something that was really good.  It's creamy, but also light.\n\nThe consistency of their mashed potatoes were the best!  The Korean need salad was tasty and super refreshing.  They even had crab claws that were already cracked.  The shrimp cocktail had the shrimp completely peeled and defined.  (Prefect for lazy people like me!)\n\nI don't eat lamb, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it with the chimichurri sauce.  The mac n cheese bar was amazing!  My boyfriend also loved the goat cheese mac n cheese.\n\nThe dessert was impressive.  They even had desserts served in real painted eggshells.  Very creative.

You know how you go to a buffet and see what you like and then you scoop how much you want on your plate...by the time you get to your table you have a plate full of the whole buffet all smooched together.

They just come off the grill and its so tender and juicy.  \n\nThe only thing that was a disappointment was that they didn't have the crab legs...I was kind of looking forward to those.

I was crushed.\n\nThat said, the food there was just fine, it just wasn't what I had hoped.  The variety of foods was impressive but I have to say that the selection within each food genre seemed kinda slim.  My favorite dishes were the prime rib-y thing and the kielbasa.\n\nFor dessert, as others have mentioned, look good, but there were no signs to suggest what each item is.  I was mighty full by the time I hit the dessert bar so, while I was quite impressed with the presentations, I statyed away fro most of ht pretty looking unknown treats.  I got a plate of berries and lemon gelato which was just light enough for my dessert.\n\nI have to also mention that I got the bottomless mimosas with the meal.  I had two mimosas and then moved to bloody Marys.  The bloody Marys were much better than the mimosas.\n\nThe ambiance was much nicer than those of the Rio World Buffet or the M Resort's Studio B buffet, but I have to say that I preferred the food at both the Rio and the M over Cosmo's Wicked Spoon.\n\nOne final note.  We had a large group, 16 people.  The manager was kind enough to allow two of us to line up while the rest of our group gathered (most of us had a late night).  After the pair reached the front of the line they gave us 15 minutes to gather our group and then they let us all right in, reserving a pair of cashiers to let us all pay individually.  After seating us, the initial response from our waitress seemed kind of annoyed and b*tchy, but after we figured everything out (drink orders and what not) the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  I can't say I blame them for being initially annoyed at the confusion.\n\nIt was a good experience, and the food was good.  But I would be sure to check the food list before coming in, and honestly, I think I'm more inclined to check out some of the other buffets or returning to Studio B before coming back to Wicked Spoon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

But service got better after we got our drinks. I think more staff was starting to work. \n\nThe food was okay. There was a lot of variety from traditional breakfast of eggs, bacon, and pancakes to more ethnic varieties of tacos, sushi, dimsum, and pasta. But nothing stood out except the ham and the pastries. The ham was moist and cooked perfectly. The pastries were flaky and tasty. \n\nAlso disorganized. Staff couldn't tell if people were still eating or if they left. They cleared out our neighbor's table and gave it to another party only to find out the original party was still eating and now had no place to sit! The original party was polite about the situation and agreed to sit somewhere else.", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Dined here about 7:15p on a Thursday. $27 for dinner, so about $29 with tax. Very friendly service. Got seated right by the entrance so everyone coming in can see us, but whatever. We were waiting for a friend anyways so this made it easy for him to find us.\n\nNicely decorated and not too large of a dining area. So it's easy to get around. Start at the left with appetizers and salads, and work your way to the right, ending you with a vast array of fudge and other decadent sweets.\n\nIt is very nice that most of the items are individually portioned. But even with the small portions, I didn't actually finish any of the dishes because I wanted to make sure I could try everything. And the crab claws already opened and in little saucers with cocktail sauce, nice touch! The salads were fantastic. The breads, not that great. The kobe beef shoulder, yum! Also the truffle scalloped potato, delicious! There was a select few items I did not care for, but I don't even remember it. I read notes that someone mentioned the braised short ribs and they were as expected, tender and flavorful!\n\nI didn't try much from the pizza/pasta or asian section. I had to save room for desserts!\n\nI loved their selection for ice cream. I tried the coconut lime and the pb&j. Both were yummy with a little tiny cone I used as a scooper :)\n\nAlso note the amazing quantity of large chocolate covered strawberries, some plain, some white chocolate, some with nuts, some with oreos, etc. Also mini chocolate dipped apples! YUMMY!\n\nAnd then there were crepes, which I didn't get a chance to try. Cookies there were really good. Strongly alcoholic tiramisu cups. Other sweets that were too sweet. Overall, though great place with a nice selection. A close second to Wynn Buffet IMO, but for the price, I might come here more often.\n\nOur server, I can't remember her name, but she was very sweet and everyone worked together to make sure we had enough room on our table for new plates as we eat very quickly and create a ton a dishes. Good job.\n\nOne thing, The buffet is such a long walk from the rest of the restaurants. If you go up the escalator/elevator by the chandelier, you gotta walk through a long hallway passing by 2 large high heel shoes and another quiet hall to finally reach the buffet at the end. But note: if you are only coming for the buffet, park at the west elevator and take that escalator up that is right by there instead of walking all the way through the casino and back around upstairs. ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

First off, $27 for dinner is about $10 less than other hotels such as Bellagio and Wynn.  Yes this buffet may not have sashimi or lot of seafood such as crab leg, this hotel has variety, innovation, and something different.  They have the traditional salad and meat stations but they have other new offerings that other buffets don't have such as...bone marrow, pork belly bun, pork belly fried rice, dashi broth, truffle potato gratin, smelt fries, tiny ice cream cones, and much more.  The presentations of each dish were very well done.  Some dishes had their own little pot or own little plate however this did become an issue when it was time to put food on your plate (spacing).  The desserts were a bit weak even though the colors made it very tempting.  For example, macaron's quality/texture was what made it bad.  The shell was too crunchy where if you put some force on it, it would just crumble.  \n\nThe service and decor were both great.  The restaurant is not like other buffets, it is away from the dining area and casino in the conference area.

It is a unique buffet but it looks better than it tastes. \n\nThey had a nice omelette making station here it allows you to customize your own, and even offer the option of egg whites and smoked salmon which most other places don't have.

Great variety as you get all kinds of cuisine, American, Italian, Asian, Mexican etc etc. I really have to rave about their dessert, make sure you save room for these because they are what makes this buffet a step above the other Vegas buffets in my opinion. First of all, it's huge, even bigger than Wynn's dessert bar. Second, everything is SO CUTE! Hence making everything look even more appetizing. The dessert come in small portions and the plus side of that is you get to try a variety of their delicious desserts instead of getting full from one big slice of chocolate fudge pie. Nothing is too sweet so you get to enjoy other flavors and textures of their dessert such as the sourness in the mango gelato, fluffiness of coconut puree, and the richness of the chocolate of the chocolate-covered gigantic strawberry.

Need I say more? We did the brunch. 30 bucks but wait..add 9 dollars and you get unlimited mimosas and bloody marys..hello??We were ALL in.  The spread of the food was very grand and very beautiful. Just the dessert bar was breath taking. Pork belly fried rice, pad thai, beef and broccoli (the broccollini not the regular broccoli)house special sushi rolls, and duck were just a FEW of the Asian cuisine. I go down a food bar and there's miniature pots with lids and inside them are things like eggs benedict with pork shoulder, pastas that I don't get to normally eat so I can't pronounce them let alone spell them but they had things like lamb and short ribs cooked with them...AHHHH!!! The macaroni and cheese..why was is so special? It was cooked with hamhocks...You want smoked salmon with cream cheese on a bagel? Well buddy, they had pastrami smoked salmon..get that...Red velvet pancakes, mini white and dark chocolate covered apples, ginormous chocolate covered strawberries, italian gelato that was to die for...... I could go on and on and on...just go try it for yourself..you won't be disappointed. You will be a little happy camper like I was..literally...we camped it there for 3 hours trying to savor EVERYTHING..gluttony at it's finest!

There were gelato flavors a plenty, and all yummy too.\n\nThe mac-n-cheese is overhyped.  Those pots were always the first to go!  I was watching the station like a hawk for fresh pots.  Too bad when I finally snagged one, I was left with disappointment.  It was lukewarm (like a lot of the other food served).  Cooled mac-n-cheese = one thick mess.  Maybe it never stood a chance to my highly set expectations.  Thanks a lot, Yelp.  Nevertheless, one forkful was plenty.\n\nThe prime rib was so bloody.  I like my cuts medium well, maybe medium.  That slice was borderline raw.  Not my fancy & I'm not alone.  Two others at my table had the same problemo.\n\nTacos al pastor were WAY too salty.  Even a fully squeezed slice of lime couldn't help it.\n\nPretty extensive selection of brunch foods.  You can jump from red velvet pancakes to clams to pad thai to pizza and back to the omelette station.  There was no wait whatsoever to get a table.  Definitely a plus; however, service at the tables was so slow.  At one point, I had to clear my own area of old plates because I had no more room for new plates.

His station was only one table away from ours, so I was tempted to just get it myself.  \n\nThere was a nice variety of food available, but I couldn't help but think buffets are really for people that just care about quantity.  There wasn't one dish that stood out as being very good.  I especially love breakfast pastries and that should be one thing that would be easy to do well on a buffet.  However, the croissants looked so awful I didn't even take one.  The pain aux raisins and muffins were mediocre while the desserts were downright awful.  \n\nI did enjoy some french toast and their house-smoked sausage was good.

My stay at the Cosmopolitan included a $50 breakfast credit to be used at my choice of The Henry, Coffee Beanery place, or Wicket Spoon.  I woke up hung over so I wandered down to the buffet.\n\nNow, I don't have a whole lot of buffet experience to compare it to.  I've only been to the Plaza's buffet for breakfast years and years ago before I moved here and knew better, Makino Sushi/Seafood at the Premium Outlets, and the MGM Grand Buffet for lunch (it was comp otherwise to this day I most likely would still have never been to it).  I left Wicket Spoon stuffed, because I felt the need to try a bit of everything.  \n\nThe following is what I remember having:\n- Seared whitefish eggs benedict\n  *** This was AMAZING - MUST TRY!!!\n- Margharita flatbread\n- Red velvet pancake\n  *** Very disappointing.\n- Pecan sticky bun\n  ***  I don't usually eat crap like this, but this was bomb.\n- Home fries\n- Hash browns\n  *** Topped w/cheddar cheese and carmelized onions, which is a plus, but the taters themselves could've been crispier. \n- Some type of crepe\n- Some type of french toast on sterioids: it was super super thick, had cinnamon, pecans and a think syrup which reminded me almost of caramel sauce.\n  *** Pretty yummy, and unhealthy!\n\nSide note: they do not have peanut butter!  This is a big no-no for breakfast lovers such as myself, as I eat it every morning!\n\nI believe I tried a few other things but can't remember exactly what.  But...seared whitefish eggs benny...oh, how I adore you.  \n\nI don't eat land-roving meat (only fish/seafood) so I didn't try any of the sausage, bacon or meat related items.  Some of the other things I noticed but did not try were made to order omlettes, smoked salmon, various cereals & yogurts, waffles, one or two more selections of flatbreads, fresh fruit, etc.  So, overall there was a good selection to choose from, however I was expecting it to be a bit bigger in size (but maybe that's my buffet inexperience showing).  \n\nA lot of items, as you will read from other Yelp reviews, are portioned out into individual serving dishes.  This is a neat, unique concept.  The only downfall I found was it made it a tad difficult to gather multiple items in one trip.  Maybe that's what they're going for, so people ultimately eat less...I don't know.  What I do know is I must've looked like a pig with all the individual dishes on my table!!!\n\nService was great.  Upon entering and exiting the buffet, the hostesses were very warm, welcoming, and greeted with a smile.  The server was attentive and also very friendly.  Like I said, I'm not big on buffets but if I were to go back to one for lunch or dinner, it would most likely be Wicket Spoon.  If you're a buffet person, you should definitely put this one on your list.  Happy eating!", "type": "review", "business_id": "zt1TpTuJ6y9n551sw9TaEg"}

Am I glad I did! \n\nThe food was fresh, fun, and really delicious. I really enjoyed the arugula salad (yes, I got salad in a buffet), the crab claws, and the bread. \nWorking my way through the buffet, the highlights were the pork belly sliders, braised short ribs, prime rib, and the Mac and cheese bar. \n\nYes, I said Mac and cheese bar. You pick what you want, and they whip up a b\u00e9chamel infused bowl of goodness that will make you rethink buffets for the rest of your life. Jacob whipped me up a  bowl of Lobster Mac and cheese that was so heavenly. \n\nI am not a huge dessert person, but I really loved them. The macarons were tasty and the salted peanut gelato was awesome. I also had an oatmeal cookie, which truth be told, I wish I had three of right now. \n\nThe service was a bit slow, I thought. \n\nOverall, though, just like the rest of The Cosmopolitan, it sets the bar higher for the next hotel to beat.

Many dishes came in baby pots, chinese to-go boxes, etc. It's a way to win an \"awwww\" with girls.. but with me? I don't really care. It's cute, but my money goes to taste not necessarily presentation. I tried a little bit of everything, but the salad bar (waste of stomach space). Nothing was really memorable except for the miso glazed pork sliders. Those were DELICIOUS. They didn't have enough meat selections, I expected more than just 3 (prime rib and some other two). The creamed corn was okay. \n\nTheir dessert selection was probably the highlight of the buffet. Yes, they were presented in a very \"cute\" way, but I didn't care for most of it. Chocolate covered long-stem strawberries, french macarons (they only had two flavors and they didn't look/taste very appealing). I do, however, like that they had a variety of gelato flavors. \n\nI think at the time when I was there, I thought it was amazing because I was in awe of how the Cosmopolitan looked and their presentation, but thinking now.. I probably wouldn't go back. Their food selection wasn't all that great. I think they try to mask their lack of food selection with all that jazzed up stuff (cute trays, baby pots, tiny wrapped food, etc). \n\nCrazy price for a just an \"okay\" buffet.

Our hostess did not fail to mention that we were being seated right next to the dessert section. Thank you hostess, for knowing exactly what I wanted without me saying a word! Now, onto the main courses (of which I had many of):\n\n-Mac & Cheese: Comfort food is so necessary after a night of vegas debauchery, so this sure hit the spot.  They are served in small individual tin pots which helps with portion control. In my case, there is no such thing as self or portion control so I had myself some seconds and thirds. No regrets, they were THAT good. Cheesy, oozing goodness.\n\n-White Whipped Ricotta Pizza: Easily became my second favorite dish as it paired so well with their garlic bread. Thin crusted, the ricotta simply made this dish the \"10\" rating it deserved.\n\n-Breakfast: Red velvet pancakes w/ homemade cream cheese sauce & bacon. Yes, I ate breakfast at 1:30 P.M. and enjoyed every bite of it. \n\n-Asian section: Pork belly fried rice, pork buns, Miso glazed pork (see pictures). Divine. Lots of pork so if you're not a lover, steer yourself in another direction.\n\n-Dessert: Biscotti ice cream, white chocolate covered mini-apples and strawberries. Scrumptious. One of the only buffets in vegas that showcases lots of white chocolate, which I prefer over chocolate, any day. The white choco strawberries had an Oreo crumb crust, definitely a winner. Had seconds of the Biscotti ice cream which came with mini-waffle bowls & cones. So aesthetically pleasing! They also have lots of other ice cream flavors to choose from - all fresh and homemade I believe.\n\n$26 brunch, $29 dinner on a Saturday.\n\n\nWicked Spoon displays lots of entrees that you will not find anywhere else.

Most of the foods are individually portioned into little pots, bowls, or chinese take-out boxes! I came here for brunch ($26) and was able to try a lot of different things, but could only fit at most about 5-6 containers at once on my plate. Some things that were memorable included the red-wine mushrooms, pork belly sandwich, and creamed corn. I thought their prime rib was pretty tasty as well. I wasn't too crazy about their pad thai. It was spicy, but lacked flavor in my opinion.\n\nThey have an extensive dessert section with all sorts of cute little bite-sized pastries and a gelato stand. Absolutely LOVED their assortment of chocolate-covered strawberries - white chocolate, milk chocolate, with oreos, with rice krispies, with peanuts...such variety! My friends must've gotten full off just that! And the strawberries were large ones...not those dinky ones you get from the supermarket :)\n\nI agree with one of the reviews below who said that this buffet is definitely a way to win an \"aww\" with the girls. My friends and I must've said \"awww\" more times than I can count during the meal. But this buffet doesn't hit high marks for practicality. You can't fit that many food items on one plate and for people who know what they like and want more of it, they are forced to get multiple pots just to get the portion they want. However, I give it 4 stars for decent food, extensive variety, beautiful desserts, and unique presentation.

The minute we walked in we were greeted by the pizza maker, Nico.  He was very personable and explained what would make a good slice.  We start off with a basic cheese slice, a pepperoni slice or a white slice and make \"magic\" at the end.  We told him to surprise us so he made us a white pizza w/ roasted tomatoes and basil + garlic.  Second slice was meatball w/ green peppers.  This is the BEST pizza I have ever had.  I used to love Rocco's pizza in Summerlin, but now that I've tasted this, it is ultimately the best pizza.  The price is very reasonable.  It's $3.00 and $0.50 per topping.

There wasn't too much sauce on it, which I fully appreciate. And the sausage was good, and had a bit of kick to it. They have a couple beers on hand. I can't remember the other one, but the one of the selections was PBR. I was disappointed by both choices, and opted out of getting the beer. \n\nOverall, awesome place to go to if you're in the area.

And this unassuming and \"hidden\" pizzeria, which is not even what their name is (according to the man I spoke to behind the counter) is located in the newest luxury casino to opened in Las Vegas.  It is on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, across from the escalator and located next to Blue Ribbon Sushi.  There are no signs indicating that there is anything down the short hallway adorned with album covers, besides of course the pinball machine and flat screen televisions mounted on the wall clearly visible to anyone who bothered to look in.  But instead of finding a hidden alcove of arcade games, you will find a counter where you can order your pizza by the slice or by the whole pie, and work space where they prepare the NY-style pizzas from scratch.\n\nPrices are reasonable.  Slices starts at $3 per slice (plain cheese), $3.50 (one-topping), $4 (two toppings combo), and for $6 (you get a slice of plain cheese pizza and domestic draft beer).\n\n18\" Pizza by the pie: $17 (Cheese), $18 (White Pizza - Ricotta & Mozzarella Cheese), $22 (three-toppings), or $25 (five-toppings).\n\nAvailable Toppings (in alphabetical): Black Olives, Extra Cheese, Fresh Garlic, Green Peppers, Meatballs, Mushrooms, Onions, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Roasted Tomatoes, Sliced Sausage, Spinach, White Anchovies.\n\nBeverages: Coca-Cola Brand fountain drinks, beer and wine (domestic and premium draft), Illy Coffee.  The cup of soda is pretty small, but you can ask for refills. :D\n\nDesserts: New York Cheesecake Slice and Cannoli.\n\nAlso if you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and too busy/lazy/important/lost :p to make your way to the \"Pizzeria\", you can ring up the hotel to have someone deliver your pizza order.\n\nBTW, the concept of selling pizzas by the slice has been around for a long time, just ask any UCB students, but to implement this concept inside a mega luxury casino is as Misti (LV Yelp CM) stated, \"genius\"!\n\n----2/15/2011----\nHoly cow!  I have no idea this place gets so packed at 11pm on a Tuesday night!  And their cheese-less pizzas with extra garlic oil added to the pizza sauce is dope!

The crust is so good, it's burnt enough to be really crispy, but not burnt enough to just taste.....burnt. The cheese was bubbly and piping hot.

Very new York style.  Loved the Pizza.  specialy the all cheese pizza, it was delicious.   If you love thin crust, you will appreciate this pizza.  My husband and I are a fan of this place and we are looking forward to having it again everytime we are in Vegas.  reasonable price.\nps. i cant believe the location!!! No marketing no signs.

Don't get me wrong, the pizza slices are large NY style and are pretty tasty, especially for the Vegas Strip but they aren't all that amazing either.  However, it was fun finding the place and walking through the hall of record covers and listening to the amusing pizza chef with the thick accent yelling \"pow! pow!\" as he waxed poetic about his white cheese with ricotta and cold slices of tomato pizza which he dubbed the \"waiting for the sunset\" pizza.  It's a great place to grab a cheap late night meal if you don't feel like leaving the hotel.  Free refills on soda is a big plus as well!", "type": "review", "business_id": "eq6lQI039SBLC6sHm3idGA"}

He then said something to the guy making the pizza, but 15 minutes later, still nothing.  I then decided to cut through the middleman and ask the guy making the pies myself.  I then saw him take a plain cheese that had been sitting out for about 10 minutes and throw some toppings on it and then into the oven.  After waiting for that long, I didn't care that my pizza wasn't even fresh, but the icing on the cake was that they didn't even get my order right.  There was a guy in front of me whose order was messed up too.  Honestly, if I hadn't already paid, I would've left or if I hadn't already left a 20+% tip, I would've left nothing (and I've never left nothing!).\n\nTry to avoid coming here on busy nights.

The kind you have dreams about. The kind that you tell your out of town friends to make trips for. The kind that you wait in 45+ minute lines for. Life. Changing. Pizza. I will happily drive out of my way, fight rush hour traffic and wait in a 30 person-deep line for this pizza because it is THAT good.\n\nI knocked two stars off because of the wait, which was due mostly to the fact that the staff had their buddies running back and getting special made orders and walking out past the line waving their fresh slices in front of a line full of hungry people whose blood sugar levels were ranging on a scale from straight delirium to I-will-stab-you-and-eat-your-pizza-before-I-call-an-ambulance. Several times, hoodlums of all sorts, waltzed past the line, through the back door, distracted the pizza makers from um, making pizza, by chit chatting and putting in special orders all the while the rest of us stood in line, trying to show some restraint and not walk out or commit homicide. It was completely rude and disrespectful to the patrons and this definitely tarnished my experience.\n\nHowever, if you're lucky enough to cross paths with Nico (from other reviews, I'm guessing this is the person who runs the joint) once you get to the front of the line, he turns on the charm and temporarily makes you forget that you're moments away from eating your own fingers. I got a slice of plain cheese and  white pizza out of necessity because those would be the fastest to put together and he suggested I put some tomato on the white pizza. Good choice-the tomato had such good flavor and tasted in season.\n\nOverall, this pizza will blow your mind grapes, but might be best to check this place out with a snack pack on you or go during the off hours (if there is such a time for this place, which I doubt there is).", "type": "review", "business_id": "eq6lQI039SBLC6sHm3idGA"}

I first stopped in due to pure rumor of deliciousness and was led there by its intoxicating aroma. \n\nWhen you first walk in you'll be greeted by a staff that makes the word gregarious seem modest but they have an obvious passion for pizza making and their quality ingredients.  What I was most impressed with is the made to order style and due to my dairy allergy they were able to make a \"Red\" pizza with all the toppings and still very satisfying.  \n\nA key thing to remember is you better hit up the ATM after an evening out since this is cash only and be prepared to wait if you're asking for something fresh and made to order.  I can see myself and many others considering this place the \"happy ending\" to many future nights at the Cosmopolitan.", "type": "review", "business_id": "eq6lQI039SBLC6sHm3idGA"}

The secret pizzeria in Cosmopolitan is no exception. In two days, I have overheard about this place from a complete stranger while waiting in line at another restaurant, read the stellar reviews on Yelp, and today, heard about it on a morning radio show. I knew I had to try this place ASAP.\n\nLucky for me, I work on the Strip so my co-workers and I went during lunch. Good thing I did my research or we would've never found the place. It was like a treasure hunt... third floor, next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, down a secret hallway lined with album covers... and there it was!\n\nOnce I saw the white pizza come out fresh from the oven, I knew I wanted a slice of it before even hearing what's on it. A slice of the white pizza and a soda cost $7. Not too shabby at all.\n\nThe pizza was heavenly. The crust had the right amount of crispiness, garlic and cheesiness. I'm usually not a crust eater but I devoured every last bite. I seriously considered buying a whole box but didn't want to share with the whole office.\n\nThe real test was when I brought back a slice of cheese pizza to my co-worker, who is a New Yorker, and is very critical about restaurants that claim to have \"authentic New York pizza.\" He said the pizza was \"pretty damn good.\" \n\nI'm pretty sure you'll find me here at least once a week for lunch.
