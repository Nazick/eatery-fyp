***hot_FEATURE***
P_A_Env_Type ::: my first time was a one-O_Exp_StarsByCus O_Experience: Restaurant was ridiculously P_A_Env_Type/hot and P_A_Env_Type/humid inside, the S_Staff lacked any sort of motivation for good customer Service, and they crammed the 7- or 8-piece band in the front of the A_Plc_Bar near the A_Furniture, making for awkward A_OutsideView and playing

***dirty_FEATURE***
P_A_Env_Type ::: its biggest downsides:- it's touted as a blue-collar A_Plc_Bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and P_A_Env_Type/dirty than Food; $O_Pay_Price for a 5-bottle bucket of F_Drinks is not a good deal, and $O_Pay_Price for a pbr & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard O_Pay_Price for such a combination- the ladies A_Places is ridiculously P_A_Env_Size/tiny and awkward, had a A_Fur_Table that was half hanging off the bowl, and no tp- every A_Environment was P_A_Env_Type/dirty or sticky, yuckyou probably won't die if you go to see a friend's A_Ent_Music play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside

P_F_FI_Healthy ::: but i really liked the F_Ingredients and the P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem that was wilting more and more as S_Del_Time went on
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: you can tell it isn't P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem and never F_FI_Taste super
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: quality F_FoodItem, super P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem, and S_Stf_Behavior kochujang(?) F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: , once again skimped on F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Quality/old and yellow (how can you not make P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem everyday?) , and they seem to think spicy means throwing in a shit load of crushed red F_FoodItem which adds no F_FI_Taste or spice just stomache irritation,
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: the F_FoodItem is tender and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, the F_FoodItem inside is also F_FI_CookingLevel
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was hard and not P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: Food was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and a perfect Food!  highly P_O_Experience/recommend!

cherries has the potential to be a decent Food in market square, but they don't quite deliver
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: the F_FoodItem are definitely P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_Taste/delish
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: Food F_FI_Taste a little 'processed' or maybe just not very P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fresh
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: so i'm going to keep it simple: this Restaurant's Food is P_F_FI_Quality/clean, P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, made to S_Delivery
P_F_FI_Quality ::: Food was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot and P_F_FI_Quality/fresh, F_FI_Taste were great, delivery S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: the brunch S_Menu was sparse, most Food F_Drinks down (F_FI_Taste nothing like they should), Food didn't F_FI_Taste P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh & to make it worse - my glass of F_Drinks had stuff floating in it
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: it must have been a good catch they had come in because F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and melt in your mouth buttery
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: the Food wasn't bad, F_FoodItem was pretty P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and since we went 10 S_Del_Time before Food was over we got to get the chance of getting free F_FoodItem F_Drinks

P_F_FI_Healthy ::: Food is always P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and they have japanese comfort fare too like udon
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: i S_Delivery 6 F_FoodItem and i tell you it's amazing!!  the F_FoodItem are made P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh in front of your eyes and the tongue must of been braised for hours upon hours
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: let's just say that i didn't even touch the F_FoodItem:  my wife got it for me as she knows i love it, but just eyeing the F_FoodItem, i knew F_FoodItem was probably not even close to P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and didn't really feel like spending my vegas weekend puking, so i left it
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: the Food is extensive and covers nearly any palette, but because F_FoodItem done in such a mass quantity and left to sit out, is not particularly P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh or hot
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: most Food was heat-lamped too long and was too P_F_FI_Quality/dry to enjoy, but if my tip would be to sit at a A_Fur_Table with A_OutsideView of the Food S_Staff - you can watch them put out new Food and run over to get Food P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: that's it and they do F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and they do them right
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: first it was the F_FoodItem, instead of being P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, tender and juicy, F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm and P_F_FI_Quality/dried_out, as if F_FoodItem had been left under a heat lamp or P_F_FI_CookingLevel/reheated in a microwave
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: F_FoodItem kept P_F_FI_Quality/clean and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: compare this to somewhere like F_FoodItem in Restaurant which has P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh pieces of F_FoodItem that each kind of form their own twisted and unique shape
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: it's the F_FI_Taste of the P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_Ingredients and the hot F_Ingredients that makes this Food amazing
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: very Food falafal and the F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: F_FoodItem F_FoodItem- P_F_FI_Size/large pieces of F_FoodItem tossed with P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and red F_FoodItem marinated in P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh squeezed F_Ingredients

P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: almost went with their F_FoodItem or P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem, but ended up with the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (hoping for a lil bit of comfort with each bite)
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i don't know what it is about this P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem, because their really is nothing out of the ordinary about it, but damn they are so good
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: but the F_FoodItem weren't P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled much, which is sad because F_FoodItem were otherwise P_F_FI_Taste/delicious

P_F_FI_Taste ::: the 4 F_FoodItem P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem is superb! F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste like a P_F_FI_Taste/crispy F_FoodItem and when paired with the homemade F_FoodItem soup it is magical
P_F_FI_Taste ::: the F_FoodItem was F_FI_CookingLevel nicely and the F_FoodItem, though not as P_F_FI_Taste/crispy as i wanted had a good F_Appetizer as well

***rude_FEATURE***
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: the only thing worse than their mediocre Food turns out to be their completely P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude and P_S_Stf_Behavior/condescending S_Staff
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude, especially at the A_Plc_Bar
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: the S_Staff was actually a bit P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude i thought constantly rushing us and reaching across me constantly to take S_Cutlery and S_Cutlery from other side of the A_Fur_Table, and at 2 S_Del_Time intervals???will not return
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: too bad i won't be back for them, as getting one means dealing with the P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude S_Staff
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: i should also mention that the S_Staff was fairly P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude while i was S_Delivery, like i was an inconvenience to S_Staff in showing up and politely expecting S_Staff to do S_Staff job for a S_Del_Time and a half
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: S_Staff had not looked to save any large A_Fur_Table or opportunities to hold our group and were very P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude when we asked again to try and be A_Fur_Table
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: we placed an S_Delivery for pick up, and when we got Restaurant, the S_Staff behind the counter had S_Staff head phones in and was pretty P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude, like S_Staff didn't want to be bothered
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: interesting reading other reviews complaining about the P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude S_Staff too
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: we were all shocked at how P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude S_Staff was and decided to move our once-a-month movie night to a different location
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: very P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: 75 for a sald with F_FoodItem in a stripmall joint is way too much, the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude and the greek A_Ent_Music is sooooooo loud
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: snarky, P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude S_Staff reflect very poorly on the managerial S_Staff of any Ambience

***condescending_FEATURE***
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: the only thing worse than their mediocre Food turns out to be their completely P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude and P_S_Stf_Behavior/condescending S_Staff

***noisy_FEATURE***
P_A_Env_Type ::: however, A_Environment does get very P_A_Env_Type/noisy during the dinner hour
P_A_Env_Type ::: we found the Restaurant quite P_A_Env_Type/crowded and P_A_Env_Type/noisy -- that's what you get at a (deservedly) popular spot, i guess

***quick_FEATURE***
P_S_Stf_Experience ::: strangely though, our S_Staff was amazingly P_S_Stf_Experience/quick to take away our S_Cutlery and bring the O_Payment
P_S_Stf_Experience ::: the S_Staff was nice and P_S_Stf_Experience/quick, and explained the S_Menu just right
P_S_Stf_Experience ::: the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Experience/quick and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive, Food is good (edamame!) and overall good Restaurant

***boiled_FEATURE***
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the slow-as-molasses Service and often-dirty A_Fur_Table: no biggie, since the F_FoodItem i get Restaurant comes covered in F_FoodItem spread and is chewy and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/boiled to true F_FoodItem perfection
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/boiled and perfect
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste P_F_FI_CookingLevel/boiled the one good thing the fries were fab

***surprised_FEATURE***
P_O_Experience ::: he ate a F_FoodItem and was P_O_Experience/surprised how good it was, too
P_O_Experience ::: the A_Decor itself P_O_Experience/surprised me because it's a very oriental A_Decor setting
P_O_Experience ::: first things first, Food/F_Drinks was phenomenal (pretzels w/ multiple F_Ingredients S_Menu, F_FoodItem pot pie is out of control - ask for some tabasco to take it to the next level)one problem - i was not sure for half the S_OpenHours if it was a gay A_Plc_Bar?? - the S_Staff (all dudes with schmedium t-shirts and the same crew cut) -- this is las vegas, not the castro, get with it and hire a few knockouts to get behind that A_Plc_Bar and do you proud
my boyfriend P_O_Experience/surprised me with two nights at tsr for our anniversary
P_O_Experience ::: we got Restaurant memorial day morning, and while we weren't P_O_Experience/surprised that we got charged the weekend O_Pay_Price, it was a bit weird that it was next to empty
P_O_Experience ::: get a O_Pay_Method even if you aren't playing much and you might be P_O_Experience/surprised how much you Offers your O_Payment (just give it to your S_Staff and they will take care of it)
P_O_Experience ::: with the F_Ingredients of F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem with a hint of F_FoodItem creamy F_Ingredients, this was absolutely great! and, after getting to know the fact that they were a Restaurant, i was pleasantly P_O_Experience/surprised, since the overall O_Experience of Service, Food was way beyond expectation compared to any other Restaurant
P_O_Experience ::: we weren't P_O_Experience/surprised by the F_FI_Price (it is on the strip, after all) and expected the F_FoodItem to be top notch
P_O_Experience ::: and i'm P_O_Experience/surprised that they O_Payment for the F_Drinks which other Restaurant seem don't do
P_O_Experience ::: not to mention very little herbs given

as i've always wanted to go here, my fiancé P_O_Experience/surprised me by taking me the the witchery for my birthday this evening
P_O_Experience ::: com/post/2982603033/unphogettable-mesa

this will be my first visit to a korean F_FoodItem joint here in vegas and i was delightfully P_O_Experience/surprised
P_O_Experience ::: i'm P_O_Experience/surprised people don't like the F_FoodItem because my boyfriend is crazy about them and gets them every time
P_O_Experience ::: when it arrived, i was pleasantly P_O_Experience/surprised by how good it was
P_O_Experience ::: i usually go to bed at 6 am so i was P_O_Experience/surprised i was still up
P_O_Experience ::: the other queen was pleasantly P_O_Experience/surprised at the F_FI_Taste of his P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem plate
P_O_Experience ::: if something scares you, order it, and you'll be pleasently P_O_Experience/surprised everytime
P_O_Experience ::: i guess this is arizona, and i should not have been P_O_Experience/surprised that next to the sweet and sour F_Ingredients Restaurant was a tub of F_FoodItem
P_O_Experience ::: i'd be P_O_Experience/surprised to see them make it to 2014
P_O_Experience ::: however, when it finally came i was P_O_Experience/surprised at the portions of some of the Food
P_O_Experience ::: i was a bit P_O_Experience/surprised that the sourdough F_FoodItem was so P_F_FI_Size/thick but it was still good
P_O_Experience ::: we were P_O_Experience/surprised to have the place almost all to ourselves, but then again, it was a sunday night and it was rainy
P_O_Experience ::: overall grade = b+ (very good)the ev foodie
i ended up trying this five guys again due to a large family outing and i was pleasantly P_O_Experience/surprised by the F_FoodItem being good!!  all eight people agreed the Food was good!
we love this Restaurant, so it's difficult to be unbiased about my review
P_O_Experience ::: what a delicious surprise at the mesa A_Decor festival!  i have been dreaming of a Restaurant to get a F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem with interesting and mouth F_Drinks F_Ingredients for as long  as i can remember!  i was a little P_O_Experience/surprised when i was handed my F_FoodItem F_FoodItem in F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, but it was better than a F_FoodItem

***disappointment_FEATURE***
P_O_Experience ::: lucille's was basically an overly-A_Env_AC conditioned gigantic P_O_Experience/disappointment, with a hyperattentive young S_Staff who did his best, gosh darnit
P_O_Experience ::: overall though a great Restaurant and fabulous Food!

talk about P_O_Experience/disappointment
P_O_Experience ::: unfortunately the F_FoodItem are not made Restaurant--what a P_O_Experience/disappointment
P_O_Experience ::: they're all to die for! oh, the F_FoodItem are great too! i wasn't thrilled with the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem to be honest, but that was my only P_O_Experience/disappointment
P_O_Experience ::: his F_FoodItem was much P_F_FI_Quality/harder than it should have been for just a P_F_FI_CookingLevel/toasted F_FoodItem which was a P_O_Experience/disappointment
P_O_Experience ::: without the F_Ingredients it would have been a big P_O_Experience/disappointment
P_O_Experience ::: overall, a P_O_Experience/disappointment
P_O_Experience ::: however - i've learned to live with P_O_Experience/disappointment in life and my visit Restaurant was just another added to that list
P_O_Experience ::: compared to a vietnamese gem like cyclo, the Food Restaurant is a bit of a P_O_Experience/disappointment
P_O_Experience ::: their F_FoodItem was *serious* P_O_Experience/disappointment, as was their F_FoodItem
P_O_Experience ::: to my P_O_Experience/disappointment it was not the bubbly P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot F_FoodItem i P_O_Experience/enjoyed at previous visits

***fried_FEATURE***
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: with an F_Appetizer of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried green F_FoodItem (for the kitsch factor, of course
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i will admit that we both P_O_Experience/enjoyed the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried green F_FoodItem, but it just isn't enough to save this place from its well-earned one O_Exp_StarsByCus review
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: this place is a fast good P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem option, much better than the other corporate spots
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: if i need P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, i definitely consider this place; however, it's not the best and it's not the worst
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem?  the best we've ever had in pittsburgh
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: although the Food F_FI_Taste fine, the Food is very limited in S_Menu: F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and a couple of other S_Menu
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: in addition, if it could not get worse, when you looked in the container of this supposed "sesame F_FoodItem", it seems they spooned in all the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/burnt residual F_Ingredients F_FoodItem that sits within the oil used for frying--meaning they are not periodically cleaning and changing the oil between orders--gross!on the plus side, the "house P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem" was descent, portion F_FI_Size was good, and the Ambience looked clean
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: and the sweet and sour F_FoodItem came with the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem in a container by itself, with the F_Ingredients on the side
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: please cut the fat, literally!
had the country P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the F_FoodItem was pretty much just a P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem F_FoodItem had been P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried twice over in F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: it was disconcerting that he couldn't be positive about the F_FoodItem grilled cheese or P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: we shared a P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_FoodItem which was outstanding
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: a full F_FoodItem P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried in F_Ingredients and perfect with the delicious yuling F_Ingredients and i had F_FoodItem good and P_F_FI_Taste/spicy
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i got the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_Appetizer which was a waste of money even if it was just $3 it was just P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem with no filling i was expecting actual F_Appetizer P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItems or for them to be stuffed with something
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i got the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_Appetizer which was a waste of money even if it was just $3 it was just P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem with no filling i was expecting actual F_Appetizer P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItems or for them to be stuffed with something

P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: wok P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried Food and F_FoodItem- lightly P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried and golden with a sweet and P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: wok P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried Food and F_FoodItem- lightly P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried and golden with a sweet and P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i chose S_Menu Food f-6 (P_F_FI_Taste/spicy thai holy F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem) -which was stir P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients, and thai holy F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the best soul Food hands down! i got the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem wi th F_FoodItem n F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem n F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i have to P_O_Experience/suggest the F_FoodItem!  it's like a F_FoodItem, but so much better!  the F_FoodItem isn't P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, but it is crisp, light and not greasy
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: likewise, the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Size/thickly F_FoodItem and looked like F_FoodItem had been deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried some weeks ago and merely heated up
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: my husband ordered P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and gravy and F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: 99--cajun P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem or smoked F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: of course, they were sold out of the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem but they had 1 smoked F_FoodItem left
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: skip the soft shell F_FoodItem, which is too P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried for my liking
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: it's a deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem knuckle Service with soy F_Ingredients for dipping
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: it was as good as the hole in the A_Decor A_LocatedArea in la , but damn $28 though? my lola is probably turning over in S_Staff grave if S_Staff knew how much we O_Payment for that damn savory, juicy, deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem knuckle goodness
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: so, what i would P_O_Experience/suggest is S_Delivery a few things with your group and share! my favorite Food is the F_FoodItem F_FI_CookingLevel and my hubby loves the sage P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem!
i ate at harley's for the first, of what will be many, S_Del_Time last night
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: we got the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried special F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and spring F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem was all P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: third visit: ayce F_FoodItem again!* P_F_FI_CookingLevel/steamed black mussel* ahi poki* P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem* spicy korean ramen* skewers: bacon & F_FoodItem, mushroomservice was a bit slower this time, but they apologized and threw in a bottle of free F_Drinks
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: F_FoodItem Food include P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem bowls
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: bottom line:  Food was consistent with every other F_Dessert factory out Restaurant (yay for avocado eggrolls and the best P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem in the world) but the Service was shoddy (really though, why would you bring out F_Dessert for S_Staff else and then make the 2 restless 4-year old girls S_Del_Time 10 more S_Del_Time for theirs? who does that?!?) i'll stick to the A_LocatedArea in henderson, or even brave the strip and head to the F_Dessert factory in caesar's
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: - F_FoodItem was deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, instead of pan P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, and, along with the breading/seasoning, the Food F_FI_Taste like a cheap spicy F_FoodItem nugget covered with F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: - F_FoodItem was deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, instead of pan P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, and, along with the breading/seasoning, the Food F_FI_Taste like a cheap spicy F_FoodItem nugget covered with F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i had P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried green F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, , greens & the house F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: (i didn't even realize that sprouts could F_FI_Taste unhealthy until i had these!) my husband had the F_FoodItem chop (F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried) and he was generally happy with his selection
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the S_Staff could not be any more P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly either! when it comes to the Food, you can't go wrong! the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem is to die for, and i can't wait to come for Food to try the F_FoodItem granola pancakes
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: floutas - more like giant taquitos, the corn tostada-wrapped F_FoodItem is deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried to crunchy perfection
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the F_FoodItem was nasty and F_FI_Taste like F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried in F_FI_Quality F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: how can you not love??F_FI_Religious & F_FoodItem F_FoodItem: the F_FI_Religious one was great and didnt feel like you were eating F_FoodItem wrapped in P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: amazing foooood!!!!that calamari is to die for, it has slices of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and freshly made tartar F_Ingredients that has a kick of F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: at least they S_Staff P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the stacked F_FoodItem are my favorite, complete with the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem on top to make everything F_FI_Quality
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: my favorites were: king crab legs with clarified F_Ingredients, prime F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_Healthy/freshly F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: machaca F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem has shredded F_FoodItem with two P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem in it
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i also like deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: my deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: , the Food was done S_Del_Time- giving me enough S_Del_Time to make myself a root F_Drinks float and watch az lose in ot- :( for 3 of us i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem, the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, mac and F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and 2 F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i may be seen in Restaurant again because i have a fondness for P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and i have tried their pulled F_FoodItem F_FoodItem before and liked it
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: F_FoodItem fingers- P_F_FI_Size/large pieces of juicy white F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_FoodItem & P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried to ultra crispy perfection
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the S_Menu has its share of deeply P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem fare and your side S_Menu include the also P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, F_Appetizer and F_Appetizer
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the S_Menu has its share of deeply P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem fare and your side S_Menu include the also P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, F_Appetizer and F_Appetizer
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: however, once you make your way past the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried with P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried Food, Restaurant is a great broiled section, that offers a S_Menu of F_FoodItem and Food broiled to perfection with some nice seasoning
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: however, once you make your way past the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried with P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried Food, Restaurant is a great broiled section, that offers a S_Menu of F_FoodItem and Food broiled to perfection with some nice seasoning
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: also had the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_Appetizer O_Pay_Price i can't remember

***enthusiastic_FEATURE***
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: the whole O_Experience was awkward, our conversation was continually interrupted by the P_S_Stf_Behavior/enthusiastic little S_Staff, and it was just so damn cold in Restaurant that we felt like we were being refrigerated
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: their S_Staff is very P_S_Stf_Behavior/enthusiastic as they greet you with a huge hello, how are ya as soon as you enter the business
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: i really wanted to like this place, i love F_FoodItem and the S_Staff working (the S_Staff?) was great - P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly, P_S_Stf_Behavior/enthusiastic and seemed to really want to bring the new england O_Experience to vegas

***cheap_FEATURE***
seriously?P_F_FI_Price ::: seriously?P_F_FI_Price/cheap 'vietnamese' Food with a plateau O_Pay_Price tag
P_F_FI_Price ::: not exactly a P_F_FI_Price/cheap Food for pittsburgh
P_O_Pay_Price ::: the S_Staff apologizes again and asks me if i want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! not only is it rare but it's a P_O_Pay_Price/cheap cut of strip F_FoodItem that is loaded with connective gristle
P_O_Pay_Price ::: good P_O_Pay_Price/cheap F_FoodItem, but like a previous comment, it gets harder and harder to keep going back
P_F_FI_Price ::: it just feels so unnatural!), P_F_FI_Price/cheap Food and F_Drinks, lots of A_Ent_Tv's A_Environment, and lots of A_Fur_Table and/or A_Fur_Table at the A_Plc_Bar
P_F_FI_Price ::: next time i'll skip the fries and stick to the single F_FoodItem, which for a "fast Food" F_FoodItem was pretty P_F_FI_Taste/tasty!
another P_F_FI_Taste/tasty P_F_FI_Price/cheap Food
P_F_FI_Price ::: many a time have coworkers and i stopped in for a great Food on the P_F_FI_Price/cheap
P_F_FI_Price ::: i remember the early days of soggy crusts, P_F_FI_Price/cheap F_FoodItem, subpar F_Ingredients and F_FI_CookingLevel  this is certainly no longer the case
P_F_FI_Price ::: yes, F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Price/cheap (only $22) but it's not even W_Price that
P_O_Pay_Price ::: yeah, sure its P_O_Pay_Price/cheap and not the mgm but the only reasons that i can think of anyone wanting to stay Restaurant is if they're really tight on budget or just want to ogle young girls in ridiculous outfits while A_Entertainment
P_F_FI_Price ::: the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem are good and P_F_FI_Price/cheap; and their special F_Ingredients is pretty damn P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
P_F_FI_Price ::: Food is P_F_FI_Price/cheap F_FoodItem and pulled F_FoodItem are good, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem good

***disappointing_FEATURE***
P_O_Experience ::: my friend S_Delivery the F_FoodItem, and then remembered S_Staff needed to ask about any F_Ingredients in the F_Ingredients due to an F_FI_Healthy and they just brought us out the jar of F_Ingredients, complete with O_Pay_Price tag of O_Pay_Price  maybe lots of Restaurant do this, but it's pretty P_O_Experience/disappointing
P_O_Experience ::: very P_O_Experience/disappointing is an understatement! good china boasts on their website that they were the 2007 recipients of new york's top 100 chinese/asian fusion award, and all i can say is that may have been so in 2007
P_O_Experience ::: we've been to a few triple d joints and most have been P_O_Experience/disappointing, making me wonder how much they pay to grab guy's attention and the publicity

P_O_Experience ::: i thought the Food was P_O_Experience/disappointing

P_O_Experience ::: never had a P_O_Experience/disappointing S_Menu item
P_O_Experience ::: what's up with the small F_FI_Size?  definitely P_O_Experience/disappointing on that part alone
P_O_Experience ::: Food was P_O_Experience/disappointing to me, as expectations were high based on the reviews i had read, but those were obviously for dinner
P_O_Experience ::: after a very P_O_Experience/disappointing F_FoodItem course we avoided F_Dessert
P_O_Experience ::: Service was very P_O_Experience/disappointing and not up to the F_FI_Price
P_O_Experience ::: normally love baja, but this one has been very P_O_Experience/disappointing
P_O_Experience ::: all in all it was a P_O_Experience/disappointing experience due primarily to the dismissive behavior by our S_Staff
P_O_Experience ::: i completely adore this place and cannot P_O_Experience/recommend it more highly - go!!

F_FoodItem in the uk has been grievously P_O_Experience/disappointing, both in W_Price and representation
P_O_Experience ::: i'm a total F_FoodItemaholic, so that was P_O_Experience/disappointing
P_O_Experience ::: the F_FoodItem tasted as if they used a F_Ingredients and tossed in some unripe F_Ingredients which was very P_O_Experience/disappointing because i usually love F_FoodItem out
P_O_Experience ::: needless to say, i had a great S_Del_Time Restaurant and can't wait to come back to play a couple rounds of skee ball at the A_Plc_DiningRoom!
very P_O_Experience/disappointing O_Experience

***little_FEATURE***
P_A_Env_Size ::: it's not perhaps the best P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant and tearoom in edinburgh, but on a street loaded with utter dives such as rabbie burns Restaurant and garfunkel's, it's certainly some way ahead of it's neighbours
P_A_Env_Size ::: gem!!! what a fantastic P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant
P_A_Env_Size ::: still, it's a P_A_Env_Type/fun P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant with P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff and fabulous hot F_Drinks
P_A_Env_Size ::: Restaurant our P_A_Env_Size/little secret Restaurant that we enjoy because Restaurant P_A_Env_Type/quiet and we usually leave feeling quite euphoric
P_A_Env_Size ::: would i P_O_Experience/come_back to bacchanal? yes, to give it another shot, but will need to time my next visit so it doesn't coincide during the rush -_-

we had tickets to the mercury game and were trying to get away from the crowds when we stumbled upon this amazing P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant!we both had chubby F_FoodItem with ranch F_Ingredients and F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Size ::: try it you will love it!

pros: great F_FoodItem, especially for ayce!!  whoever posted that their F_FoodItem are mostly F_FoodItem, are completely wrong!  in comparison to other ayce F_FoodItem places, they have very P_F_FI_Size/little F_FoodItem
P_A_Env_Size ::: so very sad :(

whenever i am in this (lame) part of town, i try to go to this P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant
P_A_Env_Size ::: it's a great P_A_Env_Size/little niche Restaurant idea, but once you get past all the hoopla this is Restaurant is a huge rip off

***old_FEATURE***
P_F_FI_Quality ::: we had the best S_Del_Time at ocean prime, Restaurant was live A_Ent_Music and they were singing some of the P_F_FI_Quality/old F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: as expected, the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Healthy/old and a F_FI_Healthy risk with every swallow greatly increases
P_F_FI_Quality ::: spent F_FI_Price on an P_F_FI_Quality/old country Food ripoff!! terrible A_Decor, uncomfortable A_Fur_Table, poor F_FI_Quality Food! don't go!!!!!
a great selection of P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and seasonal Food
P_F_FI_Quality ::: i have had some regular P_F_FI_Quality/old F_FoodItem from Restaurant in the past, and they were definitely better than average
P_F_FI_Quality ::: S_Del_Time for my F_Drinks for 20 min once and in the end it turned out they forgot ! sold me a day P_F_FI_Quality/old F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Quality ::: over the last 10 years i've barely ever make my trip Restaurant anymore because i am steadily P_O_Experience/disappointed in the F_FI_Quality if Food! F_FoodItem is spoiled or scarce, spring F_FoodItem filling probably a week P_F_FI_Quality/old
P_F_FI_Quality ::: , once again skimped on F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Quality/old and yellow (how can you not make P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem everyday?) , and they seem to think spicy means throwing in a shit load of crushed red F_FoodItem which adds no F_FI_Taste or spice just stomache irritation,

***coming_back_FEATURE***

P_O_Experience ::: whether or not, i'm still P_O_Experience/coming_back

P_F_FI_Taste ::: the F_Ingredients that came with the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/spicy and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and the accompanying F_FoodItem (carrot, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and bok choy) were really fresh, but the F_FoodItem itself was really bad F_FI_Quality
P_F_FI_Taste ::: we loved the drunken F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, and especially loved the sweet 18 F_FoodItem! F_FoodItem's a bit P_F_FI_Price/pricey at $16, but the sweet 18 was W_Price every W_Price! the P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem ball small plate was excellent as well

P_F_FI_Taste ::: * P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem - generous F_FoodItem, but perhaps a bit too much
P_F_FI_Taste ::: the other queen was pleasantly P_O_Experience/surprised at the F_FI_Taste of his P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem plate
P_F_FI_Taste ::: i tend to S_Delivery their diablo F_FoodItem, which comes with sour cream, F_FoodItem and jalapenos F_FoodItem so F_FoodItem is pretty P_F_FI_Taste/spicy but amazing
P_F_FI_Taste ::: Food came with F_FoodItem and was quite P_F_FI_Taste/spicy, which i like

***honest_FEATURE***
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: plenty of places to eat in vegas, but you should know that your S_Staff is not as P_S_Stf_Behavior/honest with your customers as you would like to think and your S_Staff on the street is reflecting of this
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: the S_Staff was great and when we were A_Fur_Table S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/honest and told us we could S_Delivery F_FoodItem and relax a little so the A_Plc_Kitchen could catch up!  we went for a relaxing evening and that definitely started it - he offered great input for various Food on the S_Menu based on what we said we like

***dry_FEATURE***
P_F_FI_Quality ::: texas F_FoodItem, at least from my own personal O_Experience (born in texas and raised Restaurant till i was twelve and moved to hawaii, which has a very different type of F_FoodItem), is generally P_F_FI_Quality/dry rubbed and smoked and any F_Ingredients is put on after you get your Food, at your discretion, and of course, thanks to the bountiful supply of cattle in the early years of the state Restaurant is a strong focus on F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and in addition, thanks to the many german settlers, it is also known for some great smoked sausage (in fact, if you find yourself in corpus christie take a drive out and go to F_FoodItem grove, a small town, at least when i was Restaurant 20 years ago that is very german and wow, the sausage, but that is another story)
P_F_FI_Quality ::: F_FoodItem F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Quality/dry, and without much F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_Quality ::: the F_FoodItem came P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked and P_F_FI_Quality/dry
P_F_FI_Quality ::: the F_FoodItem in the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Quality/dry and P_F_FI_Taste/tasteless

P_F_FI_Quality ::: the F_FoodItem were mostly P_F_FI_Quality/dry, they had F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients at the carving station and F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Quality/dry as can be
P_F_FI_Quality ::: the F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste okay, but my F_FoodItem was super P_F_FI_Quality/dry
P_F_FI_Quality ::: the selection was awful, all the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Quality/dry, the seaFood looked sketchy enough that i was too scared of potential Food poisoning to try anything, and a lot of items at the F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar were browning
P_F_FI_Quality ::: just the texture of the F_FoodItem turned me offlamb skewers:  F_FoodItem was a bit P_F_FI_Quality/dry but non the less P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! must eat with the F_FoodItem, the F_Ingredients and the F_FoodItem  all together!filet mignon sliders: yum yum yum!def will P_O_Experience/come_back when im back in vegas!

my wife and i both lived in thailand for many years and so we enjoy trying out thai places in the valley
P_F_FI_Quality ::: most Food was heat-lamped too long and was too P_F_FI_Quality/dry to enjoy, but if my tip would be to sit at a A_Fur_Table with A_OutsideView of the Food S_Staff - you can watch them put out new Food and run over to get Food P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh

***pricey_FEATURE***
P_F_FI_Price ::: don't get me wrong, it was tasty, if P_F_FI_Price/pricey, Food - pulled F_FoodItem with a bevy of F_Ingredients to choose from, F_FoodItem, mac & F_FoodItem, hushpuppies
P_F_FI_Price ::: Service was excellent, Food was P_F_FI_Price/pricey but W_Price it
P_F_FI_Price ::: the F_FoodItem was very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty but i thought F_FoodItem was a bit P_F_FI_Price/pricey

P_F_FI_Price ::: Food on the P_F_FI_Price/pricey side, but you probably know that already
P_F_FI_Price ::: calamari and F_FoodItem were decent but were a little P_F_FI_Price/pricey especially for Food
P_F_FI_Price ::: forget the P_F_FI_Price/pricey F_FoodItem at the big name Restaurant
P_F_FI_Price ::: we have been F_Drinks Restaurant for over 10 years and although the Food is P_F_FI_Price/pricey since everything is a la carte, it is well worth every penny
P_F_FI_Price ::: i did think F_FoodItem was a little P_F_FI_Price/pricey considering i could get a bigger better F_FoodItem at subway for about $3
P_F_FI_Price ::: Food is a bit P_F_FI_Price/pricey, but well W_Price it
P_F_FI_Price ::: i got upset because F_FoodItem pretty P_F_FI_Price/pricey
P_F_FI_Price ::: F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Price/pricey, but then again you're gonna eat a lot of different Food and lots of it, so that'll basically be your one Food for the day
P_O_Pay_Price ::: Service is sometimes slow, but i keep coming Restaurant so it's not that bad! Food a bit P_O_Pay_Price/pricey, but they offer some pretty good options

P_O_Experience ::: my wife and i went for an early dinner last saturday and i have to say i am P_O_Experience/impressed

P_O_Experience ::: we had the stuffed F_FoodItem as an app and weren't too P_O_Experience/impressed
P_O_Experience ::: never having had this Food until as an adult, i can tell you in beginning i was not P_O_Experience/impressed and only ate the korean bbq,  but about 28 years ago, i was working in korea and fell in love with the FoodRestaurant are three simply reasons to come here and if the three are speaking to you, move on to another Restaurant
P_O_Experience ::: i am no connoisseur, despite the overly descriptive detail that will follow, but have had my fair share of donuts over the years and was admittedly P_O_Experience/impressed to find that it is in fact possible to make a version that F_FI_Taste noticeably different than any other
P_O_Experience ::: the thing that P_O_Experience/impressed me the most was the range of F_FoodItem
P_O_Experience ::: Food came out fast and we were P_O_Experience/impressed with the F_FI_Quality of it
P_O_Experience ::: also the W_Price are very reasonable and just a great Restaurant for friends and A_Env_Type to get good local Food!

i was really P_O_Experience/impressed with the F_FI_Quality of Food at sage garden! they catered a meeting for us and  i thought their Food really stood out:they came in (on time) and set it all up for us in a timely/professional manner (as it was a working Food)F_FoodItem- excellent, i had F_FoodItem & swiss although they had F_FoodItem, ham, and i believe F_FoodItem to choose from
P_O_Experience ::: i went in for the first time since the remodel and was extremely P_O_Experience/impressed
P_O_Experience ::: not that P_O_Experience/impressed anyway
P_O_Experience ::: none compare to Restaurant! the F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Size/huge and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty! the F_FI_Quality of the F_FoodItem and the A_Environment are second to none! whenever i stay at the hard rock, i make it a point to dine here?by far the best Service!

we went to roy's on the advice of a friend and were P_O_Experience/impressed! the F_Appetizer F_Appetizer was "melt-in-your-mouth" amazing and the F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/yummy!   hard to believe that this is a Restaurant!  the Food was not "F_FI_Taste" and Service was outstanding!

my friend and i stopped here for Food
P_O_Experience ::: was not P_O_Experience/impressed with the selection at all, all their F_FoodItem Food said kobe F_FoodItem but who care if it F_FI_Taste bad and plus its F_FoodItem which isn't real F_FoodItem

P_O_Experience ::: i was absolutely P_O_Experience/impressed with the F_FI_Taste of this Food and will definitely go back the next time we're in town visiting our daughter!#kudosontheenthusiasm
i like centurion
P_O_Experience ::: i just can't say i was that P_O_Experience/impressed
P_O_Experience ::: i stopped in for a A_Decor Food and was favorably P_O_Experience/impressed by the place
P_O_Experience ::: S_Staff was leslie and S_Staff was very nice and upon wandering around the Restaurant was pretty P_O_Experience/impressed with the A_Env_Size and other nooks and crannies like the small upstairs A_Plc_Patio and sneaky small A_Plc_Patio
P_O_Experience ::: i have tried many things on the S_Menu and i have only been P_O_Experience/impressed by the F_FoodItem and the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
P_O_Experience ::: went Restaurant for a birthday celebration, and i have to say i was P_O_Experience/impressed! the party was on the A_Plc_Patio upstairs, and while the weather was unusually chilly and windy for a spring evening, the heat lamps and the rocking A_Places kept me warm

***inattentive_FEATURE***
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: another overdone steak and utterly P_S_Stf_Behavior/inattentive S_Staff! still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care

***kind_enough_FEATURE***
P_S_Stf_Behavior ::: S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/kind_enough to take my F_FoodItem back to the kitchen

***go_back_FEATURE***

P_O_Experience ::: would only P_O_Experience/go_back if i was invited by friends again

P_O_Experience ::: can't wait to P_O_Experience/go_back
P_O_Experience ::: we would never P_O_Experience/go_back
P_O_Experience ::: i would not P_O_Experience/go_back
P_O_Experience ::: i will have to P_O_Experience/go_back and see what other Food they have, but i think the Food would be good
P_O_Experience ::: would absolutely P_O_Experience/go_back again
P_O_Experience ::: so, since they didn't take care of my needs, i will never P_O_Experience/go_back Restaurant and i'm using yelp to vent my displeasure with this Restaurant

P_O_Experience ::: F_FoodItem? lebanese? american/? mexican? we don't know! will we P_O_Experience/go_back? probably not

P_O_Experience ::: their F_Appetizer was heavenly! we will P_O_Experience/go_back
P_O_Experience ::: i was thoroughly P_O_Experience/disappointed and will not P_O_Experience/go_back again
P_O_Experience ::: the other couple we were with had been here several times and obviously have had much different O_Experience than we had because i don't think i would P_O_Experience/go_back unless it was for a F_FoodItem because they had a pretty good looking list and the A_Plc_Bar area had A_Fur_Table and A_Places to mingle
P_O_Experience ::: so i've never had vietnamese pho before (pronounced fu, as in fun, without the n) and i decided to try it with a friend of mine who speaks vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to S_Delivery and what i was eating and also steer me to the best Restaurant in town so i'd have a positive initial pho experience and want to P_O_Experience/go_back again and again
P_O_Experience ::: the A_Plc_DiningRoom was pretty nice and seemed like a nice Restaurant to study or read, but i probably wouldn't choose to P_O_Experience/go_back
P_O_Experience ::: won't P_O_Experience/go_back
P_O_Experience ::: i doubt i will P_O_Experience/go_back
P_O_Experience ::: 'if the S_Staff banned cigarettes and e-cigarettes, that would somewhat make sense, but i still wouldn't P_O_Experience/go_back

P_O_Experience ::: we will P_O_Experience/go_back next time in A_LocatedArea
P_O_Experience ::: i will probably P_O_Experience/go_back, but begrudgingly
P_O_Experience ::: i personally cannot S_Del_Time to P_O_Experience/go_back and try other things on the S_Menu
P_O_Experience ::: i hadn't heard of Restaurant before - but now that i have, i'll P_O_Experience/go_back on my own
P_O_Experience ::: as a result, i was so excited to P_O_Experience/go_back last week
P_O_Experience ::: it's a little too pricey for me to be a "F_FI_Size" place to eat, but i will definitely P_O_Experience/go_back again
P_O_Experience ::: overall, good place and would P_O_Experience/recommend it and would P_O_Experience/go_back

P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: as are the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted root F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: my Food, the oven P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem tower was probably the least exciting thing i ate last night night, but still flavorful in its own right and beautifully plated
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: i'm just not a fan of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem which comprise about half of the stack
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: we came Restaurant on memorial day because we were too lazy to do our own grilling, and after smelling our neighbors cooking some F_FoodItem, we just had to have them!we got the fire P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem for the A_Fur_Table
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the highlight of the Food was an open faced F_FoodItem with P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem and goat F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: with your F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem that you purchase you also receive a P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the Food was particularly P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem flavor really carried through
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: their slow P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem is the best
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the szechuan F_FoodItem belly was a great starting F_Appetizer, the F_Drinks list was W_Price impressive than i was expecting, and the F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem was perfectly tender and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious - despite the understandable skepticism about smoked and then P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted

***flavorful_FEATURE***
P_F_FI_Taste ::: starting with the F_Appetizer, we had "spring F_FoodItem", and for those of you new yorkers, most Restaurant have P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful "F_FoodItem F_FoodItem" that are stuffed with a combination of F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem sprouts, and F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_Taste ::: Food turned out to be really P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, though!the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem is really F_Ingredients-y with just the right amount of F_Ingredients that didn't overpower all the flavor
P_F_FI_Taste ::: the F_Appetizer F_FI_Taste fresh and fluffy, while the F_FoodItem was definitely homemade and very P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
P_F_FI_Taste ::: the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and at the perfect level of chewiness, the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Size/large and tender, the buffalo F_Ingredients is spicy and not too greasy, and the F_FoodItem blankets all in wonderfulness
P_F_FI_Taste ::: however, if you have a delicate palate and very delicate tastebuds, you will know that this dishwater of F_FoodItem is absolutely more rich and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and refreshing!  the F_FoodItem itself is bland as well, it is boiled in water with minimal herbs, but it is so underwhelmingly just right
P_F_FI_Taste ::: not to mention that i had the best key lime pie yet! simply P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful, simply F_FI_Quality, and simply a great choice to satisfy my craving for F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Taste ::: 50) was tender and pretty P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
P_F_FI_Taste ::: the F_Ingredients that came with the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/spicy and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and the accompanying F_FoodItem (carrot, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and bok choy) were really fresh, but the F_FoodItem itself was really bad F_FI_Quality
P_F_FI_Taste ::: i had the F_FoodItem F_Ingredients verde F_FoodItem was very P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and the cornbread that came with it, i wished i had more of it
P_F_FI_Taste ::: seriously =)

always good- the F_FoodItem are generous and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
P_F_FI_Taste ::: a very P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful F_FoodItem (although Restaurant was nothing habanero hot about it)
P_F_FI_Taste ::: it was obvious that F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled and Restaurant was some type of F_FoodItem F_Ingredients on it F_FoodItem was extremely P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
P_F_FI_Taste ::: i ended up S_Delivery the F_FoodItem and with the Offers it was only $15! F_FoodItem were really good, very P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and F_FI_CookingLevel well
P_F_FI_Taste ::: the creamy yet tart flavor of the brie really lent itself nicely to the angus F_FoodItem and even though my son likes his F_FoodItem P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled well done, F_FoodItem was still juicy and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
P_F_FI_Taste ::: the F_FoodItem was tender, P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful, but not dry

P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: first it was the F_FoodItem, instead of being P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, tender and juicy, F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm and P_F_FI_Quality/dried_out, as if F_FoodItem had been left under a heat lamp or P_F_FI_CookingLevel/reheated in a microwave

P_F_FI_Healthy ::: (i went with my mother who is not a fan of P_F_FI_Healthy/salty Food and S_Staff said it was perfectly F_FI_CookingLevel too, so i promise it's not too salty
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: F_FoodItem came with a side F_FoodItem (fresh), F_Appetizer with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem (decent, not P_F_FI_Healthy/salty or F_FI_Taste), F_FoodItem (well

P_F_FI_Healthy ::: however, the F_FoodItem was way too P_F_FI_Healthy/salty
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: F_FoodItem was so P_F_FI_Healthy/salty that it ruined a good piece of good F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: a greyhound is like $8 (since i guess it fits their spirit+mixer format), but a P_F_FI_Healthy/salty F_FoodItem which is a greyhound with a F_Ingredients rim is somehow 2 or 4 dollars more? that's some expensive F_Ingredients
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: edit: my fiancée just informed me the P_F_FI_Healthy/salty F_FoodItem was 14 dollars(!)
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: my F_FoodItem was a little P_F_FI_Healthy/salty
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: wolfley's was definitely something you can't find anywhere in the country so what the hey! i would have S_Delivery their hometown favorite F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, but the S_Staff warned me F_FoodItem was quite P_F_FI_Healthy/salty
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: i'm glad she did since i don't take kindly on overly P_F_FI_Healthy/salty Food
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: i often find anything with F_FoodItem to be too P_F_FI_Healthy/salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet F_Ingredients pairing
P_F_FI_Healthy ::: carnitas - the F_FoodItem was served in cubes and was much too P_F_FI_Healthy/salty, unfortunately

***quickly_FEATURE***
P_S_Del_Time ::: luckily once we S_Delivery our F_Drinks, they S_Delivery fairly P_S_Del_Time/quickly and we were able to have one F_Drinks before our A_Fur_Table was ready
P_S_Del_Time ::: Food has always been S_Delivery out quite P_S_Del_Time/quickly, and with a big group if you give them the ok they'll bring Food out as it's ready vs
P_S_Del_Time ::: Restaurant wasn't much variety in the Food, and they didn't S_Delivery P_S_Del_Time/quickly enough (Restaurant was a point where was no fresh fruit to be found at all!)  also, even though someone said that F_FI_Quality beats out F_FI_Size, it sure sucks when you have to wait in line to get Food

***small_FEATURE***
P_F_FI_Size ::: it F_FI_Taste like the prepackaged F_FoodItem you find at the store and the F_FoodItem are so P_F_FI_Size/small

P_F_FI_Size ::: upscale, with a side of P_F_FI_Size/small back east F_FoodItem joint
P_A_Env_Size ::: yes, A_Environment's P_A_Env_Size/small, and yes, Restaurant almost always a wait for a table
P_F_FI_Size ::: as it was the F_FoodItem was so minimal and P_F_FI_Size/small it could not be F_FI_Taste even though i could see it
P_A_Env_Size ::: (before we went Restaurant the first S_Del_Time, i thought Restaurant was just a P_A_Env_Size/small fast-food Restaurant, but i was wrong - Restaurant is a P_A_Env_Size/big, full-service Restaurant
P_A_Env_Size ::: how can you go wrong?

Restaurant is a P_A_Env_Size/small, family-operated diner right on brownsville road across from the whitehall plaza
P_F_FI_Size ::: the P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem was great, very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
P_A_Env_Size ::: it is a pretty P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant, i think only 7 tables or so
P_A_Env_Size ::: Ambience is nothing special, but you are brought you drinks, unlike my usual pho Restaurant, Restaurant is a P_A_Env_Size/small nicety
P_A_Env_Size ::: they have good Food and i love their hot F_FoodItem!
"eat mo bettah!' i sure did!walk into this P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant, S_Delivery your Food from a super chill lay back S_Staff and minutes later you feel like you in new orleans
P_F_FI_Size ::: i S_Delivery a P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem to go and noticed they scooped the F_FoodItem out of a metal S_Cutlery F_FoodItem wasn't even being P_F_FI_CookingLevel/heated
P_F_FI_Size ::: - F_FI_Religious trio: so P_F_FI_Size/small and just okay
P_F_FI_Size ::: actually everything unique about this Food seemed to suffer sitting in the Food format, and the P_F_FI_Size/small Food for everything and your small S_Cutlery seemed to want to force you into multiple trips back to the Food until you just can't be bothered anymore and leave
P_A_Env_Size ::: it is tucked in a P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant off the strip in chinatown
P_A_Env_Size ::: located in the french quarter, l'express is a P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant that is lays packed and full of eclectic people
P_F_FI_Size ::: but F_FoodItem was a small plate of about 10 P_F_FI_Size/thin, P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Size ::: also comes with F_FoodItem and has a P_F_FI_Size/small good F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Size ::: they also have a punch card and punch it 2 times if you get a F_FI_Size F_FoodItem (only costs $1 more), or 1 time if you get a P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem
P_A_Env_Size ::: i would make a O_Reservation if going for Food as it was super packed and the A_Environment is relatively P_A_Env_Size/small
P_A_Env_Size ::: i think this Ambience was a house before they turned it into a Restaurant because the halls are a bit narrow and the A_Places are a bit P_A_Env_Size/small, but the Food is great! they give you F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem while you are S_Del_Time for your Food and their F_FoodItem is home made and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! Restaurant F_Drinks are amazing and huge (if you get the large) and pretty strong ;)
P_F_FI_Size ::: my only complaint is that the F_FoodItem was not very meaty and if i'm O_Payment $10 for an F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem shouldn't be P_F_FI_Size/small with F_Ingredients that hardly have Food to grab at
P_A_Env_Size ::: kind of P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant, definitely has that hole in the A_Decor feel
P_F_FI_Size ::: - a P_F_FI_Size/small slice of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was Service with the Food, instead of a customary F_Ingredients of F_FoodItem Service before/with dinner
P_F_FI_Size ::: it was very over F_FI_Price for F_Drinks A_Plc_Bar Food we spend almost $50 for the both if us for Food  the funny thing we were still hungry the F_FoodItem are really P_F_FI_Size/small
P_F_FI_Size ::: the P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem are a great F_FI_Size for two, the F_FoodItem (kind of like a thinner, round sicilian) is inventive and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, and the boneless F_FoodItem are reliably good (if unimaginative)
P_F_FI_Size ::: five of us were dining Restaurant, so we ordered two P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem, with each one being a half, so we had a nice S_Menu of F_FoodItem to try from
P_F_FI_Size ::: we were charged for a P_F_FI_Size/small Food of extra pita F_FoodItem to supplement the original small serving that arrived with the hummus
P_F_FI_Size ::: seaweed F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Size/small
P_F_FI_Size ::: very P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Size ::: little one took the F_FoodItem out and exclaimed how P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem was
P_F_FI_Size ::: the F_FoodItem was good,  our F_FoodItem F_FoodItem where P_F_FI_Size/small and P_F_FI_Size/thin compared the P_F_FI_Size/big P_F_FI_Size/thick cuts of F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem

P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the F_FoodItem, also P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasteless, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked and made from bad F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: why do most thai Restaurant skimp on F_FoodItem? i thought this was a Food that featured F_FoodItem?  instead, i found myself on the hunt looking for F_FoodItem underneath the rubbery P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: how do you lose the Food in your A_Plc_Kitchen?! i had apparently S_Delivery the last S_Delivery for P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem, but i was F_FI_Quality and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: F_FoodItem were maybe 5 to 6 very very small pieces of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem had been very P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked
P_F_FI_CookingLevel ::: ellis island is off the strip and can be difficult to get a taxi back from, the A_Fur_Table is your typical sticky wooden A_Fur_Table, and the F_FoodItem is usually P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked and by no means great F_FI_Quality

Food was mediocre at best, and P_F_FI_Price/overpriced
P_F_FI_Price ::: the Food was decent, but maybe a bit P_F_FI_Price/overpriced, mostly likely due to it's A_LocatedArea in the cosmo
P_F_FI_Price ::: the Food is way P_F_FI_Price/overpriced and the F_FI_Quality is marginal
P_F_FI_Price ::: F_FoodItem S_Cutlery was average and the F_FoodItem were good, just way P_F_FI_Price/overpriced for a walk up joint
