really good Food!! the F_Dessert was great! i loved it and when i am back in the old usa i can only hope i will cross paths with another culvers
you know what the thing is with culvers? you actually don't need that much, it's sort of like eating F_FoodItem F_Ingredients or F_Appetizer F_Ingredients
you can only have so much before you start getting that sickly feeling and start stirring that plastic Food around and staring down the F_Dessert and wondering why you dont wanna finish
yeah it's F_Dessert and it's heavy especially when you add every kind of peanut F_Ingredients F_Ingredients bar to the mix
let me tell you those first five spoonfuls are pure goodness then it goes downhill
less is more with this stuff let me tell you! next time i am getting the smallest F_FI_Size, and i will be far more pleased and not guilty i threw out a mega F_FI_Size Food
hahaha!
mr
roberts is not a Restaurant i'd ever go to for the sole purpose of going out
both times i've gone have been for A_Ent_Music, and both times were fairly different O_Experience
my first time was a one-O_Exp_StarsByCus O_Experience: Restaurant was ridiculously P_A_Env_Type/hot and P_A_Env_Type/humid inside, the S_Staff lacked any sort of motivation for good customer Service, and they crammed the 7- or 8-piece band in the front of the A_Plc_Bar near the A_Furniture, making for awkward A_OutsideView and playing
the A_Ent_Music was terrible and i spent more time outside than Restaurant
my second time was a better O_Experience, but still not one that would cause me to P_O_Experience/suggest other people go Restaurant
this time around it was a reasonable A_Env_Type in the A_Plc_Bar, but that may only be due to the fact that it was in the 50s A_OutsideView
the A_Ent_Music played in the back of the A_Plc_Bar in an alcove/side room deal and it made a lot more sense
the A_Ent_Music was still deafening and subject to random strangers twiddling the knobs on the mixer, but overall not too bad
free A_Ent_Music is the best thing (only thing?) mr
roberts has going for it
its biggest downsides:- it's touted as a blue-collar A_Plc_Bar, but it's more an excuse to be shabby and P_A_Env_Type/dirty than Food; $O_Pay_Price for a 5-bottle bucket of F_Drinks is not a good deal, and $O_Pay_Price for a pbr & a rail shot is a special for a couple hours one night a week when it should be the standard O_Pay_Price for such a combination- the ladies A_Places is ridiculously P_A_Env_Size/tiny and awkward, had a A_Fur_Table that was half hanging off the bowl, and no tp- every A_Environment was P_A_Env_Type/dirty or sticky, yuckyou probably won't die if you go to see a friend's A_Ent_Music play, but supporting a friend should be the only motivation for setting foot inside
i've been Restaurant a handful of times over the years for dinner
had no clue they had a weekend brunch S_Menu
i think i was the only one that  S_Delivery off the regular S_Menu in our group
based on comments no one went away unhappy with their S_Menu
our S_Staff had never worked opening shift before but did a great Service
the Restaurant is getting a little worn but it fits
i am sure i'll end up Restaurant again
no no no, this Restaurant panda express seem gourmet
garbage Food!
i have been Restaurant twice on a whim
the first time i ate my Food Restaurant and it was pretty decent
the second time, i placed an S_Delivery to go and unfortunately i should have checked it before i left
the Food was dripping in grease
not sure what Food was all about but i was so P_O_Experience/disappointed
did i eat any of it, yes because i was hungry however that was a mistake as i felt sick to my stomach later that day
i will give the Restaurant another try  one day as maybe the cook was having an off morning
like i said before, when i ate at the Restaurant,  the Food was decent, but take out, make sure you check it before you leave so that you don't end up with a box of F_Ingredients
blech
my O_Experience at this Restaurant was probably one of the worst i've ever had
my friends and i went Restaurant for a suns game and were A_Fur_Table at a A_Fur_Table near the A_Furniture
as we were sitting Restaurant, a girl who was S_Del_Time for a A_Fur_Table, looked above our A_Fur_Table and saw a cockroach crawling right over our A_Fur_Table
now granted, i have a phobia of bugs, and especially roaches, but this seems to me, like a pretty big deal
after the initial scare, i informed our S_Staff of this and S_Staff freaked out for a second, and ran off to tell someone
S_Staff didnt return for another 5 S_Del_Time, though it was only to bring F_Drinks
i then told the S_Staff near the A_Fur_Door and he exclaimed that it was horrible and he walked away(apparently to get someone?)
after another 10 S_Del_Time still nothing happened so i found the S_Staff again and told him nothing has been done yet
by this time, the others at my A_Fur_Table had gotten their Food
he told me that since it was so high on the ceiling Restaurant was no way for him to get to it
now, i'm no engineer, or trained exterminator, but i had about 2-3 different ideas on how to get to the roach
i didnt realize he was stumped
i felt like i should make a bigger deal about it, but instead i left
i don't feel like anyone should be forced to eat in those conditions, without at least an attempt to rectify it
i mean, i dont have any delusions about spic and span Restaurant
i know Restaurant are P_A_Env_Type/dirty, but to have a roach hanging over our A_Fur_Table is unacceptable
and the only reason the S_Staff would do nothing is because it would have made a scene
i guarantee you if S_Staff else in the Restaurant had seen it or was O_Experience it, something would have been done
for us to have to endure it because no else was being affected is basically saying we dont matter enough for them to do Food
how was the Food you ask? i didnt even see it since i was focusing on the large roach hanging over my A_Fur_Table
amazing Service from S_Staff for Food today, and seriously good Food!  a wonderful hot F_Ingredients with heat and a great F_FoodItem start things before you even get to sample the P_F_FI_Taste/tasty F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
highly P_O_Experience/recommended
my co-worker and i literally didn't know what we wanted for Food and were just about to put names of Restaurant in a S_Cutlery to draw
but when we wrote down tgif
well
Food fell into place for us! lol! so when we got Restaurant they had a banner A_OutsideView advertising a 2 for 10
99 on a half rack of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
i made my mind up before i walked in the door! they actually give you a separate sheet of paper for their 2 for 10
99 Offers so i guess you have to ask S_Staff for it or you'll never even know that S_Menu exists! i S_Delivery my F_Appetizer (F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients F_Ingredients(?) F_FoodItem) and my F_FoodItem
deeelicious!!! that jack daniels F_FoodItem F_Ingredients is something else! the Food comes with F_FoodItem and cole F_FoodItem
i asked if they could replace it with a F_FoodItem pilaf or something but that Offers won't allow it i guess :(
but the F_FoodItem was surprising okay! it has green F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem in it
kinda reminded me of the inside of a F_FoodItem minus the F_Ingredients! lol! we also S_Delivery a F_FoodItem a la mode
idk what it's called
but that was to die for!!! decadent and not super sweet perfect blend of flavors! great way to end the Food!
and
you get Offers F_Dessert at Food! :) i love a Offers!the S_Staff was awesome! super attentive
definitely will go back for more! :)
always wanted to stop by, just never did till today
the Restaurant is much P_A_Env_Size/larger on the inside then it looks
the A_Decor is impressive and not over the top
two full size pool A_Fur_Table and plenty of A_Plc_DiningRoom for S_Staff to relax while you play
two digital dart A_Entertainment as well
i was P_O_Experience/disappointed in the fact Restaurant don't have a A_Plc_Kitchen so no Food, but the S_Staff stated they may be getting it back soon, so i will definately P_O_Experience/be_back to check it out again
as other reviewers stated, Service is spotty (polite, but mostly absent, which is strange in a place this size)
Food is good: F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Size/large - clearly can be split by 2 regular size folks
well prepared and full of good F_FoodItem
our sides of the banana F_FoodItem and pumpkin F_FoodItem were clearly warmed over which was a little embarrassing for the S_Staff (who danced around the subject)  but the F_FoodItem course, which was the reason for visiting, hit the mark
not easy to get in and out of since you O_Payment at the register (O_Payment during our visit turned into a 10 S_Del_Time ordeal - it happens)
but, as yelp says, a-ok
my favorite Restaurant ever! i no longer live in madison but every time i visit, i make sure that i stop Restaurant
the Food is too-di- for, the Service is always friendly and-- espeicially after their remodel in the last year--the A_Environment is classy but casual
i really can't say enough goo things about this Restaurant
try Food, you won't regret it!
i have been going to this Restaurant for many years
it has changed A_LocatedArea and chaged S_Staff but its never lost Food along the way
i would say Restaurant got better as the years have gone on
by far the best F_FoodItem in town P_F_FI_CookingLevel/baked in house everyday
every party or  get-together i have or go to i will always stop Restaurant and grad some F_FoodItem
they have boars head F_FoodItem which is the best great Food sausage that comes in from chicago
they have great Food specials
they have take home F_FoodItem kits
they include the F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients, and F_Ingredients
S_Staff are good! check this Restaurant out if your in the A_LocatedArea
the F_FoodItem is worth going out of your way to get
P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic P_F_FI_Size/thin crust F_FoodItem with the best F_Ingredients cooked in a coal fired oven
Service was friendly and efficient
highly P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant
i kind of stuffed myself full of F_FoodItem slices- but hey i rarely get F_FoodItem so this was my Service and i won't be ashamed of myself f i break my scale tomorrow ah!
i went in Restaurant for Food
i had the F_FoodItem
S_Staff were a step above del F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, but they were still ok
not 9 bucks ok, but ok
my glass was never empty, and my S_Staff(es) were very nice
it was slow and it was A_Env_AC in Restaurant, i felt sorry for them
also, the A_Ent_Music drowned out the bible thumping street preacher screaming A_OutsideView
i wanted to invite him in for a F_Drinks and to tempt himself to think of the sins of the flesh
poor S_Staff looked like he could use it
wound up in all that rage
when Restaurant is F_Drinks and women 10 feet away
this place is a total F_FoodItem dive!  i dig; this is my A_Plc_Bar!  Restaurant generally pretty P_A_Env_Type/quiet and i can actually hear what you're saying
i enjoy getting small F_Appetizer Restaurant along with my F_Drinks
reverse every friday - sunday!  the Food is pretty good - i wouldn't say it's the best but edible
Service is great - S_Staff Restaurant is always P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and down to earth
the A_Decor is pretty cool - modern japanese style
this is my "no significant other" A_Plc_Bar - yes so if you're hanging with me and we're going to crazy F_FoodItem you best not bring your partner - you'll get slapped!  haha - really!  - enjoy!
the best mongolian F_FoodItem anywhere! yum!
amazing since the late nineties
still is in 2013
absolute worse
i would never stay Restaurant again
went on vacation with a friend Restaurant
the Service was piss poor, the S_Staff was all over the place and when we first got to our A_Plc_DiningRoom it still had filth in it
we received no basic amenities and received all around bad Service with this Restaurant
never again!
i am utterly addicted to their Food Food
the Food is P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic, and the S_Staff are very P_S_Stf_Behavior/polite and P_S_Stf_Experience/professional
i love this Restaurant to death
ok, if you have no other options
i work graveyard, and this is one of the only places that S_Delivery near me overnight
their F_FoodItem is ok, ny style
but, aside from their F_FoodItem, i'd advise to stay away
i don't think Restaurant's a single fresh F_Ingredients anywhere to be found
that includes their F_FoodItem/F_FoodItem
it's not too hard to throw a F_FoodItem breast on a flat grill, but this place insists on using pre-cooked F_FoodItem on it's Food
and you can really tell
all of their F_Appetizer are frozen, and fried
if this is your last ditch resort, then go ahead
but if you have other options, exercise them!
this review is just about the F_FoodItem, not the Service or A_Environment, as i have only S_Delivery delivery from this place
the F_FoodItem just isn't that good
they have some F_Ingredients combinations that are interesting, but i've found that most of them just miss the mark
they end up being F_Ingredients heavy or F_Ingredients heavy without much F_Ingredients or balance
their F_FoodItem are primarily watery iceberg F_Ingredients with a few F_FoodItem thrown in
their F_FoodItem dressings are bagged and uninspired
i agree that the mediterranean F_FoodItem is their best, but it probably the only thing i would eat if i S_Delivery from Restaurant again
ok, so is this place 1-O_Exp_StarsByCus or 5?¿?  stopped in Restaurant today just after 11 am for a first visit, to find out
the first thing i noticed was all the $100k+ cars in the S_Parking lot!  somehow that didn't seem to go with an old mexican Restaurant!  the next surprise was that the place was already getting busy!  they do have a loyal, moneyed clientele, for whatever reason!ok, so i stepped inside
it's an oddball Restaurant with a A_Plc_Bar A_Plc_DiningRoom as well as a regular dining A_Plc_DiningRoom and an A_OutsideView A_Plc_Patio area
the whole place struck me as pretty boozy, but credit that at least in part due to the fact that all of the other customers seemed to be having mixed F_Drinks (for Food?)
uck
so anyway, i ate in the regular A_Plc_DiningRoom, within which i wasn't completely comfortable
i'm picky about A_Fur_Table A_LocatedArea & A_Decor & i just didn't end up with a A_Fur_Table that i liked
the Food:  shortly after i was A_Fur_Table, a P_F_FI_Size/big bowl of F_FoodItem & a S_Cutlery of fairly hot chunky style F_FoodItem arrived
F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, & a second S_Cutlery of F_FoodItem was cheerfully provided
i S_Delivery a 2-Food combo, with a nana's [chile] F_Ingredients and a F_Ingredients (shredded F_FoodItem, hard shell) F_FoodItem
before long my S_Delivery landed on the A_Fur_Table, attractively placed on a piping hot platter
the relleno was unusual in that it wasn't F_FoodItem
it was a medium F_FI_Size, medium P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot F_FoodItem, stuffed with oaxaca F_FoodItem & topped with a little F_Ingredients or F_Ingredients
it was good
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Size/big, P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, & had a good amount of F_FoodItem
both the refried F_FoodItem & the spanish F_FoodItem were super good, & Restaurant was a bed of shredded F_Ingredients to mop up the platter with
for me, this was a 4-O_Exp_StarsByCus Food Service in 2-O_Exp_StarsByCus comfort
the O_Pay_Price was near the high end at $O_Pay_Price, but the Food portions were excellent and so was the Service
:-)
are we even talking about this?!?! this place blows my mind every time
those F_FoodItem F_FoodItem are a steal at twice the O_Pay_Price
for a truly incomparable O_Experience come Restaurant for dinner
walked in on a sunday night without O_Reservation and had an awesome A_Fur_Table!  ( we we're not A_OutsideView but sitting right at a huge open A_Furniture with a mostly unobstructed A_OutsideView of the bellagio fountains)the Service was awesome - the S_Staff was great, always had a smile and always realllly P_S_Stf_Availability/attentive, i loved that!the Food : it was a mere " meh!"  although, i would like to P_O_Experience/come_back and try something else
i had a new york F_FoodItem - didnt really like the crispy F_Ingredients they were Service with, the macaronni F_FoodItem was way too rich, and the F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste like a shoe!! i think theses people rely too much on their " F_Ingredients" and dont really give much thought to the actual  F_FoodItem
thankfully, i ate almost a whole F_Appetizer before the F_FoodItem came so i was P_O_Experience/satisfied!! lol
next time i visit this Restaurant it will be for  Food , and ill try a F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem
4 O_Exp_StarsByCus for the Service, the Ambience and the Service and the Service! definitely will be coming back
our last Food in vegas and we came Restaurant
we sat on the A_Plc_Patio (in january!) and had the best Food we've had in the 5 days we were Restaurant
perfectly cooked filet F_Ingredients with merlot F_Ingredients and good little french "F_FoodItem"
great gluten free S_Menu, a gluten free F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem S_Cutlery, and special allergy tags for Food
hubby and i had the F_FoodItem eye, F_FoodItem, and their version of mashed F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem was so P_F_FI_Taste/delicious as it was bursting with wonderful flavor
the shiitake F_FoodItem were amazing!  the mashed F_Ingredients was just ok
i initially S_Delivery a glass of white F_Drinks, but decided a few sips later that i needed a glass of pinot F_Drinks to pair with my F_FoodItem instead
our S_Staff gladly obliged with my request
i wish i can dock off half a O_Exp_StarsByCus because of the A_Decor they take of you at your A_Fur_Table
a lady with a camera came to us and asked if we wanted a picture
thinking it would be like Restaurant's, a complimentary A_Decor of us in a little cardboard S_Gift folder
the lady came back out with a A_Furniture frame folder, about 11x13" or so, with two of our A_Decor enclosed
granted, we didn't like how we looked in them, then S_Staff threw the O_Pay_Price at us of $60
heck no!  i'm not O_Payment that much for dinner A_Decor that we don't even like
we're not obligated to buy it, but it made me feel bad because the poor lady went through all that
i went Restaurant yesterday for Food with friends
the Food was pretty good, as usual (i had F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and my fiance had an alfredo Food, which he said wasn't that good) but this time the Service wasn't as superb
my fiance's silverware was dirty, and my pepsi F_FI_Taste flat
i ended up just drinking F_Drinks
our initial S_Staff mysteriously P_S_Stf_Availability/disappeared after getting our F_Drinks
another S_Staff took over and said that the other S_Staff had to "take off
" this was kind of confusing, because we saw S_Staff S_Staff other A_Fur_Table right by us
plus, i never like it when Restaurant are about 5 different people stopping by your A_Fur_Table
one S_Staff asked if we wanted more F_FoodItem, and we said yes, and then he never brought the F_FoodItem basket back
different people brought out our Food
and, nearing the end our S_Staff kept asking us if we needed Food (we were just sitting Restaurant talking), which made us feel like he wanted us to leave
i think we would have understood this had it been extremely busy and a long S_Del_Time, but Restaurant was hardly anyone Restaurant!
i used to hate carly's
i couldn't see the appeal
the Service is always abysmally slow
the seasonal tap is always empty - half the time the S_Staff don't even P_S_Stf_Experience/know what it is supposed to be filled with
the Food is
okay
a few of the F_FoodItem are really good, but the Food and vegan options are pretty A_Env_Size - when i started eating F_FoodItem again, i started liking the Food Restaurant a lot more
the place has grown on me the past couple years, though
they've started hiring some pretty good A_Ent_Music
the Food has been stepped up a little bit
unlike the lost leaf or roosevelt, the Restaurant is P_F_FI_Size/big enough to accommodate a healthy A_Env_Type without making conversation impossible
i guess i now feel that carly's is a-ok
accept the fact that S_Staff aren't trying particularly hard, and you'll be able to enjoy the convenience and relatively low O_Pay_Price of it all
best spot in the house, A_Entertainment A_OutsideView and shops/A_Decor A_OutsideView
problem was the Food was quite aweful
french F_Ingredients F_Appetizer, the filet F_FoodItem and even F_FoodItem was bad
the only had one seasoning, lots and lots and lots of F_Ingredients
what a great O_Experience! definitely coming back & bringing friends next time
between the constant Service, deliciously full flavored Food & the A_Environment
it has officially ranked on to my top 10 list!
amazing and a top of must do list in vegas!reserve for a half our before sunset and enjoy the ride
much better than the high roller
the S_Staff P_S_Stf_Behavior/accommodated our group of 8 with special birthday requests and beyond
we S_Delivery the tasting S_Menu and it was superb! seared F_FoodItem and fillet  2 inches P_F_FI_Size/thick, medium rare and perfect
Service was spot on and the A_OutsideView A_Entertainment was steady
we will eat Restaurant on our next visit
Food Service was good, prompt and friendly
this place offers your typical american Food fare at a O_Pay_Price which is average for vegas but more expensive that anywhere else in the usa
we had the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem hash with poached F_FoodItem
nice
however A_Fur_Table over from us had to send their Food F_FoodItem back because it was gristly
i was tossing up to give this 3 O_Exp_StarsByCus
but the F_FoodItem thing that let it down was the $O_Pay_Price charge for brewed F_Drinks
the F_Drinks was just terrible and i resented O_Payment for it at any O_Pay_Price
ok so i am a picky eater who tends to lean towards F_FI_Healthy and F_FI_Quality
while in vegas for the weekend, my bf and i decided to try nove italiano mainly bc we wanted a Restaurant with a nice A_Environment and a nice A_OutsideView
we figured, "ok Food, it will probably be pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary"were we wrong
this Food was unbelievable
in the beginning they bring you an assortment of P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem and breadsticks with a little tray on the side with F_FoodItem oil, red F_FoodItem F_Ingredients and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem for dipping
i dont usually partake in F_FoodItem, but i did try a thin F_Ingredients with the dippings and it was really good
after reading about the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem app on yelp, i figured we had to try it
let me tell you, it was amazing
obviously not for S_Staff bc its octopus, but it was so tender and the flavor of the F_FoodItem was simple but very very P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and a great flavor
F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled so they were P_F_FI_Taste/crispy
like nothing i have ever had before
the marinade was not too heavy, more like a ton of fresh F_Ingredients
i had the white F_FoodItem with clams
very simple but amazing
extremely P_F_FI_Size/thin F_FoodItem so you can eat F_FoodItem and not feel full or guilty
and P_F_FI_Size/big F_FoodItem and plenty of them on top
my bf got the F_FoodItem marsala
it was on the bone which at first seemed weird, but he said he loved it bc it fell off the bone
huge gourmet F_FoodItem and plenty of them
on the side he had penne F_FoodItem in alfredo F_Ingredients which he loved
it looked like it was fresh-made F_Ingredients and a bit lighter then what you would expect alfredo to be
we got a side of the aparagus special Food, which was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem with an F_FoodItem and ricotta F_FoodItem
sounds totally weird, i know, but so great!!the place is also swanky and upscale but comfortable, the A_OutsideView is great
overall this place is a must when in vegas
and the O_Pay_Price ,we thought, was very fair
we more than enough Food, and 1 glass of F_Drinks and a diet F_Drinks and the O_Payment was $125 with tip
not bad at all for a fine Restaurant in vegas
ok, Food but not outstanding
it was easy in and easy out, but the S_Menu seemes somewhat limited
my wife did not like the freshness or the the seasoning of the  F_FoodItem Restaurant
probably a good S_Menu with coupon for Food or Food, but you can do better
the only thing worse than their mediocre Food turns out to be their completely P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude and P_S_Stf_Behavior/condescending S_Staff
i have given ken's more business than they ever deserved over the past couple of years solely due to it's S_OpenHours proximity to home and work
the O_Experience i had Restaurant last weekend will certainly be my last
in the past i had S_Delivery things which didn't F_FI_Taste that fresh, one particular time i S_Delivery uni (sea urchin), a favorite of mine
i will forego any comparisons in F_FI_Taste for the sake of the weary, but let's just say it was horrible
so, i politely sent it back, only to be told when the S_Staff returned that uni was not in season
so, i should naturally know this? hmmm
how about you just apologize and not blame the customer for foolishly eating what you Service??the O_Experience this past weekend was very similar, the spicy yellowtail F_FI_Taste like it had been left in tupperware in the sun for a day or two, so i politely sent it back
i was told that perhaps yellowtail isn't my F_FoodItem, as though i had never had a F_Appetizer of F_FoodItem before in my life
apparently at ken's, the customer is always wrong
be warned, go elsewhere, like F_FoodItem eye or one of several others in the area who S_Staff F_FI_Quality Food without insult
as close to a nice night out as you can find in cu
the Food's always been solid, the F_Drinks good and the Service ok
however, A_Environment does get very P_A_Env_Type/noisy during the dinner hour
while it may not be a true 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus, for cu it deserves it
by the way, why does a city with such a strong F_FoodItem population have such a terrible Restaurant scene??  will Restaurant ever be any nice Restaurant?
the Food takes forever to be Service
the F_Ingredients on the side never come and most of the time you need to ask for them again
the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude, especially at the A_Plc_Bar
went Restaurant a couple of times cuz its really S_OpenHours to home
never went home P_O_Experience/satisfied
great Food, excellent Service!
good Food sadly A_Places have reduced as time as gone by, love their mongolian F_FoodItem, ok F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, sadly not the best i've had
nice place, but the Food is lacking
i tried the santa fe F_FoodItem and found it to be not very spicy
the Service was good and i will go Restaurant again because it is S_OpenHours to where i live
however, i would like a little more flavor
this Restaurant has a hip and modern vibe, reminds me of the w Restaurant or aloft Restaurant
i like how Restaurant are sofas that invite you to sit and chat, and how they transformed the A_Places between switch and schlotzsky's into a little A_OutsideView area
why you should eat at switch:-unique options (everything on the S_Menu looks good - Restaurant are so many different kinds of F_FoodItem!)-great flavor
i got the dragon F_FoodItem and it was really P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
on the downside, i had to eat it with a fork and a S_Cutlery because the F_Ingredients was dripping all over the place and they didn't give us any paper S_Cutlery
-freshness
although $10 seems a bit much for a F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem, it was justified when our Food came
all the F_Ingredients are fresh and high F_FI_Quality, and the A_Places are appropriate
even the F_Drinks F_FI_Taste really good!why i don't give switch 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus:-slow Service
we were sitting for about 8 S_Del_Time before the S_Staff came to ask what we wanted to F_Drinks
the S_Del_Time for our Food seemed like forever (c'mon, how long does it take to make a F_FoodItem?)
or maybe i'm just used to subway
strangely though, our S_Staff was amazingly P_S_Stf_Experience/quick to take away our S_Cutlery and bring the O_Payment
hmm
-the A_Decor
it was way too dark, it was actually darker inside than A_OutsideView
this may be personal preference, and of course it is a A_Plc_Bar, but next time i'm going Restaurant during the daytime for Food, and not dinner
-consistency
whereas the dragon F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was pretty ordinary
if you don't know what will turn out good, i'd advise choosing something with a S_Menu of eclectic F_Ingredients
finally, this Restaurant seems to be targeted more towards the 20-35 year old age group
i wouldn't advise coming Restaurant with children or your parents
unless you S_Delivery take-out
i'll sacrifice a lot for a great F_FoodItem, and Restaurant at F_FoodItem factory you get both great F_FoodItem and sacrifices
the slow-as-molasses Service and often-dirty A_Fur_Table: no biggie, since the F_FoodItem i get Restaurant comes covered in F_FoodItem spread and is chewy and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/boiled to true F_FoodItem perfection
so far, once of the best F_FoodItem i've had in the 'burgh
my A_Env_Type told me how amazing earl of F_FoodItem was, and i kept writing F_FoodItem off
it's a generic F_FoodItem place
inside a A_Entertainment
pass
but then i found myself at planet hollywood and a friend of mine was hungry, so i told him to try Food
he ate a F_FoodItem and was P_O_Experience/surprised how good it was, too
next time i found myself at the ph, i made a point to try it
i S_Delivery the original F_FoodItem, which is a roast F_Ingredients F_FoodItem with horseradish F_Ingredients
Restaurant was just as good as people have been saying
just a P_F_FI_Taste/tasty F_FoodItem on P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem for a great O_Pay_Price, especially as we were on the strip
i'm not going to drive down just to eat Restaurant, but i will try to snag this F_FoodItem again if i'm in the A_LocatedArea
my friend who came to visit me several months ago (in tandem with her step-mother, who came for a work convention) attended a corporate conference dinner at this Restaurant and donated her Food to me, Food were oh-so-P_F_FI_Taste/delicious as i was working two jobs at the time, and they'd been sitting in the fridge for several hours
that's why i decided to give lucille's a go when i was looking for a dinner spot with a friend of mine a couple of weeks ago
what a difference the lack of desperation makes
lucille's was basically an overly-A_Env_AC conditioned gigantic P_O_Experience/disappointment, with a hyperattentive young S_Staff who did his best, gosh darnit
the O_Pay_Price were high, to say the least, which is why my friend and i chose to share our Food, a full rack of F_FoodItem
with an F_Appetizer of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried green F_FoodItem (for the kitsch factor, of course
)  i'll just lay it out Restaurant, the Food was terrible
the F_FoodItem had practically no F_FoodItem on them, and i felt like i was just gnawing on sinewy bones for like ten minutes
it was gross to attempt, and probably worse to watch
the side S_Delivery of F_FoodItem was equally F_FoodItem, and i don't know how you even mess that up
the whole O_Experience was awkward, our conversation was continually interrupted by the P_S_Stf_Behavior/enthusiastic little S_Staff, and it was just so damn cold in Restaurant that we felt like we were being refrigerated
i will admit that we both P_O_Experience/enjoyed the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried green F_FoodItem, but it just isn't enough to save this place from its well-earned one O_Exp_StarsByCus review
to over-charge so horribly for the sorry excuse for F_FoodItem that they Service?  to subject their guests to the hokey "down-home" manufactured A_Decor when it might as well be an applebee's? i don't know
it was just all too much for me
when all was said and done, we O_Payment over 40 bucks for this totally subpar Food, and it was just weird
i'm sure my out-of-town friend had a better time at her stepmom's corporate shindig
but then again, they were all drunk
i'll make sure i'm good and sauced prior to my next visit to Restaurant
because that's the only way i could be convinced to return
this Restaurant is great
great Food and Service! the S_Staff eddy is why this is my favorite A_LocatedArea
he is always on point and you can tell runs the Restaurant well
had Food Restaurant saturday morning
the S_Del_Time S_Staff was super P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Availability/attentive
F_Drinks was very good
my problem is the Ambience per se
never been a big fan of the "A_Places" itself, when it was jams before
like a S_Parking garage that has been A_Decor
A_Ent_Music are horribly loud
and Restaurant weren't too many people when we were Restaurant
if Restaurant were more kids
would be very loud
the A_Placesr looks very uncomfortable
its A_Decor doesn't allow for legroom
what is with that?  S_Staff were very present and hands on
S_Staff seemed very happy
if you like the sort of Restaurant Ambience
this is the place for you
yes
this was exactly what i needed
S_Staff i go to is a marvel in efficiency and obviously the O_Pay_Price is right
make it a double and get a F_Ingredients F_Drinks for F_Dessert
you can't go wrong
this Restaurant is so tasty!  the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledgeable as well
i will definitely P_O_Experience/be_back
many times
Restaurant continues to be my "go to" spot when i am staying in the palazzo
good, F_Ingredients Food, great F_Drinks and S_Staff that are P_S_Stf_Behavior/personable and welcoming always make my evenings Restaurant a good one
on this visit, i S_Delivery the king F_FoodItem leg
at O_Pay_Price it seems like a splurge, but F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Size/huge, meaty and absolutely P_F_FI_Taste/delicious!F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was F_Ingredients and tasty and even my P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem was perfect
if you are not staying in the Restaurant- know that it is on the 2nd level of the A_Entertainment along with plenty of other Restaurant!always a good S_Menu!
either i am just easy to please or have been getting damn lucky on the places i have been spending my money at
anyhoo, i went to maizie's last night for $3 F_FoodItem night, best 3 bucks i have ever spent on a F_FoodItem! first off though when we got Restaurant it seemed like we would have a bit of a S_Del_Time, not so! S_Del_Time less than 10 S_Del_Time which was awesome because i was starving
for an F_Appetizer S_Delivery the buffalo F_FoodItem dip, so freaking P_F_FI_Taste/delish i could have eaten another! i had bacon and F_FoodItem jack F_FoodItem added to my F_FoodItem but it was so filling i could only eat half
my Food this morning, the other half! F_FI_Taste great heated up too
for my F_FI_Taste F_Drinks i had F_Drinks which was perfect, not to sweet, not to sour
the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Availability/attentive and the S_Staff watching was great
this wasn't my first time at maizie's and it won't be my last either
although Service was good, my F_Drinks was seriously F_Drinks down
to the point of me almost saying, can i just get a F_Drinks on the rocks? seriously
basically i O_Payment O_Pay_Price total for two F_Drinks with a splash of F_Drinks
it reminded me of hearing kat williams say, if your F_Drinks is really, really dark like blood, that is because you didn't S_Delivery F_Drinks buddy so sit your broke a$$ down
i actually O_Payment for some F_Drinks and got none
i am not asking you to pour like i am F_FoodItem, but man, can you add a little bit of spirits to my F_Drinks? that would be lovely, thanks!  i wasn't the only one with this issue as another member of our party complained about the exact same thing
over a short period of time this place has gone to the F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem and other F_Ingredients cream F_FoodItem are now P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen as a matter of course
F_Drinks selection is poor and badly made F_Drinks is accepted
hipsters seem to accept the off hand Service and lack of attention to detail as a badge of honor
sadly the hype has done amelie's a great disservice
i hope they can remedy it i used to love the Restaurant
went to stratta to watch the Food
O_Payment O_Pay_Price for a three course Food, 2 well F_Drinks or a pitcher of F_Drinks and a A_Fur_Table in front of the A_Ent_Tv
if you ever want to watch the A_Entertainment in vegas, i highly P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant
it was the best S_Menu we could have made for the weekend
totally Worthiness it! the F_Appetizer of buffalo F_FoodItem and calamari were the perfect football watching Food
and P_F_FI_Size/large enough for us to share
for the F_FoodItem Food, i had the rigatoni and F_FoodItem and the wife had the F_FoodItem in clam F_Ingredients
both solid
for F_Dessert
it came with the Food F_FoodItem or F_Ingredients cream
the vanilla F_Ingredients cream was the "worst" thing we had Restaurant
it was just eh
but the Food F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/yummy and rich
the S_Staff were great and provided awesome Service
i don't know if i'd Restaurant Restaurant during a regular trip to lv, but for the F_FoodItem, this place is on top of my list
seriously?P_F_FI_Price/cheap 'vietnamese' Food with a plateau O_Pay_Price tag
my friend S_Delivery the F_FoodItem, and then remembered S_Staff needed to ask about any F_Ingredients in the F_Ingredients due to an F_FI_Healthy and they just brought us out the jar of F_Ingredients, complete with O_Pay_Price tag of O_Pay_Price  maybe lots of Restaurant do this, but it's pretty P_O_Experience/disappointing
i had the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem, and it tasted just like any other miscellaneous asian stir fry with the same mix of F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients in a fairly good portion F_FI_Size
i haven't had their F_Appetizer, so maybe they are amazing, and the spring F_FoodItem was ok, but everything else on their S_Menu is basically F_FoodItem + F_FoodItem + (jar?) F_Ingredients
O_Pay_Price gets you F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem and spring F_FoodItem or F_Appetizer
this is definitely not schezuan
also, strangely enough: we had a O_Reservation on a saturday and were seated right away but the same 3 groups of people were waiting to be A_Fur_Table from the time we arrived and throughout our entire Food even though we were sitting Restaurant facing three empty A_Fur_Table? so, make a O_Reservation, i suppose
went for Food with my family and it was very busy because it's sunday afternoon
my Food was great but had to S_Del_Time for someone to clean off the A_Fur_Table
otherwise this A_LocatedArea is always nice and clean
this place is a fast good P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem option, much better than the other corporate spots
pros:spicy cajun style breading
good family combo options
grey area:F_FoodItem seems to be out of a bag or from powder
F_FoodItem seems to be pre-made too
cons:F_FoodItem they give you are kirkland dinner F_FoodItem, they just warm them under a heat lamp
can't stand bogus F_FoodItem, or at least don't let me see you pulling them out of a kirkland package
also, it seems that their is a moderate probability that if you go in Restaurant when it's slow, you might get F_FoodItem that has been sunbathing under said heatlamps for hours
if i need P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, i definitely consider this place; however, it's not the best and it's not the worst
the value is great and the fixin's adequately fill their role
you be the judge
in terms of it's name, it's appearance, it's attitude and S_Menu, always sunday is quite unique on the royal mile, and is more the type of place you'd expect to find in bruntsfield or somewhere
it's not perhaps the best P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant and tearoom in edinburgh, but on a street loaded with utter dives such as rabbie burns Restaurant and garfunkel's, it's certainly some way ahead of it's neighbours
especially good with a A_Furniture A_Fur_Table and a newspaper
this will be short and simple! amazing Food, amazing Ambience with the A_Ent_Music man playing
S_Staff was a bit bitchy and didn't say a word when we walked in or when S_Staff seated us
told S_Staff i had a O_Reservation for four, S_Staff looked at me (up and down) and then grabbed a few S_Menu and rushed us to a cramped A_Fur_Table
our S_Staff had more of a S_Stf_Appearance and was great, until we all decided to move to the A_Ent_Music A_Places and the S_Staff A_Places was 15 S_Del_Time too long in even noticing us as we sat
really? Restaurant was us and two other A_Fur_Table
how hard can it be! oh wait, that's because S_Staff and miss bitchy bitch S_Staff were too busy playing chatty cathy at the S_Staff station
sigh
friday night, we were heading to Restaurant for the first time and it looked loud and packed, we were looking for some place to talk
since ocean prime was right next door and didn't look quite as busy, we decided to stop in Restaurant instead
this place has a very upscale Ambience and i immediately thought it was going to be a pricey night and i was right
we went to the lovely A_Plc_Bar to seat and i S_Delivery some sort of F_FoodItem F_Drinks, it had a F_FoodItem F_Ingredients ball in the center and it came with enough for 2 F_Drinks so it was worth the $14 O_Pay_Price tag
my boyfriend S_Delivery a F_Drinks and that also came with enough for 2
we had the best S_Del_Time at ocean prime, Restaurant was live A_Ent_Music and they were singing some of the P_F_FI_Quality/old F_FoodItem
when they started A_Ent_Music "doin the butt" i ran on the dance A_Places and danced my butt off
this is the kind of Restaurant where you can leave your purse unattended which i did to go dance
i decided to try something to eat so i S_Delivery the ahi F_FoodItem tartare with F_Ingredients
it came out and looked so pretty i felt like i shouldn't wat it
but i did
hahaha Food was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
F_FoodItem wasn't like F_FoodItem i've had in the past though, this kinda tasted like F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
when our friend arrived we decided to try some F_Drinks
we both had a glass of F_Drinks which was absolutely delicious and sweet, almost like a reisling
oh F_FoodItem was very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty and i do P_O_Experience/recommend it
my boyfriend and i danced the night away Restaurant until they were S_OpenHours up
we will P_O_Experience/be_back
Food smelled F_FI_Taste when we walked in (2 of us), asked for a A_Fur_Table, 2 S_Staff consulted each other, one S_Staff said it would be a 5 S_Del_Time S_Del_Time, just sit at the A_Plc_Bar and we'll get you when your A_Fur_Table ready
sat at the A_Plc_Bar, 1 woman on one end watching A_Ent_Tv halfway thru her Food, a couple halfway thru their Food on the other, we chose the middle seats allowing 3 empty A_Furniture either side of us, so we are pretty visible and alarmingly drinkless and S_Menu-less
S_Staff made no eye contact for 10 S_Del_Time despite walking back and forth several times S_Staff the already eating Food
we then saw 3 ladies walk in who also were told to S_Del_Time at the A_Plc_Bar til their A_Fur_Table was ready
so in the ten S_Del_Time we were at the A_Plc_Bar, those girls who arrived after us were Service F_Drinks and handed S_Menu, A_Plc_Bar back walked past the S_Staff who saw we were sitting Restaurant awkwardly asked us if we needed Food, told him we were S_Del_Time for a A_Fur_Table, brought us F_Drinks, we asked barback for 2 shots F_Drinks, he told the S_Staff and went to do his other duties
so ten S_Del_Time after that i watch the S_Staff make 6 F_Drinks for a S_Staff, S_OpenHours out the 3 ladies tab as the S_Staff sat them to a A_Fur_Table, (mind you they came in about 10 minutes after us), still no shots we S_Delivery or eye contact from S_Staff as he passed us a dozen more S_Del_Time
so 30 S_Del_Time later, our S_Staff skipped us and gave away our A_Fur_Table, S_Staff ignores us, 2 different S_Staff forgets about us, shots S_Delivery forgotten about, we look around for assistance, S_Staff deems not important to remind S_Staff we've been S_Del_Time for a A_Fur_Table
we get up slowly making our way to the door, S_Staff notices us and we leave
Service from S_Staff: negative 10service from S_Staff: just plain for got about us
Service from barback: outstanding
so if you are a cute couple looking for good Service and wanting to eat something, Food, look else where,  if you are 3 nice looking cougars, don't worry, the S_Staff will easily ignore S_Del_Time patrons and skip the others before you and A_Fur_Table you priority
never P_O_Experience/coming_back, don't like being ignored and forgotten
F_FoodItem F_FoodItem did smell good though
(don't know if that's on the S_Menu because never received one
)
good O_Pay_Price
polite and fast Service
great O_Experience
P_F_FI_Taste/yummy F_FoodItem
my girlfriend and i ad the opportunity to stop in the Restaurant on a sunday afternoon and after a 15 minute S_Del_Time, was seated at two A_Fur_Table near the back by a S_Staff stand
we S_Delivery two of the F_FoodItem so got a good range of Food's and sides
the Food was excellent, the F_FoodItem (white F_FoodItem) was tender and the F_FoodItem was smoked through wonderfully
i was not a huge fan of the F_FoodItem, but it was different and i would not hesitate to S_Delivery it as an F_Appetizer
i also had the F_Drinks and Restaurant was a nice range of F_Drinks to compliment the Food
S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and Service was fast but we never felt rushed at all
i will definitely stop in next time i'm in town
we have been Restaurant countless times
it's the best Food in A_LocatedArea
first of all, we are local las vegans
we've been to a lot of F_FoodItem, but mostly we steer away from the strip Restaurant
secondly, we found Restaurant which cater to locals usually offer F_FI_Quality F_FoodItem for the money
the S_Menu is incredible Restaurant
after many visits, we still have Food that we have not tried yet
my favorite is F_FoodItem over some P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh greens for F_FoodItem with galic F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem with artisan F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/steamed clam, diced F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem short F_FoodItem
for F_Dessert, F_Ingredients sweet and nicely sliced F_FoodItem, creamy F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem, fluffy and A_Decor F_FoodItem short F_FoodItem, and smooth F_Dessert
on top of all these, they offer F_Drinks and F_Drinks which is included in the Food
this was a total waste of 3 hours
Service: glacialfood: crappydessert: disgustingoverall: overhypedif you like the F_Dessert factory, you'll probably like this Restaurant
if you like actual Food, run far far away
the F_FoodItem were F_Ingredients and not cooked properly
the F_FoodItem were cold and F_FI_Taste
the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen F_FoodItem that has somehow earned rave reviews was disgustingly sweet
the F_FoodItem was unpleasant
the only good thing about Restaurant is that it's a great way to differentiate idiots
if someone likes this Restaurant, then you know that you can safely ignore any other Service that they might make
if they don't like this Restaurant, then you have a higher probability of getting a Service that's useful
we had Food Restaurant during a layover at the airport
our S_Staff was awesome
i wish i could remember S_Staff name
S_Staff was so nice and P_S_Stf_Behavior/polite with his north carolina accent and hospitality
the Restaurant were really good and one of the better ones that i have had in a long time
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem for Food and thought it was very good if you like F_FoodItem
i would definitely P_O_Experience/come_back if i were on a layover
i think it is one of the better Food places in the airport
went Restaurant before a hockey A_Entertainment, and got F_FoodItem and a local F_Drinks, i think it was the kiltlifter
the O_Pay_Price were reasonable, the F_FoodItem were just P_F_FI_Taste/spicy enough, and the F_Drinks was good
the F_Drinks was P_O_Experience/recommended by a S_Staff when i told him that i usually F_Drinks stone or sam adams
can't complain
i had originally seen the other listing for this Restaurant which had the place O_Exp_StarsByCus at four O_Exp_StarsByCus rather than 2
75; and after being Restaurant i wish i would have seen this one first
75 O_Exp_StarsByCus is the perfect place for the ratings to rest - la parrilla suiza is lackluster, tolerable mexican Food at it's best
to be fair - the S_Staff is extremely nice and P_S_Stf_Availability/attentive
being a sunday early afternoon it was imperative that my F_Drinks was replenished frequently and it was
our S_Staff was great!  the Food itself was pretty good as well - i S_Delivery an F_FoodItem and had the tortilla F_Appetizer which was very good
the part that knocks a plausible four O_Exp_StarsByCus down to three is the lack of character in the Restaurant - it's just a big, open, A_LocatedArea with vaguely mexican-oriented A_Decor
the O_Pay_Price was average for A_Places - ranging from about O_Pay_Price a S_Cutlery
Restaurant is a full A_Plc_Bar which i would have definitely taken advantage of had it not been a sunday and the F_Drinks been less than O_Pay_Price a piece
overall - if it's not too out of your way and you're in a bind, Restaurant won't be the worst S_Menu
i'd much rather head to either an Restaurant like salazar brothers or a slightly more upscale place like el zocalo
this is an amazing Restaurant and a jewel of a find in az!  when you step into the restaurant you are immediately transported from the southwest to A_LocatedArea!  i was shocked
yes
really shocked to find to find the Restaurant
all of the S_Staff love the Restaurant and specialize in one thing or another
the Food, F_Drinks, A_Environment, and F_Drinks (yes, absinthe) are spot on!  dustin is the S_Staff and knows his stuff about french F_Drinks
try the F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem, and the F_FoodItem!  you won't be P_O_Experience/disappointed
most important!!!!!! have the F_Drinks!! it's prepare authentically and is fantastic
bottom line:  this is a must try Restaurant anywhere
it's one of my new favorite Restaurant!!!!!!
i had an excellent O_Experience at this family owned Restaurant A_LocatedArea in a cute A_LocatedAreal, quebec
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem filled with F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
Food were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
i also had the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, both of which were the best i have ever had
the Service was excellent, but Restaurant is a place to go for the incredible Food
the 'F_FoodItem does offer a S_Menu of F_Drinks and our house special pie was generously topped
i'd still O_Exp_StarsByCus the F_FoodItem only slightly above average at a high O_Pay_Price
better part of a O_Pay_Price O_Payment for a medium and two drafts
Service continues to be spotty and indifferent
the dishwasher must not be working properly as the S_Cutlery was also spotty
and i hate when i have to straighten S_Cutlery tines
i'm thinking the best option Restaurant is happy hour drafts and F_Appetizer
good thing i've eaten Restaurant before
the Food has been amazing but the last S_Del_Time i was Restaurant i was so pounded that i remember S_Delivery a F_FoodItem as soon as we sat down
the next thing i remember is like a snap-shot of my red F_Drinks sitting on the white A_Fur_Table cloth, then i woke up in my Restaurant A_Plc_DiningRoom the next morning
don't even remember eating this time but the Food has always been great
open letter to the S_Staff:Restaurant is something you seem not to know about your wait S_Staff, they try to take advantage of your customers by O_Pay_Method the change on a ticket
let's say a ticket totaled O_Pay_Price, and i gave S_Staff a $20 and a $10, what should i have gotten in change? why any 3rd grader will tell you $12
69 (broken into 1's and a $5)
what i got was O_Pay_Price even, O_Pay_Method me you $0
69
is this a big deal? not once it's not but after having this S_Stf_Behavior happen at your Ambience several times it has become a habit with your S_Staff, assuming the change
to compound this, this particular S_Staff i had called this on S_Staff before
i had also informed S_Staff before and so obviously nothing had been done
did i get pissed off, yeah
i certainly did (and admittedly a bit over the top)
did a S_Staff both to ask why i was so upset
no
ok
so i'm 86'ed from your little place
plenty of places to eat in vegas, but you should know that your S_Staff is not as P_S_Stf_Behavior/honest with your customers as you would like to think and your S_Staff on the street is reflecting of this
i had been warned (by a former S_Staff of yours) that this was the "inside baseball" thing that happened Restaurant but i couldn't believe it
obviously it was true
the shame of it all is unfortunately this sort of S_Stf_Behavior has spread to other places, and i would assume it is the economy that spurs this on
the funny thing is, when a S_Staff brings me my O_Payment the other way (so maybe i get a few cents extra back), i usually am sure to O_Payment it back and then some, and people who know me know i am not a cheap O_Payment
(unless you assume the change and then i am likely to leave nothing at all, seeing as how you've taken your O_Payment already
)so yeah, Restaurant, but be sure to fire your wait S_Staff, they are doing you a great disservice
and now you know what gets gossiped about your Ambience, a rare thing for S_Staff to learn, and i'd use it if i were you

Restaurant was the final stop last night to conclude some birthday debauchery for one of my best friends
phil, the S_Staff, was fantastic in letting us play endless rounds of A_Plc_Bar, and F_Drinks F_Drinks to our hearts' desire
Restaurant wasn't very busy, however, the pool A_Fur_Table/Restaurant side of the A_Plc_Bar looked like a hurricane had hit it
F_Drinks bottles, pint glasses, papers all over the Restaurant
i'm not sure if S_Staff was shorthanded but this Restaurant was a mess before we got Restaurant
regardless, we all had a good time and accomplished our mission of b-day fun for my buddy
fantastic!  Food was great and unique
S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Availability/attentive, P_S_Stf_Behavior/humorous and P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledgeable
i would P_O_Experience/recommend multiple visits because everything we tried was great
we actually went two nights in a row
i Restaurant Restaurant the other day and it was a unique O_Experience
the Restaurant from the A_OutsideView is nothing like the A_Decor on the inside
the A_Decor itself P_O_Experience/surprised me because it's a very oriental A_Decor setting
it's a very nice change from the A_Decor setting A_Decor Restaurant
Restaurant A_Decor reminds me of the A_Decor Restaurant they have in china
they had high A_Decor A_Fur_Table which created a sense of intimacy but i could still Restaurant the people sitting behind be talking
the A_Decor A_Decor to the S_Cutlery we used to F_Drinks caught my attention and made them stick out
they Service barley F_Drinks instead of F_Drinks with thin S_Cutlery as S_Cutlery
it was great to try but we requested F_Drinks shortly after
i didn't like the F_Drinks and i am a heavy F_Drinks drinker
we S_Delivery the kalbi S_Cutlery as well as the spicy F_Appetizer
the Food came out quickly after we S_Delivery
the spicy F_Appetizer had great flavor and the F_FoodItem was cooked well done, like we asked
my overall first time O_Experience was great
we S_Delivery the F_FoodItem
it was a little stronger than what i've had before but it was good
it was only O_Pay_Price for a large F_FI_Size of soju
i also noticed the F_Drinks for only O_Pay_Price a pint and $13 a pitcher which i thought was a great O_Pay_Price!the only aspect of holding me back on rating this place a O_Exp_StarsByCus is the language barrier i had with our S_Staff
the S_Staff spoke enough english to take our S_Delivery but not to explain clearly some of the Food on the S_Menu we had questions about
it was hard to understand what he was saying even though he was trying to pronounce his words slower
S_Accessibility was a little difficult through out our time at dining Restaurant
love this Restaurant!! one of my favorites! Service is always great!Food is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, a few of my favorites are: F_FoodItem with P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem, the pulled F_FoodItem, the bulgogi F_FoodItem and the F_FoodItem
i can never get enough of komex!!ps: their homemade hot F_Ingredients is a must try!
this Restaurant was really great
friendly, warm Service
not to mention, probably the best chinese Food i've had in madison
i'll definitely be P_O_Experience/going_back
such a good F_FoodItem!! so juicy and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious!! lots of S_Menu and they are all
free (except for a select few)!! their fries are ok
i prefer in-n-outs better, but i'll live
my biggest complaint is the O_Pay_Price
it takes W_Waiting than any fast Food joint to get your F_FoodItem and it's double the O_Pay_Price
yes, F_FoodItem are P_F_FoodItem/delicious, but it's still just a F_FoodItem
i do really like the fact that they have peanuts to F_Appetizer on while you're S_Del_Time! that does help
be prepared to be wow'd! windsor is one of the best spots in phoenix if you are looking for amazing Food, great F_Drinks, awesome atmosphere, and possibly the best S_Staff Restaurant is
it is great for F_FoodItem night, or just getting together with friends! the overall O_Experience for me was one of the best Restaurant is
i had the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and it was more than enough Food and was so good
my friends both got F_FoodItem and they absolutely loved them
i think that one thing that sets Restaurant over most other spots in phoenix is the S_Staff! like postino before it, windsor's S_Staff is awesome and make you feel like part of the A_Env_Type the second you walk in the A_Fur_Door! i have and will continue to send people to Restaurant! so far every person i have told to go Restaurant has text or called me the next day thanking me because they loved it so much! go
you won't regret it!
if you live out here in phoenix there are a number of good F_FoodItem places, many of which have a strongly southern focus on F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, specifically F_FoodItem and pulled F_FoodItem with the F_FoodItem Service already F_FoodItem with or covered in F_Ingredients
texas F_FoodItem, at least from my own personal O_Experience (born in texas and raised Restaurant till i was twelve and moved to hawaii, which has a very different type of F_FoodItem), is generally P_F_FI_Quality/dry rubbed and smoked and any F_Ingredients is put on after you get your Food, at your discretion, and of course, thanks to the bountiful supply of cattle in the early years of the state Restaurant is a strong focus on F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and in addition, thanks to the many german settlers, it is also known for some great smoked sausage (in fact, if you find yourself in corpus christie take a drive out and go to F_FoodItem grove, a small town, at least when i was Restaurant 20 years ago that is very german and wow, the sausage, but that is another story)
well, this place, based on the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (always my ultimate test of texas F_FoodItem) makes some great F_FoodItem and even better, it has the bare bones approach to F_FI_Price that is standard in many little texas F_FoodItem joints and many great Food hole in the A_Decor places in general
it's not in, to say the least, the fancy part of town, all transactions are done in O_Pay_Price so leave your credit card at home, and the Food is provided on an empty F_Drinks crate bottom sort of thing with a piece of butcher paper on it and then the sliced F_FoodItem of your S_Menu is on another piece of butcher paper and when they ask how many slices of F_FoodItem you want, and you reply, they reach into the drawer below the O_Pay_Price register, rip open a F_Ingredients of sliced wonder F_FoodItem (or the equivalent) and give you that to make the F_FI_Religious folded F_FoodItem of sliced F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_Ingredients on F_FoodItem
you can also get a F_FoodItem special but i'm a traditionalist, i'll make my own
in addition, i have an obsession with F_Ingredients F_FoodItem at F_FoodItem places (once again, an offshoot of the german influence, i would think, on texas F_FoodItem Food and boy, the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem Restaurant is classic F_Ingredients F_FoodItem
oh, and to F_Drinks, if you are off work, they do have shiner bock, in the bottle, along with a number of other F_Drinks and if you look up the shiner brewery website, you will once again, see the strong german influence and one thing that i don't think is german, but definitely texas, country A_Ent_Music on the sound track
now, for those looking for a luxury O_Experience, you may need to go to joe's F_FoodItem, which two of my 3 dining companions said they liked better (the whole slices of wonder F_FoodItem did not excite them, but one of the people, along with me, was sold on this place
it is very authentic texas hole-in-the-A_Decor F_FoodItem and it does that well and if you are looking for something other than the no-frills approach to the F_FoodItem O_Experience, then some other place may be more to your liking
i usually don't take the time to write reviews, so you can bet that this Restaurant is special
definitely got a local Food vibe when we arrived, but the S_Staff were great
everything is made fresh to S_Delivery right in front of you
they have 3 hibernate F_FoodItem stations for each type of F_FoodItem on the S_Menu
i P_O_Experience/recommend the adobado and asada F_FoodItem
if want a P_F_FI_Taste/delicious alternative to F_FoodItem, try the adobado fries
F_FoodItem are piled high in a P_F_FI_Size/large to go box with P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, cream F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_Ingredients
very P_F_FI_Taste/delish!!!   i grew up on mexican Food and this Restaurant is as authenticate as it gets!!
the Food is good
if you're stuck uptown and want some "q" as it were, this is a great place to get it
it's exactly what you might imagine an "uptown F_FoodItem" joint would be like
busy A_Plc_Bar, "club" type A_Ent_Music, "fancier" country fare (if that makes sense - this ain't no paw's country cookin') and a generally more "uptown" clientele
don't get me wrong, it was tasty, if P_F_FI_Price/pricey, Food - pulled F_FoodItem with a bevy of F_Ingredients to choose from, F_FoodItem, mac & F_FoodItem, hushpuppies
it might be a tad ambitious - the night i was Restaurant (granted it was a saturday night, right before a bobcats A_Entertainment), the Service was slow and it seemed like the A_Plc_Kitchen was very backed up - i wonder if they have too many A_Fur_Table
see rachel c's review which kind of hits the nail on the head
i came with friends on a friday night around 7
was told 30-45 S_Del_Time for a A_Fur_Table, which turned out to be more like 15 S_Del_Time
meanwhile a S_Staff stopped by and took F_Drinks S_Delivery while we S_Del_Time -- nice touch!one thing struck me upon entry:  why are we in the middle of east liberty and Restaurant are only two
umm
non-white people in the whole Ambience?  i'm just sayin, the clientele doesn't at all match the A_Environment
and this is my A_Environment
i was skeptical
the potential answer?  the O_Pay_Price
all sides are a la carte at around O_Pay_Price
and that includes a slice of F_FoodItem   you're gonna O_Payment for your Food ($10-$22) plus a side or two ($5) plus a F_Drinks ($9 for a whiskey F_Drinks)
not exactly a P_F_FI_Price/cheap Food for pittsburgh
that said
i wanted to bad mouth this Restaurant
but the Food made up for it
the F_FoodItem were perfect
the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem?  the best we've ever had in pittsburgh
the F_FoodItem was amazing
bottom S_Del_OrderingMethod:  we'll P_O_Experience/be_back
hell, maybe tomorrow
except we left with enough Food that Food is already taken care of
went Restaurant for Food with a co-worker and Food was good
very clean and Food was F_Ingredients and hot
theives; that is all i can say
was staying at A_Places next door
we went to use the internet Restaurant and after we O_Payment we went on computers to print out airplane tickets
then the S_Staff comes by and then tells us to stand back and he will get us a O_Payment because the machine wasn't working
then S_Staff comes back and doesn't give us the O_Payment and tells us the leave
we short O_Pay_Price and left without printing out tickets
i would O_Exp_StarsByCus this place 0 O_Exp_StarsByCus on Service if i could
** this review is not about Food
what a beautiful Restaurant!! luv the A_Decor & the A_Decor!! the A_OutsideView of the A_OutsideView is done superbly!! and the Food, very very good! delishhhh!!!a perfect place to take someone special!! S_Staff are in good A_Places!i P_O_Experience/enjoyed my dinner with the girls!!!
it's me and my bestfriends birthday! we wanna do a girls comp dinner somewhere
Restaurant it is! it's eight of us girls
we are A_Fur_Table at a round A_Fur_Table and two of us decide to go to the A_Plc_Bar to get some F_Drinks
we asked if they still do the first round of F_Drinks for Offers? he said yes
so we got eight F_Drinks and back to our A_Fur_Table to down them
our S_Staff S_Delivery F_Drinks to the other girls while we were gone and then i S_Delivery a F_Drinks and he promptly S_Delivery them
Food Service started
bagatelle F_FoodItem - pretty much giant F_Ingredients leaves with some type of F_Ingredients
F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem for Food and mashed F_Ingredients and F_FoodItem for sides
so Restaurant are eight of us girls, and for the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and the F_FoodItem, Restaurant are four pieces each
so we all just split everything
this was my first time Restaurant for Food but someone within our group had been Restaurant several S_Del_Time before and said the had always gotten a lot more Food than what we had just been Service
Food was all good though, P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, but i could have had more! we did have a vegetarian among us though and the S_Staff did accommodate S_Staff and brought out a vegetarian risotto Food that was pretty freakin' good too! oh and of course i checked in on yelp and a check in offer popped up for a free S_Cutlery of F_Drinks! i asked our S_Staff martin about it and he said he would ask his S_Staff
griffin came over and i A_Entertainment him the check in and asked him if he would honor that? i know we are getting a Food, but it doesn't hurt to ask! S_Staff was very nice and said that was cool and then we all got a S_Cutlery of the F_Drinksfor F_Dessert we had little P_F_FI_Size/tiny F_FoodItem
not very much F_FI_Taste involved, and i think they torched the tops of them a little too much but whatever - we scarfed those down
S_Del_Time to check out with our S_Staff and head to ellis island
the O_Payment comes and it is $89
apparently Restaurant was some misunderstanding about F_Drinks
we had S_Delivery those shots from the A_Plc_Bar and i guess the S_Staff had transferred those over to our tab and then we had S_Delivery a round of F_Drinks but thought our S_Staff had said those were comp'd but only the shots got comp'd
it's not that we didn't want to O_Payment for F_Drinks or Food, it's just that when you think something is taken care of and then it isn't we're like wtf??? not a big deal anyway, we O_Payment and hooked our S_Staff up and then we on our merry little ways to
ellis island! would i P_O_Experience/come_back Restaurant? yes, but either with less people or a better understanding of what and how much they are actually going to S_Staff us!  the S_Staff was all very nice and Service was good and we had a lot of fun!
very good and run by S_Staff from israel
you won't be P_O_Experience/disappointed!
if you're having a case of the munchies at 11pm, make sure to check out the Offers S_Menu at yonaka to take advantage of discounted O_Pay_Price on some Food and F_Drinks
even for dinner, O_Pay_Price are pretty reasonable compared to lot of F_FI_Quality japanese Restaurant S_Staff this caliber of Food
if it's your first S_Del_Time Restaurant, the F_FoodItem is the way to go
the Ambience is nice for a F_FoodItem night and the Service is prompt and friendly
almost everything is good Restaurant
standing out from their regular S_Menu were the uni to ikura Food, wagyu F_FoodItem and the seared foie gras F_FoodItem
the latter is just so buttery, it melts in your mouth
Restaurant are also several must-try Food on their Offers S_Menu like the F_FoodItem; the sake orenji which consists of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem on top of sweet F_FoodItem and special F_Ingredients; and the chuka F_FoodItem which are F_FI_Taste F_FoodItem belly baos
don't care what those talking chihuahuas say, this is the Restaurant to go for fourth Food
with more P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Food to try, yonaka is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to eat
discovered this gem during a vintage staycation! had Food on the A_Plc_Patio, loved the decore! my Food was good
hubs Food was better! love the sirracha (?) F_Ingredients! and of course the F_FoodItem next S_Del_Time getting the Food had so much fun on the seesaw! haven't giggled like that in a while! going back for brunch in a few weeks
my wife and i went for an early dinner last saturday and i have to say i am P_O_Experience/impressed
the Food was great and the Service was attentive
it's so nice to have a comfortable F_FoodItem place so S_OpenHours
it is a good Ambience and great Service
i definitely P_O_Experience/recommend going Restaurant
gem!!! what a fantastic P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant
exceptional Food and even better Service
you can feel the fresh F_Ingredients and the F_FoodItem cooks right in front of you
the S_Staff comes out and pours a F_Dessert F_Drinks
this is a piece of italy in american southwest
dont miss
this F_Ingredients Food Restaurant it the real deal
everything is made fresh to S_Delivery
oh mcfadden's where to start
i've never been to a place that was soooo obsessed with trying to create the illusion of fun than promoting it
every 5 mins you have your deja vu(esque) A_Ent_Music calling for people to get on the A_Plc_Bar and dance
which is fine
but 1
some people aren't meant to be dancing on A_Plc_Bar but might be better suited being pushed off them
kind of sucks trying to get a F_Drinks when you have to navigate people nasty feet
the majority of people on the A_Plc_Bar are "S_Staff" (i use that term liberally) which means less people dealing with customers behind the A_Plc_Bar
which means S_Del_Time longer to get a stupid F_Drinks
the easiest way to get a F_Drinks would be to grow boobs and work Restaurant because every S_Del_Time i looked around their S_Staff were able to F_Drinks more than i could even S_Delivery
mcfadden's will be another cadillac F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients house, and coconuts
i appreciate trying to create this party atmosphere but not at the expense of the customers
we just had Food!!! it was pretty good!!!this is a new A_LocatedArea and it seems where ever they open a new A_LocatedArea they do well! i would P_O_Experience/recommend Food over mcdonalds any day! i believe this is long enough to be posted!
the Food is Food, the head S_Staff is rude and the Service is slow
a big upgrade from the robbie foxx days
very good for big groups
great atmosphere
A_OutsideView also very noteworthy
the S_Menu is nothing extraordinary - but - it doesn't matter
its a great Restaurant to hang out
S_Staff is very good
we P_O_Experience/enjoyed the F_FoodItem and atmosphere at this Restaurant
husband got the pulled F_FoodItem w/ F_Ingredients F_FoodItem and i got the F_FoodItem platter
his F_FoodItem was too P_F_FI_Size/big and messy to pick up right away but F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
my S_Cutlery had tons of F_FoodItem which i only like 1/3 of it
i also had the cheesy F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients
Food was P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
i liked the Ambience b/c it was laid back
half of the A_Env_Type had small kids but the A_Ent_Music, A_Ent_Tv and noise level was perfect so that the kids can be themselves and loud w/o bothering others
visitung arizona because a S_OpenHours A_Env_Type friend is going to a treatment center for stomach cancer
S_Staff has no F_Appetizer but nourish had Food that was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and F_FI_Healthy for S_Staff
we didn't S_Del_Time to long for our Food to be ready
S_Staff got a yogurt S_Cutlery in the A_Furniture that S_Staff loved and ate for Food the next morning
we will defiantly O_Experience while visiting
thank you nourish
cool concept, but not fully executed to its potential
it is a baked F_Ingredients/mashed F_Ingredients A_Plc_Bar where you choose all of your F_Ingredients
the O_Pay_Price was right, but the F_Ingredients didn't seem as F_Ingredients as they should or could be
the S_Staff had their friends/A_Env_Type in the Restaurant and they were extremely loud
it was Ambience being the only O_Payment customer in the Restaurant
the first time i have ever asked my S_Staff to get me the S_Menu for a Food! the F_FoodItem is hands down one of the best Food i've ever had
great Restaurant to celebrate our anniversary!
the S_Staff that P_S_Stf_Behavior/helped me was very nice
however for F_FI_Price i expect F_FI_Size out of my F_FoodItem
i had the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, which wasn't bad, but F_FoodItem wasn't great
honestly i could get a better, less P_F_FI_Price/expensive F_FoodItem at Restaurant or Restaurant
i love this Restaurant  huge S_Menu of F_FoodItem and more on the S_Menu
all very tempting, but from the first time we visited we tried the F_FoodItem and have been hooked ever since!!the F_FoodItem is the best i've had ever - anywhere!  and the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem that come with them are to die for!!  i don't know how they do it, F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Size/thin, P_F_FI_Taste/crisp, potatoey and very onioney
i love F_FoodItem!!  it only makes me sad that i live in durham and only get to this Restaurant about once a year
i did switch once and try the F_FoodItem, which was P_F_FI_Size/big and lovely and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty with all the powdered F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients, but i really missed my F_FoodItem bennie and F_Ingredients F_FoodItem and have never looked back
oh, you must try it and btw, get the F_FoodItem and applesauce for the tater F_FoodItem
ever just want excellent mexican Food for your party, just like mama used to make but without the days of preparation and cooking?  we S_Delivery from comedor's catering S_Menu:  green F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (substitution of their F_FoodItem) and F_FoodItem for our halloween party
surprisingly, comedor also included a quart F_FI_Size of F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and two big bags of tortilla chips
F_FI_Price were extremely reasonable and the Food was amazing!  i'm not a big green F_Ingredients fan but i am now!  chunks of P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh green F_Ingredients on the F_FoodItem and boy, were the F_FoodItem plump full of F_FoodItem!  i've decided that i'll never slave over a kitchen stove to prep for a party or get together
Restaurant's catering S_Menu saved me tons of time and headache and it was extremely affordable
i got to enjoy our party and everyone couldn't say enough great things about the Food!
the F_FoodItem are good and the S_Staff are P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
i like that Restaurant are open until 7pm, while most of the F_FoodItem Restaurant S_OpenHours much earlier
the F_FI_Price are kind of steep for what the F_FoodItem are so i marked a O_Exp_StarsByCus down
i had the d
F_FoodItem and the F_Ingredients are good
the F_Ingredients F_FI_Taste fresh!  my husband had the bangers F_FoodItem
it was F_FI_Price
i like that they have the F_FoodItem in individual baggies so the S_OpenHours crowd can just grab and go
also, they sell F_Appetizer and sweet treats
so that's good
i work in central phoenix and have heard good things about the Restaurant
finally got Restaurant for Food with a friend and we both found the S_Menu to have many Food that we would love to try
i decided to have the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
it was Service open faced and seared which is perfect
was seasoned P_F_FI_Taste/deliciously and accompanied by a P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem
we had a P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff, meggie S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/polite enough to write down the name of F_Drinks we F_FI_Taste
i will be back
soon
i give cooperstown a five O_Exp_StarsByCus - based on their F_FI_Price alone
i ate Food with 2 kids and our O_Payment was F_FI_Price with tip
the Food is nothing fancy - just P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and refreshing on a hot day
the girls said their F_FoodItem fingers and mac and F_FoodItem was good and i really P_O_Experience/enjoyed the ty cobb F_FoodItem
also, love the giant glasses of iced F_Drinks
the Service was attentive and quick for being so busy
neat Restaurant to go overall
great F_FoodItem at a very reasonable F_FI_Price!
i used to be scared
i used to be petrified
i was never one to branch out with my variety of cuisine, which meant that i never had indian Food before
until a couple of months ago when i was invited to a dinner party
and at Restaurant
my indian Food cherry was broken
i decided to review this Restaurant now
since i have experienced other Restaurant since
i tend to always come back to this Restaurant
the Restaurant seems very clean, i love the A_Ent_Tvs that they play, and i love the Service
and i think that they have the best Food!  now, i am really bad at names of the Food that i S_Delivery Restaurant (which is why i end up at the Food
i may not know the names, but i know what i like looks like)see me Restaurant at Food real soon :)
i have eaten Restaurant several times only because it it right around the corner from my house
the F_FoodItem was good the first time we ate Restaurant and has been down hill ever since
it F_FI_Taste like the prepackaged F_FoodItem you find at the store and the F_FoodItem are so P_F_FI_Size/small
we S_Delivery a philly F_FoodItem and a california F_FoodItem and all you can F_FI_Taste was the cream F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
totally P_O_Experience/disappointed
mmmm new mexico style mexican Food in arizona! we S_Delivery a number of S_Cutlery and shared to F_FI_Taste a combo of things:  the F_FoodItem & the F_FoodItem were my favorite! F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were just good
our favorite was the F_FoodItem (w red F_Ingredients) and shredded F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
you can't find authentic F_FoodItem anywhere but texas and nm, so what a treat! Restaurant is very generous in their complimentary F_FoodItem w 4 different F_FoodItem when you arrive then sweet F_Dessert for F_Dessert
(they might charge for a 2nd S_Delivery of F_FoodItem though -not sure, never had to S_Delivery more -ask your S_Staff)
only negative i can express would be that they didn't have the soap filled in the men's A_Plc_RestRoom (per my husband ;)
this little hole in the A_Decor packs some big F_FI_Taste
we came to this family-owned italian Restaurant to celebrate our friends' engagement
they are regulars and said we'd love the Food; they were right
we were greeted warmly and informed that the Food would take a bit S_Del_Time due to a large catering S_Delivery that the A_Plc_Kitchen was also cooking
no matter since it didn't seem like much of a delay at all
we P_O_Experience/enjoyed F_FoodItem, dinner F_FoodItem, and conversation before our hibernate F_FoodItem arrived
i had the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and it was a generous helping of three pieces of moist F_FoodItem with a very tasty F_Ingredients and lots of F_FoodItem; i highly P_O_Experience/recommend this Food!  believe it or not, i didn't have any F_FoodItem, but my friend's F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem looked F_FI_Taste
i love little hole-in-the-A_Decor places like Restaurant over a chain Restaurant any day
the Service is friendly and the Food is good
ps-our friends are having buon gusto cater their wedding reception, which means i get more F_FoodItem F_FoodItem S_OpenHours--grazie!
thank god for newer reviews
i should have listened to them!!!been Restaurant a few times before back in like 2003-2004 time frame
remember the Food and O_Experience to be much better back then
was in town visiting and wanted to return to this Restaurant again
yes it was the same old place but the Food was pretty crappy
Service it horrible and these people working Restaurant lack major personality
there was constant confusion as to if we S_Delivery or not, what we S_Delivery, and so forth
the S_Staff was actually a bit P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude i thought constantly rushing us and reaching across me constantly to take S_Cutlery and S_Cutlery from other side of the A_Fur_Table, and at 2 S_Del_Time intervals???will not return
seriously if you are pissed to do this type of work then get a new job
if you run a Restaurant you better be a little personable
i haven't lived in pittsburgh for 4 years, and even now after all this time, on a thursday night i wish i was still lived in oakland so a few friends and i could hit up fuel for some Food and F_Drinks
fuel is the best place in oakland at night, particularly if your over 21
it's a little crowded but the F_Drinks selection (100 different S_Menu) is the best virtually anywhere
the half price S_Menu starts at 11, so you can go Restaurant get dinner and F_Drinks with some friends and it's a good night
the Food is always excellent, and after 11 a good value
the Service is always good
i love the Ambience of the Restaurant, but i could see how people could find it irritating
Restaurant P_A_Env_Type/loud (particularly when Restaurant is live A_Ent_Music) and Restaurant is P_A_Env_Type/crowded
however in my four years going to fuel this never once dissuaded me, because the half priced S_Menu is just too good and trying the new F_Drinks is just too much fun
ahhhh the Restaurant
where do i begin
this Restaurant is a little slice of heaven
the Restaurant is great for a girls get together and anything in between
the F_FoodItem and Food Food are my favorite
i'm always on the lookout for your basic F_FoodItem and 2/3 Restaurant so when i saw la'wan's in a strip shopping center on south tryon, i thought i'd give it a try
the Service was immediate and attentive
they have a Food and a S_Menu from which to order
i chose the Food because i wanted some F_Ingredients
although the Food F_FI_Taste fine, the Food is very limited in S_Menu: F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and a couple of other S_Menu
this would have been ok except that they charged over F_FI_Price for it
if i go back, i should probably choose from the S_Menu
my girlfriend's family was visiting from milwaukee
they wanted to go out for a nice dinner that would be suitable for grandpa and a celiac diet
we decided on the Restaurant
it was the perfect choice
before Food we all had a few of their famous old fashioneds
F_Drinks is their rail F_Drinks so you know they are going to be good
her dad loved the F_FoodItem
it had a F_FoodItem F_Ingredients that he raved about
i had the F_FoodItem which were solid
they came with these F_Ingredients red F_Ingredients F_FoodItem were simple but P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
my gf had the F_FoodItem which she thought were some of the best she's had
the stable's Ambience is quite remarkable
it is basically an old stable fitted with a full A_Plc_Bar and A_Plc_Bar
old wood A_Places, rock A_Decor, a huge barn A_Fur_Door and rickety stairs leading to a second A_Places
a lot of trendy places aim for the kind of Ambience the stable offers but you cant duplicate authenticity
all in all this is a supper club style dining O_Experience in a cool old time setting
if you are looking to try something off the beaten path and are tired of sweet F_Ingredients F_FoodItem, trendy Food, beet F_FoodItem or whatever the latest foodie flavor is this week, the Restaurant at quiveys grove is just right
sows of all ethnicities are welcome at Restaurant!Restaurant is a F_FI_Size mongolian-chinese Food
the Restaurant is never too full, in a great A_LocatedArea, features reasonable F_FI_Price and most of the offerings tempt repeatedly
there are a couple of issues, though
the Service is pedestrian and too carefree; the S_Staff are space cadets and rarely present timely
F_Drinks plenty of fluids
then F_Drinks more
the Food is liberally laced of delicious F_Ingredients
as expected, the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Healthy/old and a F_FI_Healthy risk with every swallow greatly increases
the review reads a little negative, but Restaurant is a sensational guilty pleasure for its F_FI_Price
if you see me at the Food S_Del_OrderingMethod, though
step aside and give respects
i've been Restaurant about 5 times total, and i am completely P_O_Experience/unimpressed
the Food is P_F_FI_Price/overpriced and just not worth it
i have no problem O_Payment for a good Food, but this wasn't a good Food
i could have made what ended up on my S_Cutlery from the contents of my refrigerator and it would have F_FI_Taste better
the one caveat to my "my florist has crappy Food" attitude is the cinnamon scones
these are absolute heaven
too bad i won't be back for them, as getting one means dealing with the P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude S_Staff
out of the five visits, only once was the Service decent, and i think it was only because my dining companion knew the S_Staff
that's bad
i never went in dressed like a bum or Service the S_Staff obnoxiously, but yet the S_Staff had no problem Service me like a second class citizen who didn't belong in the Restaurant
i don't know what kind of qualifications you have to have to get decent Service Restaurant, but i obviously don't have them
i won't be back ever
it's a shame, too, because it is within walking distance
F_FoodItem is pretty darn P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
i prefer Restaurant, but thats my F_FI_Taste
i like the F_FoodItem better at Restaurant, however Restaurant has way better F_Dessert available
funky strip mall like A_LocatedArea but great Food
got some free F_Drinks, i was stoked
great F_Appetizer to share, good for light eaters or to hold over a drunken hunger with out making you sick
just say no to a Food it will not be pretty, stick with firefly for great Restaurant!
best F_FoodItem in the valley!  not only is this in my neighborhood; which makes it great, they have some of the best F_FoodItem around
never too long of a S_Del_Time and always quality Service
competitive F_FI_Price and large S_Menu of F_FoodItem
its nice to go back and get the same F_FoodItem S_Staff each time
we've been dying to visit this place for years! why did we wait for so long??? on countless occasions, we've heard nightmare stories of waiting in line for three hours or more to be seated for dinner
people seem to rave about the authentic and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious italian style F_FoodItem
we had to have a two hour Food break on a weekday
we took a gamble to see if we would be able to be seated within a reasonable amount of time and finally check this place off our list
to our surprise we were seated within 30 minutes and had our Food brought out within 15-20 S_Del_Time
we had the 'F_FoodItem' F_FoodItem and the biancoverde F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem added and it was incredible!!! the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty and F_FoodItem Restaurant reminded us of great F_FoodItem in italy! best F_FoodItem in the phoenix metropolitan area! note Worthiness Food, but probably would not S_Del_Time 3+ S_Del_Time for dinner, but this is a wonderful place for Food--if you have a longer break!note: the website states, "O_Reservation accepted for parties of 6-10 when possible
"
i don't go in enough for the morning S_Staff to know my name, but S_Staff always phrases it as, "i'm sorry, i should know this, what is your name again?" and i find that charming
the homemade whipped Food is almost impossible to resist - and if you're going to do that then you might as well have it be resting upon a large velvet F_Drinks - one of the best F_Drinks F_Drinks in phoenix
i feel like i should bring my powerbook every time i come Restaurant - and i even find myself counting how many non-mac users dare to crack open their cases
still, it's a P_A_Env_Type/fun P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant with P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff and fabulous hot F_Drinks
bring an out of town sf or ny hipster who refuses to believe there is any culture in phoenix
since we didn't hit Restaurant on our last trip to vegas, i made a point to eat Restaurant this time
no tasting S_Menu this time now that my husband and i have lost 120lbs together and are just eating differently
so, we were a tad more conservative, but still splurged and left with our bellies full
we split the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem to start, which was good, but cannot compare to kokomo's (which is now closed to make room for tom's heritage steak boo)
i didn't like the P_F_FI_Size/large pieces of Food on top, which feels like chewing on pieces of grass, but it was tolerable
the F_FoodItem was nice and tender
for dinner we split the F_FoodItem, the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem and the F_FoodItem
this was still so much Food! the F_FoodItem was made with F_Ingredients F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients and was so rich and creamy and really wonderful
i know this is what properly made F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste like and how easy it can be to get it wrong
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were absolute heaven
for F_Dessert we S_Delivery the pumpkin F_Dessert and i was pretty P_O_Experience/disappointed
it was a small circle of mushy F_Ingredients with a F_FoodItem of some kind on top of it
i hate to say it, but F_Dessert factory F_Dessert was better than this stuff
major bummer, thus the deletion of a O_Exp_StarsByCus
when you O_Payment F_FI_Price for F_Dessert at a Restaurant like this, you want to shove your face it in and eat 15 of them, not just pick at it and wish it were more like at a Restaurant where you hate their Food
mediocre at best
went Restaurant since it was in ny/ny and we were staying Restaurant
hungry and in the mood for Food we went in
Service was good, the F_FoodItem was awesome
F_FoodItem F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Quality/dry, and without much F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem was pretty good but again not much flavor
keep in mind we had just arrived in vegas and were hungry and tired and excited and didn't have any F_Drinks in our system
to me this is the time i would eat and enjoy just about Food!!
it was still mediocre at best
wouldn't P_O_Experience/recommend it and definitely not going to eat Restaurant again
nice Food good Food and Service they even have a little Food Food i also like Food Restaurant too all around a good place to eat!
always P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Restaurant and great S_Staff! we P_O_Experience/enjoyed another wonderful dinner Restaurant just last night
this place was sooo close to getting 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus
however, one thing changed my mind
i had a O_Reservation in the Food hours, and i was on time and on my O_Reservation notes, i proposed a A_Fur_Table
it wasn't ready when i got Restaurant so we had to take a timer and stand around
30 S_Del_Time later we got the A_Fur_Table, and it was facing A_OutsideView which was a good A_OutsideView
this is the only reason it didn't get 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus
the A_Fur_Table took way to long to get and even when i put it for in advance
the S_Staff was nice and P_S_Stf_Experience/quick, and explained the S_Menu just right
the Food was amazing! i love Food Food and decided to go with F_FoodItem, and it was hot and fresh F_FI_Taste
it wasn't a P_A_Env_Type/loud Restaurant and was very clean
i wil love to come back to try something else on the S_Menu
it's taken me forever to get to Restaurant, a Restaurant i've been wanting to try for years! i went Restaurant this past weekend and was so happy to finally head to this beautiful Restaurant that has a breezy island vibe with sprawling A_Plc_Patio both at the front of the house and back
it's no wonder the spot was bustling when i went for Food at 9 p
on a friday night -- the mixed crowd of all ages packed the house, which had cozy A_Fur_Table and striking printed A_Decor that make guests feel right at home, no matter the crowd
the A_Plc_Bar contained a few A_Ent_Tv with A_Entertainment events on, so you could Restaurant in any type of Ambience you wanted -- cozy dining A_Plc_DiningRoom, spacious A_Plc_Patio or at the A_Plc_Bar
our S_Staff were P_S_Stf_Appearance/professional and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive, and the Food was P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic and hugely portioned -- i took half of mine home
i loved the lucy's "spiked" F_Drinks (F_FI_Price) F_FoodItem i got, with F_Drinks, F_Drinks and fresh F_Ingredients
it was refreshing and strong and didn't have a gross F_Drinks F_FI_Taste -- it was easy to F_Drinks and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
we started with the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem (F_FI_Price), which is pretty much a must-try since all the F_Ingredients, including the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, are all made in-house
the F_FoodItem had the perfect amount of P_F_FI_Taste/spiciness (maybe a 7 out of 10), and the F_FoodItem would have been great to eat on its own
for my Food, i tried the shangri-la vegetarian F_FoodItem (F_FI_Price), which consisted of F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients
i usually don't get F_FoodItem, but i did this time, and they had really great seasoning and the perfect amount of F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, but the consistency made it difficult to hold together
not that it matters -- it was a great veggie F_FoodItem that was really filling
Restaurant's biggest impression on me was the Service of the S_Staff, who made you feel welcome and valued from start to finish
it's no wonder people remain so loyal to the Restaurant -- it seems like a wonderful place for anyone to have a great Food
this review is just specific to their Food S_Menu and Food Service
i took my mom to Food after a busy morning of shopping at the mall
we were greeted right away and asked which we would prefer, a A_Fur_Table or a A_Fur_Table
i love when Restaurant give you a choice if either are available
our S_Staff was very sweet, P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledgeable about the S_Menu
mom and i both had F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was so P_F_FI_Taste/yummy! i almost ate it all and F_FoodItem was a good size! the only downside to the Food was that they charged me 3
25 for an unsweetened F_Drinks
what??! i should have ordered their house F_Ingredients for a few bucks more
oh well
everything else was wonderful and i'll certainly return for Food again soon
so i have been a customer at Restaurant from literally day one
i have been through the change in ownership and i have to say that the current S_Staff, S_Staff, is so P_S_Stf_Behavior/terrific!  S_Staff comes over and chats with us and is always so awesome and down to earth!  the Food is even better lately (if that's possible) and they always go the extra mile to make your dining O_Experience terrific
i'm not someone who has been to this Restaurant one time and is reviewing it
i am not a paid spokesperson!  just a very P_O_Experience/satisfied customer
this is a hidden gem in las vegas
the A_Plc_Bar is right in the middle of the A_Entertainment at palace station
i was expecting an actual Restaurant, not a A_Plc_Bar with 20 A_Furniture
Restaurant was a long line to S_Del_Time to sit down so i figured it was definitely worth the wait
luckily, i was with other people so i played roulette while we waited to be A_Fur_Table
once A_Fur_Table, they take your S_Delivery very calmly
S_Staff do not P_S_Stf_Behavior/rush you considering there is a line of people waiting to eat
the Food is cooked in steam pots instead of a gas burner
i ordered the F_FoodItem and the pan roast at level 7 hot
this Restaurant is soo good i would P_O_Experience/recommend it to anyone
margherita doc F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, some of the best i've had, and we had great Service!!! our S_Staff S_Staff was fantastic and very P_S_Stf_Experience/informative
great first time O_Experience :)
you get a lot of Food
but F_FI_Quality is poor and F_FI_Price are high
this Restaurant is P_O_Exp_StarsByCus/overrated and F_FI_Price too high!!!
my favorite mexican Restaurant in town
i think Restaurant has better Food in general, but i prefer Restaurant
the F_FoodItem are just as good and it is easier to get to and always easy to get a A_Fur_Table; and the F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic! the S_Staff is very P_S_Stf_Behavior/welcoming, making it easy to P_O_Experience/come_back regularly
if you S_Delivery one of the Food, get an extra F_FoodItem a la carte
they are too good to come in Restaurant and not have at least one
very P_O_Experience/disappointing is an understatement! good china boasts on their website that they were the 2007 recipients of new york's top 100 chinese/asian fusion award, and all i can say is that may have been so in 2007
however, good china fails to live up to that reputation, today, 7-years later
my family has recently moved back to the united states from living in singapore for the last 4-years, and we are originally from new york
so, we have a little knowledge in authentic chinese Food and americanized new york chinese Food--and this eating O_Experience really fell short
starting with the F_Appetizer, we had "spring F_FoodItem", and for those of you new yorkers, most Restaurant have P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful "F_FoodItem F_FoodItem" that are stuffed with a combination of F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem sprouts, and F_Ingredients
what we received were F_Ingredients saturated "spring F_FoodItem"
because they were so oily, each F_Appetizer oozed F_Ingredients, canceling out any flavors from the F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients used
we could have literally squeezed out enough F_Ingredients to reuse
we also S_Delivery the "F_FoodItem", which many F_Ingredients Restaurant, including many in singapore call "F_FoodItem"--a type of dim sum
there was very little filling used inside the wrappers, and it seemed that someone might have been heavy handed with F_Ingredients, because they were incredibly sweet instead of savory
you could not even F_FI_Taste any F_FoodItem (and they may have used imitation F_FoodItem from the looks of it), nor could you F_FI_Taste the cream F_FoodItem since it had been turned into a F_Dessert cream due to the over use of something sweet as a flavoring
what can i say about the "war wonton F_Appetizer"? the proper name for this F_Appetizer is "wor wonton F_Appetizer", but what we had was "slime F_Appetizer"
the wontons had been so over F_FI_CookingLevel that F_FoodItem P_F_FI_CookingLevel/melted off the filling, producing an off-putting P_F_FI_Size/slimy Food
however, the F_FoodItem was okay--a bit on the salty side
next, the hibernate Food we tried
we S_Delivery "F_FoodItem"
obviously, they use fettuccini F_FoodItem instead of authentic F_Ingredients F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, this too was on the P_F_FI_Healthy/salty side and the F_FoodItem was over F_FI_CookingLevel--not at all tender
we also had "F_FoodItem" (F_FoodItem), which were flat and F_FoodItem-like in texture--nothing like F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem foo young is, simply put, an F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
well, that is what it is in F_Ingredients Restaurant in new york and singapore
how can you mess up an F_FoodItem F_FoodItem? oh, you can make it the consistency of F_FoodItem! the F_Ingredients they use on top of it seems to be the same brown salty F_Ingredients used on other Food we had like the "F_FoodItem F_FoodItem"
"F_FoodItem F_FoodItem", in every place we have ever eaten it, is usually a light garlicky F_Ingredients--not a brown salty F_Ingredients with no hint of F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste
the "sesame F_FoodItem", we are still not sure if there was actually F_FoodItem inside the heavily F_Ingredients nuggets--the F_FoodItem was hard and over F_FI_CookingLevel
it also F_FI_Taste like someone had poured a whole bottle of honey over the nuggets--no F_Ingredients in sight
in addition, if it could not get worse, when you looked in the container of this supposed "sesame F_FoodItem", it seems they spooned in all the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/burnt residual F_Ingredients F_FoodItem that sits within the oil used for frying--meaning they are not periodically cleaning and changing the oil between orders--gross!on the plus side, the "house P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem" was descent, portion F_FI_Size was good, and the Ambience looked clean
overall, even though the F_FI_Price are average, you are overpaying for poor F_FI_Quality Food
a few years ago, i would have given this Restaurant a 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus review but it has gone downhill since then
they used to give Offers if you only got a few things in your F_FoodItem
they have continually raised F_FI_Price while giving P_F_FI_Size/smaller F_FoodItem
i'm pretty sure they use smaller spoons
and i get that they are a corporation and that the decisions aren't always up to them, but there is no denying the value has gone down hill
it's still good Food, but not worth F_FI_Price a person
very nice! Restaurant is one of the few true Food delis in town, and they have a good assortment of what people from back east are used finding
yes, there are plenty of popular favorites that we all know: F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, etc
, and there are also some F_FI_Religious Food Food you might not be familiar with
i have an "old world" Food heritage thanks to my mom
every st
joseph's day, S_Staff made F_FoodItem, and every easter S_Staff made a F_FoodItem
when i first found Restaurant i was floored! F_FoodItem readily available! F_FoodItem in the deli case! checkerboard F_Appetizer by the dozen! P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen F_FoodItem to take home and bake!if you've been looking for Food like nonna used to make, or you're feeling a little adventurous, or you just want some good F_FoodItem by the slice, head to the university district and give Restaurant a try
check your S_Delivery before leaving!!! i'm not one to complain or even care much when my S_Delivery is messed up; as i work in the Food industry, and understand that shot happens
but it's happened more than 3 times now, at around 12 am- (not a busy time) just make sure you get what your O_Payment for, it's not fun to get home and not have someone's Food
a F_FoodItem bar has to earn my respect
first pass is a quick look-through of the F_FoodItem in the display
i try to be unobtrusive about it so i don't look like a tourist, but if it's stacked up and already cut, or if i see a P_F_FI_Size/big F_FoodItem, or a F_FI_CookingLevel on the back counter, i'll just flee, or i'll S_Delivery california F_FoodItem
second pass is to throw down the gauntlet to the F_FoodItem S_Staff
a triple-whammy S_Delivery of F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem and yellowtail F_FoodItem
typically this S_Delivery will F_FI_Price between F_FI_Price and F_FI_Price, so it had better be the goddam best the S_Staff has to offer
kojisan did not dissapoint
either later in my first visit or on my second when we had dropped the pretense, he stuck out his chest and beat it with a quick head nod to say he took pride in vanquishing my challenge with ease
it was at least as good as the finest F_FoodItem i've ever had in the valley (cut and Service by F_FoodItem on shea's king of the valley, "fred"-san)
now, i have spent the last 10 years at ayako, and over those years, i developed a scale of F_FoodItem that is "worth eating"
at the lowest level there is "good", then "very good", then "excellent"
and at the very top is "life changing"
ayako was always very good, usually excellent, and sometimes if you're lucky, life changing
hana is always excellent and very often is life changing
now i realize this seems to be a lot of hoopla about a piece of F_FoodItem, right? i mean, come on
but if you're a serious sushicon (connoisseur), you know what i'm talking about
yeah, i know some supersnob sushicons won't look at it unless if's alive just before you eat it
yeah, that's pretty much a life-changing O_Experience every time, but hey, this is phoenix, for god's sake
the third pass is the whole, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/deep-fried F_FoodItem (sweet F_FoodItem)
this is a test of their F_FoodItem F_Ingredients, knowledge of just the right F_FI_Size of F_FoodItem, how to prepare it (which pieces of the shell to remove), and of the simplicity in preparation
the resulting presentation can seem scary to the unwashed
two big eyes are staring up at you, tentacles sticking F_FoodItem F_FoodItem way, now P_F_FI_Taste/crispy and P_F_FI_Taste/yummy, and my final squeeze of F_Ingredients completes it
the "brains" are the best part
the fourth pass is if they know how to make a proper tamago (cold F_FoodItem, crepe-like thing)
it's fluffy like F_FoodItem, and it has seemingly thousands of layers upon layers, folded over and over like the finest katana
once again, kojisan presented some of the finest F_FoodItem i have ever F_FI_Taste
the fifth and final pass is the hardest to fulfill
natto is fermented soybean, which when potent smells like the nastiest stinky socks you've ever experienced
most american F_FoodItem bars won't serve it because it's just too offensive to nearby Food
those that do S_Staff a toned-down mild version that is like a strong F_FoodItem
natto is best Service stirred with soy F_Ingredients and topped with the F_FoodItem of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, sprinkled with finely cut dried F_Ingredients
as you are ready to eat Food, dump it over a piping hot bowl of F_FoodItem and devour
wanna guess if hana serves it?the Service at hana is edgy
Service uniform is hip, and like most F_FoodItem bars, the S_Staff freely yell at one another across the dining A_Plc_DiningRoom
although kojisan keeps the A_Env_AC on in winter to flush out loiterers, and even though multiple busers swoop down after your last bite to clear your empty S_Cutlery, you'll have to S_Del_Time 45 to 70 S_Del_Time at prime-time on prime S_OpenHours to be A_Fur_Table
this can be awkward in the small corner of the front part of the Restaurant without glaring at other A_Fur_Table customers, willing them to get the heck out of your A_Fur_Table so you can sit down
arrive before 6:40 or after 9:10 if you loathe the S_Del_Time
please don't try this Restaurant
and please don't tell other people about it
there's just not enough A_Places for us all
lol
enjoy
this place is a favorite of mine in oakland
great F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients F_FoodItem! there are a variety of other choices as well but i usually go Restaurant for the F_FoodItem
if you work or go to school in oakland, it's a nice little place to grab Food
but there is one caveat - if you arrive during the Food rush, you may have trouble finding a A_Fur_Table and the S_Del_Time may be a bit long
this can be problematic if you need to get back to work in a timely fashion
otherwise this place is a favorite of mine
ah, my F_FoodItem has just arrived and my P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem is on the way
time to enjoy! i encourage you to do the same
requested the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem vegetarian and got a F_FoodItem S_Cutlery
then not checked on for 10 S_Del_Time and then had to S_Del_Time for a new S_Delivery
f this place
if given the choice of any other Restaurant
you should choose another Restaurant
i S_Del_Time almost an S_Del_Time for some F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
i could have drove home and made some kraft in a box for how long this isht took
when i first moved to arizona, i wanted to try new establishments i couldn't find back east
my friend who lives in south scottsdale brought me here, and i'm italian, so i was excited
for being named "F_Ingredients" its F_Ingredients wasn't too great
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
it was ok but nothing to rave about
i wouldn't recommend it, and i havent been back, but for Food and good F_Ingredients, i would prob go somewhere else
the F_FoodItem was good and the F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Size/large
went with number 92
beautiful F_FI_Religious A_Ent_Music and interesting F_FI_Religious icons give it a touch of the exotic
Service a bit slow and S_Staff never P_S_Stf_Behavior/smiled, but P_S_Stf_Behavior/acceptable
lots of other options in the area - would try something else next time
we stopped by the Restaurant at treasure for Food before going to the cirque de soleil show
i'd never been to a A_Entertainment dinner Food before so i didn't really know what to expect F_FI_Quality-wise
i walked around & first got a S_Cutlery of their "american F_FoodItem" Food
they seemed very bland so i decided to try again
meh, not much better the second time with the F_FoodItem & other P_F_FI_Size/small Food
i saw a lot of people at the F_FoodItem line so i figured i'd give it a shot
this time, i was P_O_Experience/satisfied
i got the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem tossed with F_FoodItem in an alfredo / F_FoodItem-based F_Ingredients
F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
i wish i wouldn't found this first because i probably would've just gotten two helpings of F_FoodItem! the F_Dessert were also pretty good
there was a large variety and i tried out a few different Food that i P_O_Experience/enjoyed
one of the highlights was the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_Appetizer
would we stop again? with as much as las vegas has to offer, probably not, but it's definitely a convenient/decent option if you're at the Restaurant anyways
i have been coming to this A_LocatedArea for at least 6 years
the F_FI_Quality of the Food has gone down quite a lot this past year
it used to be our family's favorite place to dine and have prime F_FoodItem
we brought some friends over for dinner last month and was very P_O_Experience/disappointed
also, they didn't F_FI_CookingLevel the F_FoodItem as we wanted
when we complained they only offered to put it back on the grill
no apologies
Service was mediocre and the F_FI_Quality of the meet is not as good as it used to be
i am sad as i had hoped that things would be as they used to be
a F_FI_Quality dining Restaurant
i won't be back
horrible! awful Service, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/burned Food, P_A_Env_Type/dirty Restaurant and F_FI_CookingLevel, ants on the A_Fur_Table, limited A_Fur_Table, the list could go on and on
the "Food deal" includes fries and a F_Drinks which is a can of safeway brand F_Drinks
stay away! i will never go back to this Restaurant
if you want to overpay for Food from a what looks like a dirty crack house, this is your place!
mac n F_FoodItem squared!  that's all i have to say
everyone else was trying to be healthy by eating a F_FoodItem Food and F_FoodItem or F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem, but c'mon when in a new place you have to try the signature dishes
the mac and F_FoodItem squared didn't look even close to what you might get out of a kraft box
instead it is a white gooey F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (not elbows) with F_FoodItem, bacon (P_F_FI_Size/big F_FoodItem), and a F_FoodItem (?)
absolutely P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
but wait, one of the most important things
the A_Decor
you walk in and to your left is an enclosed A_Places full of kegs
you can see in via the glass and A_OutsideView the lines running from the kegs up to the ceiling
then you see huge chrome pipes running across the ceiling through the foyer into the Restaurant and across to the center A_Plc_Bar
to add perspective we are taking about a hundred F_Drinks
dafe
i honestly think it's cheap, convenient and the Food is great (obviously, you wanna to go right when they open since it's fresh) i think for the theme and F_FI_Price it's totally worth it, plus for F_FoodItem in arizona is not bad! the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
i would rather eat Restaurant 100000000000 more than ra or stingray F_FoodItem
we've been Restaurant a few more times and they do O_Payment attention to the F_Ingredients levels when we discuss with the S_Delivery taker
if you make O_Reservation, they set the A_Fur_Table up and take you in right away
much better to eat this way
although we have S_Delivery mild spiciness levels the last few times, i think i am going to give them a shot again next time and S_Delivery the medium spiciness level
i think their Food probably F_FI_Taste best with spiciness at the medium level
i like their F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem better than the tandoori F_FoodItem
i have been to blt F_FoodItem multiple times and every time it is amazing! the F_FoodItem are great and Service anyway you want them i am a med rare man and the last few times i have been Restaurant it has been 100% on! the S_Staff is fP_S_Stf_Behavior/riendly and able to seat you super quick
the quotes on the backs of S_Staff shirts are not only funny but keep you entertained when you S_Del_Time on your Food to come
and the F_Drinks are the best around having the choice between spiked and not spiked F_Drinks is nice treat
(try the twinkie F_Drinks) the A_Plc_Kitchen is open so you see the S_Staff and the grill so you know your Food is F_FI_CookingLevel in a clean A_Environment
all in all the O_Experience is nice and they are open late like a great vegas strip eatery should be!!!! thank you blt and see you next time i am in vegas
the house F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem alone are Worthiness a visit
my favorite Food on the S_Menu are the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, the fresca F_FoodItem with gorgonzola honey dressing, the sorrento F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem and pink alfredo F_Ingredients, and the amatriciana F_FoodItem (just a touch P_F_FI_Taste/spicy)
great date-night Ambience inside, and the A_Plc_Patio area offers a casual option too
i stopped in Restaurant on impulse en route to hobby lobby and upon seeing it was 5:30 i realized i was in time for the early bird Offers for $8
99
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem with two sides
this time i was aware in advance that when they ask you if you want F_Ingredients it F_FI_Price extra even though they don't tell you about it
the green F_FoodItem were probably saltier than is F_FI_Healthy and F_FI_CookingLevel in the "mushy" style, which i like fine, and had lots of good bacon pieces and flavor
the caesar F_FoodItem couldn't have been much better, cold, P_F_FI_Taste/crisp and crunchy with just the right amount of good dressing
the F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Taste/delicious but awfully sweet to blend with the Food, more like a F_Dessert unto themselves, especially with the cinnamon F_Ingredients
i was P_O_Experience/impressed with the F_FoodItem which was so P_F_FI_Size/thick F_FoodItem was almost an ovoid
it was F_FI_CookingLevel more rare than medium rare but i like that fine, too
the impressive part was how nicely the S_Cutlery cut through it and how easy it was to chew
i've gotten F_FoodItem twice in the last few months from outback for a couple dollars more that were so tough you couldn't stab it with a fork, had to be a lumberjack to saw through it and it chewed like your grandmother's old shoe leather
it was a real Service to eat this one and have it be the way a good F_FoodItem should be
i would P_O_Experience/come_back easily, and hope i will sometime
my only objection is that they constantly try to upsell you to F_Drinks, F_Appetizer, F_Ingredients, etc
the S_Staff was very nice and P_S_Stf_Behavior/efficient, i just don't want the times i have to say no, thank you to outnumber the times i say yes, please
it sets a tone of negativity in its own way
a nice and affordable spot for a filling Food
i S_Delivery two F_FoodItem, toast, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_Drinks for under F_FI_Price
my Food arrived almost immediately and F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
my S_Staff was also very sweet and P_S_Stf_Availability/attentive
i will definitely make this a regular spot of mine
first, i must disclose that being married to a peruvian who is most demanding about about anything culinary and, particularly peruvian Food, i have come to be somewhat more demanding myself
that being said, i would P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant even though i gave it only three O_Exp_StarsByCus
we sampled the chicha morada, a non-alcoholic F_Drinks made from purple F_Ingredients with some F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients added, and were comforted to find that it was fresh made (as opposed to mixed from powder)
the papa a la huancaína (F_Ingredients in a huancayo style), a peruvian staple presented in regional variations, was a good F_Appetizer, its fresh F_Ingredients noticeably tasty
for my own personal F_FI_Taste i would have preferred a touch of spiciness, but hey, this would not be a valid reason to down O_Exp_StarsByCus it
the F_FoodItem (F_Ingredients with a F_FoodItem filling) did not fare as well, the filling F_FI_Taste a little on the greasy side
the seco de cordero, a sort of F_Ingredients F_Ingredients with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, came in a very generous A_Places and did not P_O_Experience/disappoint
again, the fresh F_Ingredients carried the day!unfortunately, we were to full to F_FI_Taste F_Dessert, a project for another day
the Service was very good, even my picky spouse agreed that it is a Restaurant Worthiness of a return visit
i have lived in the area for years and always passed this place wondering what it was
finally, my husband and i decided to give it a try
we had no idea what to expect
the Restaurant is very intimate
some of the A_Fur_Table are long with benched A_Fur_Table so yes there is a possibility you may sit next to strangers
but who cares when the Food is as P_F_FI_Taste/yummy as it is!!!  the S_Menu pretty basic but has many options for a pasties
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem it was amazing!  my husband got the pesto F_FoodItem he raved about how P_F_FI_Taste/delicious it was (didn't try because i do not like pesto)
we ended with F_Dessert some F_FoodItem caramel F_Ingredients with F_Ingredients cream it was to die for!
blue F_Drinks loves the ladies!!
and we love you too! Offers 4-7pm dailyhalf-off F_Drinks and F_Appetizer
came with a friend and his girlfriend on their recommendation about 2 weeks ago for ayce cuz they said it was the best in town
we all S_Delivery the all you can eat and began indulging in skewers, F_FoodItem, nigiri and just about everything
the Food was just okay to me and on numerous occasions our S_Staff forgot a few of our Food
for the same F_FI_Price for ayce i would rather go to sumo sushi 2, and it's much closer to my house
the friends i went with who were raving about this Restaurant before we got Restaurant had even said the Food wasn't as good this S_Del_Time around
A_Environment is cool, young and trendy with some good A_Ent_Music playing
not cool enough to get me to P_O_Experience/go_back for ayce though
would only P_O_Experience/go_back if i was invited by friends again
nobody in vegas can dethrone sumo sushi 2 for "best ayce in vegas" in my honest opinion!
worst pf changs i have ever been to
sat down and the F_Ingredients were all over the S_Cutlery (dirty), then when the F_Appetizer comes out my bowl was not clean, and lastly as my mother was eating our lo mein she pulled out a F_FI_Size of paper!! gross!! at least the S_Staff was nice enough to comp our Food, but at the same time insinuated we had put the F_FI_Size of paper Restaurant??? who knows
just don't go Restaurant!!!
had been wanting to try the outsider for awhile (saw they could do gluten free) and after soaking up some culture after day 2 at the museum, i had the chance
the blackboard Offers looked promising and the F_FI_Price did too with many Food F_FI_Price between £6
80 and £8
00 at S_OpenHours
i had hoped to get a A_Fur_Table with a A_OutsideView over to the castle as i had my mum visiting but we had a A_Fur_Table at the front which turned out to be fab! the A_Furniture A_Fur_Table are uber comfortable with masses of pillows
i had the mussels in a cream F_Ingredients with F_FoodItem, bacon and F_FoodItem and for a nice change they came with F_FoodItem instead of F_FoodItem
my mum (it was girly jubilee weekend) had the F_FoodItem belly in a red F_Drinks F_FoodItem with sweet F_Ingredients and S_Staff said it was fabulous (i didn't try as i'm gluten free and wasn't sure it was safe)
both were P_F_FI_Size/huge F_FoodItem and we both loved our Food
Restaurant were tons of mussels (only a couple S_OpenHours) and the pail of F_FoodItem seemed endless but fab with just the right amount of crispiness and some garlicky F_Ingredients seasoning
the S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Availability/busy - S_Staff were P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and seemed to cope
i would definitely return for dinner as the Food is fab and F_Drinks are reasonable (£4 a glass if F_Drinks, £2
50 for F_Drinks) but this is a great place for a post museum Food!
terrible!!!!!!! went Restaurant on my birthday S_OpenHours only cuz we we're staying at the imperial palace! wish i'd have read the reviews ahead of time
spent F_FI_Price on an P_F_FI_Quality/old country Food ripoff!! terrible A_Decor, uncomfortable A_Fur_Table, poor F_FI_Quality Food! don't go!!!!!
a great selection of P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and seasonal Food
Restaurant's pretty much something for everyone Restaurant
Service was very good
i was a little confused by their S_Menu, but the S_Staff explained it to me
i was quite pleased with the Food
much better than expected for the A_LocatedArea (in a strip center)
this is a mediocre F_FoodItem place
edible, but not great
i won't throw a hissy-fit going Restaurant, but i wouldn't go out of my way to find this Restaurant
amazing!this P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant in montreal had the most A_Env_Type S_Staff and extremely well F_FI_CookingLevel Food
i highly P_O_Experience/recommend the F_FoodItem bar
you can select an assortment of F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, clams, octopus, choosing just a few or a bit of everything
the S_Staff F_FI_CookingLevel each perfectly then brings out several F_Ingredients to complement your options
i have to say, the flavor was so good i didn't add much in the way of F_Ingredients
i also didn't add any F_Ingredients, which for me is unheard of
(i went with my mother who is not a fan of P_F_FI_Healthy/salty Food and S_Staff said it was perfectly F_FI_CookingLevel too, so i promise it's not too salty
)the S_Staff added fresh lemon zest, and was generous in pouring the F_Drinks
not to mention the entire S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly, P_S_Stf_Behavior/entertaining, P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive, and P_S_Stf_Behavior/welcoming
i can't wait to go back!
i've never reviewed a Restaurant before, but i really wanted to share my appreciation for this Restaurant
it is my favourite Restaurant in waterloo and the Food is normally P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic
on my most recent visit, one Food was slightly less superlative than usual, and when i commented on this to the S_Staff the S_Staff not only came to apologize but also gave me a voucher worth significantly more than i O_Payment for my Food in the first place
this is the best Service i have ever experienced, and in combination with the pleasant, sophisticated Ambience and wonderful Food i would have no hesitation in unreservedly P_O_Experience/recommending the bauer kitchen
what can i say about this Restaurant that hasn't been said before? an amazing hidden culinary treasure, this quaint Restaurant will have you P_O_Experience/coming_back for more
family owned and french Food inspired, this Restaurant has some of the best F_FoodItem, F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem i have had in las vegas
i first visited this Restaurant for a relaxed Food with my girlfriend while driving around town
and boy am i glad i did! walking into this Restaurant you are immediately P_S_Stf_Behavior/greeted with a warm O_Experience by the S_Staff and by the sight of delicious F_Dessert and Service
from F_Drinks to F_FoodItem to creamy and tasty F_Appetizer, this Restaurant has something for everyone
we started off with a F_FoodItem and a S_Cutlery of F_FoodItem F_Appetizer, both of them amazingly good
by the flavor of our Food we could tell everything is made fresh that day (so the later you make it Restaurant, the slightly more limited your S_Menu might be) and prepared to S_Delivery! please make sure to arrive hungry so you can try the peach or the pear F_FoodItem
you will love them
note: this Restaurant is a bit difficult to find so refer to the yelp profile picture which has the accurate A_LocatedArea on it
lastly, please beware they S_OpenHours at 4pm, so this is a Food and Food spot
so many people talk about the competitors around sin city, but most of them cannot even compare
the Service was endearing and the Food is F_FI_Taste
i also appreciate the fact that when the uni was not up to standards they warned us, gave us a F_FI_Taste, and did not hold it against us when we did not like it either
for starters; F_FoodItem, soft shell F_FoodItem, and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/baked green F_FoodItem are the way to go
as for F_FoodItem, many of them come heavily F_Ingredients
i am not the biggest fan of that, but the one's without kind of fell flat
they need to meet somewhere in the middle
the ugly was tasty, but three different A_Decor and the amount was overkill
the sapporo crunch F_FoodItem was one that stuck out because of all the different kind of F_FoodItem
the generous P_F_FI_Size/amounts of F_Ingredients and less F_FoodItem was much appreciated
their hirame does not come with a ponzu or Food, so i could tell that it was fresh
now a days, i have turned into a senior citizen and eat dinner around 5
it was nice to meet some of my yelpie friends Restaurant for a late dinner
even though i did not eat as much as i would if we had met earlier, i still left feeling full without feeling like dying
we sat until almost S_OpenHours and no one rushed us out
the Restaurant looks like it is ran by a family and they definitely Service their guests well
i would make this a regular haunt
first things first, Food/F_Drinks was phenomenal (pretzels w/ multiple F_Ingredients S_Menu, F_FoodItem pot pie is out of control - ask for some tabasco to take it to the next level)one problem - i was not sure for half the S_OpenHours if it was a gay A_Plc_Bar?? - the S_Staff (all dudes with schmedium t-shirts and the same crew cut) -- this is las vegas, not the castro, get with it and hire a few knockouts to get behind that A_Plc_Bar and do you proud
my boyfriend P_O_Experience/surprised me with two nights at tsr for our anniversary
i have reviews of our O_Experience of the Restaurant and the spa but wanted to write a separate review for  our O_Experience at orange sky
as my other reviews stated, Service at this Restaurant overall is a bit mixed, maybe 2
5 O_Exp_StarsByCus at best
when we checked in at the desk on the A_Entertainment A_Places before going up to the Restaurant, the man at the desk asked for our name and asked what S_Del_Time our O_Reservation were for
we gave him the information and he asked again what our name was
i could clearly see were next on his list of names
we repeated it and then he just said 'ok', and another man walked over and hit the button to the elevator
no smiles from either, no 'have a nice dinner'
neither one of them said anything more to us and it almost felt like we were interrupting their conversation
upon arriving on the 15th A_Places, the hostest informed us that our A_Fur_Table would be about 10 S_Del_Time even though we were right on time
no big deal, we just took a A_Fur_Table in the A_Places and S_Del_Time to get a F_Drinks
our pre-dinner F_FoodItem were okay but the Service was slow and without a smile
what are these S_Staff so crabby about? in addition, rather than take our S_Delivery after having the S_Menu's for 5 S_Del_Time, our S_Staff S_Del_Time at the A_Plc_Bar for what seemed like forever for 4 glasses of F_Drinks to be filled for another A_Fur_Table and chatted with the other S_Staff
luckily once we S_Delivery our F_Drinks, they S_Delivery fairly P_S_Del_Time/quickly and we were able to have one F_Drinks before our A_Fur_Table was ready
shortly thereafter, we were summoned to go with a hostest to our A_Fur_Table
we were lead through dancing couples on the dance A_Places and were sat in the second A_Fur_Table from the front
the hostest never offered to pull out our A_Fur_Table so it made it a bit awkward to get into but it was cozy once you sat down with all the pillows
we did have a nice dinner and the way the A_Fur_Table are positioned, it makes it feel very private
that is unless you have a noisy group next to you on the other side of the divider
ours weren't overly noisy but you could clearly hear everything they were saying while we were busy eating
our S_Staff was more P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly after striking up a conversation and all the Food was good
i had the sweet F_Ingredients F_Appetizer with the filet and the bf S_Delivery a F_FoodItem with the ribeye
not anything particularly memorable but it was good
we were given a F_Dessert for our anniversary but can't say whether it was free or not since i didn't O_Payment the O_Payment :) it was good, some sort of Food F_FoodItem with hazelnuts with some very pretty penmanship wishing us happy anniversary
it was the best Service related touch we had received the whole evening
we missed the sunset during dinner which i'm sure would have added to the O_Experience but watching highway traffic whiz by on the 101 after dark isn't overly romantic in my opinion
even if Restaurant are mountains in the A_OutsideView
overall though, given the mediocer Service at the front, the standard F_FoodItem affair on the S_Menu and lack of atmosphere past dark, i can't say that i would go back
if you do decide to go anyway, make sure you go early enough to catch the sunset!
P_F_FI_Price/cheapest mexican Food in town!!!  great Food and ok Service
the one on gibson is the best in my book
horrible customer Service
(from "Food, drive-ins and dives" to "Restaurant impossible!") i understand slow/busy A_Plc_Bar Service - but this was straight up rudeness and we were ignored for over 20 S_Del_Time
we walked in (just two of us) in front of a group of four or so people
the group that came in behind us sat behind us as well, and they had their Food before we even were acknowledged and got a glass of F_Drinks
we tried asking the male S_Staff for F_Drinks and S_Staff continued past us (ignored us!) and P_S_Stf_Behavior/helped the A_Fur_Table behind us, taking their S_Delivery, bringing them several S_Cutlery of Food
the S_Staff then told us that the other S_Staff would P_S_Stf_Behavior/help us
we were continued to be ignored
i felt bad that it was the S_Staff' first day, but the other S_Staff was of no assistance to S_Staff (or us), which made the entire Ambience look bad
he kept walking past our A_Fur_Table to S_Staff and check on the group that came behind us
it took 20 S_Del_Time for a glass of F_Drinks and an additional 5 to get my F_Drinks
we S_Del_Time over a S_Del_Time hour for the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (an F_Appetizer) and about 50 S_Del_Time for a "wee" F_FI_Size F_FoodItem
meanwhile the group that came in behind us has had a "not so wee" F_FI_Size F_FoodItem (F_FI_Size), a couple S_Delivery or F_FoodItem, etc
and the S_Staff kept bringing out S_Cutlery for them while we sat with one glass of F_Drinks
the group of people behind us finished and O_Payment for their Food as our fricking F_Appetizer was coming out
the only reason we didn't just walk away is human courtesy to the poor S_Staff on S_Staff first day
looks like this Restaurant needs to be on Food network again for the A_Entertainment "Restaurant impossible!" because the male S_Staff was a complete ass - either that or he was racist and ignored my boyfriend
i literally saw him make eye contact as we asked for help and he kept it moving to the group just past us
that came in after us!i will never come back, and i will never tell my out of town guests to come Restaurant
i was a tad P_O_Experience/disappointed by this place considering all the hype i heard about it
the S_Staff was wonderful, very P_S_Stf_Appearance/pleasant and P_S_Stf_Experience/efficient
the Food was good and if with a group, i would P_O_Experience/go_back without whining
but it was pretty ordinary
my F_FoodItem was a tad P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked but still had good F_FI_Taste
the F_FoodItem were the same, nothing to write home about
my F_Drinks entitled black and white was really white, i think the waved the Food syrup bottle over the glass
a little P_F_FI_Price/overpriced for my O_Experience
the Food was good
atmosphere is lacking
not many options to choose from
i probably will not P_O_Experience/go_back
great O_Experience
P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot Food which is increasing rare to be Service these S_OpenHours
fresh and tasty,while the Ambience was  relaxing, sat on the A_Plc_Patio surrounded by tall palm trees lite with decorative A_Decor
the Service was friendly and prompt
great for larger groups of people
a regular stop of mine when traveling through clt
the Food is regularly of good F_FI_Quality, the takeaway selection is great, the S_Staff are P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and my Service is always quick
my most recent stop in was just last week - picked up a F_FoodItem for takeaway as i only had 30m between connecting flights
the Restaurant is A_LocatedArea in an open area of the hibernate 'between terminal wings' area so Restaurant isn't an enclosed A_Fur_Table area - the closest you can get to A_OutsideView A_Fur_Table while being inside an airport terminal
being that the customers are usually on the way to somewhere else, the S_Staff are used to S_Staff at a pace to keep everyone moving it seems
not in a pushy way to get you out, just swift enough to keep you moving on time to your final destination
the F_FoodItem won't make you sick and it is a refreshing change from the usual fare of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/deep-fried and greasy Food you get in airport terminals
please do not Service me mealy F_FoodItem
i live in noda and i really want to start to like the places in my A_Environment so i don't have to drive far and can walk!! came in and sat up at the A_Plc_Bar
the front door is really beautiful (old, wooden, big) the rest of the A_Decor is kinda like whatever
doesn't really look finished
nice girl behind the A_Plc_Bar, asked S_Staff about some of the F_Drinks S_Staff let me try two one being the cask F_Drinks, which surprisingly i liked but i would've liked it a little colder
i know, i know i'm a silly american!!  we started with a pretzel that was barely warm, but the F_Ingredients was good
also had the homemade F_FoodItem with F_Drinks F_FoodItem, the F_FoodItem were good but the F_FoodItem had a weird Food and was again not very P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm
we then moved on and had the peel and eat F_FoodItem, they came in a pint glass and i could smell them from the A_Furniture that they sat in for a while
they were bad, warm, mealy, fishy, and mushy!! i took them and put them about a A_Furniture away from me because i thought i was going to get sick from the smell! in an attempt to get the F_FoodItem flavor out of our mouths we decided on the F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
no F_FI_Taste at all, and once again not very warm!! this time being because the S_Staff were P_S_Stf_Availability/busy standing there talking and not ready to bring us our Food
they all were staring right at it and continued to talk, then walked away, then came back for it! very P_O_Experience/frustrating, i almost got up to get it myself! i mean that way i would have had it when it was hot
well maybe!! this Restaurant had maybe 5 people in it so not a very busy night i just thought that with it not being busy it would've been better
i was wrong! the only saving grace to this Food was when we got our check and Food was thankfully not that P_F_FI_Price/expensive!!
so we were trying to decide between a S_Menu of possible Food spots
a lot of our normal ones had been visited too recently or often, but somebody P_O_Experience/suggested to go for the non-usual thai and specifically directed us Restaurant
not a bad choice
we sat down at first, then we decided to S_Delivery to-go in the interest of saving time
i had my eye on the F_FI_Price Food special and settled on a F_FoodItem pad thai
F_FoodItem came with a side F_FoodItem (fresh), F_Appetizer with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem (decent, not P_F_FI_Healthy/salty or F_FI_Taste), F_FoodItem (well
no, it didn't for to-go, wtf?) and two potstickers (good)
while i haven't S_Delivery the regular option for comparison purposes, the portion that i got looked like a full Food, not reduced for Food
besides the lack of F_FoodItem, my only real issue was that the fork tines were a little too small to make good work of the F_FoodItem, so it was a little difficult to eat
the F_FoodItem was a little chewy, but not too bad, and there was actually more F_FoodItem that i anticipated, so i wound up eating a lot of F_FoodItem and rationing F_FoodItem toward the end
regardless, i'd definitely consider this Restaurant again for a quick local thai fix
came on a saturday night around 7 and were sat immediately
it is a A_Env_Size place with a A_Plc_Bar capable of A_Fur_Table 15 or so and about 15 A_Fur_Table
i'm not sure if it's a nightly occurrence but there was a gentleman playing on their A_Ent_Music and a young lady A_Ent_LiveShow
it provided a nice Ambience
the S_Menu consists of apps, F_FoodItem, a few F_FoodItem, F_FI_Religious Food and F_FoodItem
we had the stuffed F_FoodItem as an app and weren't too P_O_Experience/impressed
Food weren't terrible, just nothing special
the Food were a different story
my husband's F_FoodItem was to die for
great flavor, perfectly cooked F_FoodItem with just the right amount of each F_Ingredients
i had the F_FoodItem and it hit the spot
F_Ingredients was tender and had just the right amount of breading
their F_FoodItem is homemade and P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic
i could've eaten it with a spoon all on its own
the portion was quite generous and was accompanied by F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
our only compliant was that they do not offer draft F_Drinks and their bottled F_Drinks selection was very limited
while many F_FI_Religious Food Food are not listed on the S_Menu our S_Staff informed us that Food like F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem are available upon request
i was pretty skeptical about the S_Menu at first, since all the Food descriptions were pretty plain
Food turned out to be really P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, though!the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem is really F_Ingredients-y with just the right amount of F_Ingredients that didn't overpower all the flavor
we also had the braised F_FoodItem shoulder which was really tender and well-seasoned
the F_FoodItem on top was a really nice contrast in Food and gave it a refreshing bite
being serenaded by the live A_Ent_Music on the canal was nice, despite the loud gaggles of asian tourists snapping photos with their ipads
this was almost a 4-O_Exp_StarsByCus review, but i am docking a O_Exp_StarsByCus for the following reason:the O_Payment came out while my boyfriend was in the A_Plc_Bathroom, so i put my card in and O_Payment
when the check came back out for us to sign, the S_Staff / host (he was checking people in but was also checking on the A_Fur_Table, so i assume he was some kind of S_Staff) handed it to my boyfriend and said, "thank you, stephen
" it may have been an innocent mistake, but it definitely came off as misogyny
it's the 21st century - women are allowed to pick up the tab once in a while
poor form!
i am so P_O_Experience/disappointed
let me preface this with saying the lady S_Staff, who took our S_Delivery for take out was really, really P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
somehow the S_Staff got the wrong address and went to the neighbors' house, but as luck would have it, i was outside and caught him
S_Staff was also super sweet
now, the Food
we like our Food P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot
hot! our S_Staff had asked on a scale of 1-5 hot how did we like it
we said 10
we eat ghost F_FoodItem
we like Food P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot
S_Staff laughed and said ok, no problem
the Food came quickly (and we are a bit away)
we ordered the F_FI_Taste and F_FI_Taste F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, hunan F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and hot and sour F_Appetizer
sadly, the Food was not good at all
not terrible, but not good
when we S_Delivery hot, we expect F_Ingredients F_FoodItem to be used
they used F_Ingredients oil in the hunan Food and the hot and sour F_Appetizer
it was soooo greasy i had to wash the lids off of everything because it was everywhere
and it was not hot at all
the F_Ingredients of the Food would have been good, but it was soaked in F_Ingredients
the hot and F_FI_Taste F_Appetizer had so much F_Ingredients, it was floating on top
and there was no F_FoodItem in the F_Appetizer
i am used to at least some F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
just F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Size/thick, which i like, but i had to scrape the oil off the top
the F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, but they came with no F_Ingredients
and the sweet and sour F_FoodItem came with the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem in a container by itself, with the F_Ingredients on the side
fine
i get that
they didn't want it mushy when it got here
i like that
but it was only F_FoodItem in the container
no F_FoodItem, no F_FoodItem, no F_FoodItem, just the F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was ok
but nothing to mix in with the F_FoodItem
i give this O_Exp_StarsByCus a 2 because the S_Staff was extremely nice, and even called us back to apologize for the driver having the wrong address and stating S_Staff wanted to update their system so they had it right the next time
when S_Staff called, after we had eaten, we told S_Staff our Food was not P_F_FI_Taste/spicy at all, as promised, but said next time S_Staff would do better
i will give them another chance because of their customer Service and how lovely the lady was
but let's hope it doesn't come with a pound of oil in and on everything
i am so P_O_Experience/disappointed
i was excited to try this Restaurant
and it turned out to be like almost all of the F_Ingredients Restaurant in town
dear golden S_Staff,please, please, please! use F_Ingredients, not F_Ingredients oil
and add something to your sweet and sour F_FoodItem
because the F_Ingredients on the F_FoodItem, and the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was pretty P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
and your customer Service was so wonderful
:( :(
my friends and i came Restaurant to try their prefixe S_Menu for Restaurant week; however, we arrived a bit too late and missed it
instead, the three of us shared the grilled octopus for the F_Appetizer, F_FoodItem for Food, and their dark Food F_Ingredients flourless F_FoodItem for F_Dessert
everything F_FI_Taste great and Food were perfect F_FI_Size portions for three people
the octopus and sea bass were F_FI_CookingLevel very well, both prepared with lemon, F_FoodItem oil and F_Ingredients
some people have complained about the bones in the F_FoodItem but they were removed when it was Service to us
we also S_Delivery F_Drinks and the O_Payment came out to F_FI_Price each including tip
if you don't S_Delivery the signature Food for the Food, you can walk over to their little "F_FoodItem market" and choose something else to be F_FI_CookingLevel up for you
thought this was interesting
i would definitely P_O_Experience/come_back and try something  from Restaurant
love how F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh!
so so so good! i had the F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem and i enjoy every bite! great design of a place
so well done
the first time i tried spinato's F_FoodItem was when my friend introduced me to it with carryout over the summer
we went with the P_F_FI_Size/thin F_FoodItem and i really P_O_Experience/enjoyed it
the next time i was in town i stopped in and tried the Restaurant itself, and really had a good time
i don't know what this place was before, but i swear it used to be a F_Ingredients's
i could be wrong, but either way, its really well A_Decor
warm well decorated A_Decor with a full A_Plc_Bar and a great S_Menu
lots to choose from, and not just F_FoodItem (even though its their specialty
)i really like the A_Decor of this Restaurant
not overstated, but classy enough that you can take your parents Restaurant and not have them freak out like mine do
Restaurant feels like a great date spot too
Service was great, and i really had a good time and the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem i had were P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
i would come Restaurant again in a heartbeat
check it out, worth the trip if you want something different and want to have a good time
this review is courtesy of my fellow yelpers
typed in "Restaurant", "las vegas", and "highest O_Exp_StarsByCus" and carlo's kitchen popped up
eh, why not? great reviews and the fan photos really helped making the final dining decision very easy
inside of charlie's bar, say what? who would have known such a Food eatery could be found nestled inside of a typical vegas pub? yelpers, that's who!no sooner did my party get sat our very P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive S_Staff came to grab our F_Drinks S_Delivery
glasses never empty and our palates totally P_O_Experience/satisfied we thoroughly P_O_Experience/enjoyed our Food Restaurant at carlos
from succulent F_FoodItem chops to perfectly seasoned F_FoodItem and a F_FoodItem that will make you want thirds, you will not be P_O_Experience/disappointed
take away the A_Plc_Bar aspect of this Restaurant and it the point has been made that the Food is out of this world; lets get to my most favorite part of this dining O_Experience
the S_Staff in charge of all Food that leave the A_Plc_Kitchen personally came out to S_Stf_Behavior our A_Fur_Table! not only did S_Staff come out to greet us at the beginning of our Food but he checked on our A_Fur_Table of (7) after our feeding frenzy came to a close to follow up
a brilliant display of customer Service that i honestly thought was completely lost in this city
thank you carlo's kitchen for bringing back the feel of an old world dining O_Experience where it feels like the entire S_Staff actually gives a crap about creating a positive dining O_Experience
you will see us again for sure!
i just moved to charlotte and i'm very happy to announce
i've found my brunch place
terrace Restaurant is the bomb
com and i know i will definitely P_O_Experience/be_back to try some of the other things on their S_Menu
i live in rock hill but drove to ballantyne in search of some yummy brunch
i had tried  a couple hole in the wall places near rock hill but none were anything to write home about
this Restaurant most definitely did not P_O_Experience/disappoint
it was a monday morning, so i can't really comment on what the weekend wait is like but we were A_Fur_Table immediately
the Ambience was nice; trendy but casual
good for girlfriends, a brunch date with your significant other or even Food with the kids
Service was pretty good
our S_Staff checked in a few times and our Food was Service in a good amount of S_Del_Time
i started with a F_Ingredients F_FoodItem
yum
i saw that Restaurant was a F_FoodItem, but i'm going to save that for a sunday funday
for the F_FoodItem Food, i S_Delivery F_Appetizer & F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
damn
the F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem were out of this world
the F_Appetizer F_FI_Taste fresh and fluffy, while the F_FoodItem was definitely homemade and very P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
the F_FoodItem were a little P_F_FI_Healthy/salty, but i like salty
Food were also very P_F_FI_Taste/crisp
F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh a good S_Menu of F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem - i don't really like that average F_FoodItem S_Cutlery with just melon & F_FoodItem, so i was pleased
the S_Menu also had some very interesting Food like F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, buffalo F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and a red velvet waffle that i would love to try
it may be a little premature to say this is the best Food in charlotte but it's definitely a solid standby
if you're looking for a place, this is it
love love love dim sum needed a fix and didn't want to drive across town to get it
so we pull up and they don't open till S_OpenHours : / my bad for not checking first
there was a farmers market on this day right down the way
so we wasted some time until they opened
starving by the time we get in and i know better the to be some of the first few customers for dimsum : /   the selection was nill to none again my bad
so we got a few of our favorites and by the time the good stuff was coming out we were full
the Food we did have was good, very flavorful and prepared well
the F_FI_Size of the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem we got seemed P_F_FI_Size/larger then normal
the F_FI_Price of the Food were a bit more P_F_FI_Price/expensive then china town but it is in a higher rent district, so understandable
i don't know if i will be back but in a pinch i would
we choose a Restaurant for consistency but when the F_FoodItem is full of the part no one wants to eat it ruins the whole O_Experience
please cut the fat, literally!
had the country P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
it was awesome! red velvet F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious with the cream F_FoodItem syrup!
this is the definition of the american diet
huge A_Places for really heavy Food
out of all the Food we S_Delivery, we really liked the philly F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and the F_FoodItem
we'd stay away from the F_FoodItem & F_FoodItem
huge portions Restaurant
who doesn't want that in vegas
padlocked and S_OpenHours with an eviction notice taped to the front door
this A_LocatedArea is quite close to work, and at times when morale is low or he feels like he's been kind of a jerk lately, the boss will get us a couple F_FoodItem from frank's F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
i have had some regular P_F_FI_Quality/old F_FoodItem from Restaurant in the past, and they were definitely better than average
but the famed buffalo F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
oh boy
the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and at the perfect level of chewiness, the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Size/large and tender, the buffalo F_Ingredients is spicy and not too greasy, and the F_FoodItem blankets all in wonderfulness
then you get sides of F_Ingredients, and it's homemade!  thick and rich and you can F_FI_Taste all the lovely dill they've put in Restaurant
it's the best dipping F_Ingredients ever
it was so good that i felt indebted to the S_Staff for this wonderful S_Gift and volunteered to stay late
perhaps this will be positive reinforcement and he'll buy me F_FoodItem more often
hands down the best Food on the strip
wicked spoon is amazing, but baccahanal blows even them out of the F_Drinks
i can't imagine coming to vegas again and not eating Restaurant
had dinner at the A_Plc_Bar
stayed at encore
andrea's was the best Food on our trip
the Service and the Food were the best
the rock F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and the mango avocado and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, and the strip F_FoodItem with wasabi demi glaze was also very good
definitely P_O_Experience/coming_back !
the ramen expert in me wants to cringe when i eat the ramen
lol but i also know that i'm not in japan or california, and this is probably better than most ramen places in tempe
well, it's better than republic ramen
if that is saying much? however, it's probably from the same people of republic ramen
the F_FoodItem, the S_Menu and the style is just too similar
and F_FoodItem just as P_F_FI_Price/expensive
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem
no F_Ingredients and it was F_FI_Price
additional F_Ingredients are at least $1 per F_Ingredients, and that is ridiculous
i don't know where these S_Staff learned to make F_FoodItem but please
no more F_FoodItem
it ruins the Food and F_Ingredients of the F_FoodItem
i don't even want to ask why there is F_Ingredients available as a F_Ingredients
i'll just get P_O_Experience/annoyed
-______-better off going back to cherry blossoms for their F_FoodItem (which actually F_FI_Taste like japanese F_FoodItem)
best mexican Food ever! i have been going to this Restaurant for years and i love the new A_LocatedArea
the Food F_FI_Taste just the same and i wish i could go every day
i always get the F_FoodItem
it is very popular for a reason ;)
this is my first time coming Restaurant
i really am a fan of gus' s F_FoodItem
the Food is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and customer Service is awesome
Restaurant is fast and very clean!! hope you get to enjoy gus' s F_FoodItem soon!!!
wow! this Restaurant is absolutely incredible! i came in on a thursday night and it wasn't super packed, senator harry reid had just came in with his wife to eat
one of the S_Staff was so amazing and i had some of the best Service
i split the combo special and the Food was so good, but did have a lot of Food
we got complimentary F_Drinks and F_Dessert on the house and the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was unbelievable! it's house made and cannot be missed
another overdone steak and utterly P_S_Stf_Behavior/inattentive S_Staff! still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care
so, we finally got the attention of a S_Staff who was not our S_Staff, michael
S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/kind_enough to take my F_FoodItem back to the kitchen
michael, our S_Staff, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my F_FoodItem was being prepared again
he does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes
the S_Staff makes an appearance and brings me a strip F_FoodItem that looks rare from the sight of it
he informs me that my F_FoodItem is on him and apologizes
he goes away
i cut into my F_FoodItem and it's, you guessed it, pittsburgh rare
i asked for medium rare
he returns and i tell him that the S_Staff needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a F_FoodItem
the S_Staff apologizes again and asks me if i want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! not only is it rare but it's a P_O_Pay_Price/cheap cut of strip F_FoodItem that is loaded with connective gristle
i said no thanks
he comped my husband's Food and we left
i never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the S_Staff really need some serious retraining! i will never P_O_Experience/go_back to this applebee's again
worst drive thru Service ever
they didn't tell me the total cost of my S_Delivery till i got up to the window
it took a couple mins
before anyone even came to the window, and then i had to sit Restaurant for almost 10 mins before i got my Food
a drive thru is suppose a little quicker Service of getting your Food
and the Food was not W_Price the price i paid for it
this is not the first S_Del_Time i've had this kind of Service Restaurant
the people working Restaurant also don't seem like they want to be Restaurant
i don't know why i even tried going back
canyon cafe is in the top five of favorite Restaurant to eat
my fiance and i recently celebrated our anniversary at canyon cafe
pro: the chips and F_FoodItem rock my world! the F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Experience/efficient
the Ambience is P_A_Env_Type/quiet and relaxed
con: the carnitas tacos are very greasy
canyon cafe exceeds our expectations every S_Del_Time
you go for Food but you stay for the chips and F_FoodItem
the chip basket includes sweet potato, blue corn, wonton, and F_FI_Size tortilla chips
the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted and heavenly
P_O_Experience/recommended: the bison F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem is juicy and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
the F_FoodItem, love the sauce and F_FoodItem is tender
the top shelf margarita, P_O_Experience/suggested to share but make sure to stir or the tequila will go straight to your head
can't wait to P_O_Experience/go_back
Restaurant our P_A_Env_Size/little secret Restaurant that we enjoy because Restaurant P_A_Env_Type/quiet and we usually leave feeling quite euphoric
the F_FoodItem they're advertising now is amazing!Service was quite good; i've been here before and it isn't always good
clean enough
decent O_Pay_Price
amazing Food
it's authentic mexican Food not that pseudo mexican Food catered towards gringos like some Restaurant
Restaurant was cool Ambience with nice A_Decor
the F_Appetizer are served P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and hot with P_F_FI_Taste/tasty F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem will change your life
the F_FoodItem is great too
the F_Dessert desert is a1
O_Pay_Price is very reasonable
it came to 34$ for 2 with F_Dessert
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasty too
the F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic
we S_Delivery the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Size/huge
great Food
fair O_Pay_Price
i'll P_O_Experience/be_back
why, oh, why is teppanyaki such a challenge!?!  it is the ultimate in party cuisine and a great O_Experience, plus the Food seems that much better cooked in front of you
somehow though phoenix remains without a great teppan Restaurant
my nephew is an asian Food junkie and loves teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great O_Experience and sakana remained one of two Restaurant in town we have not tried so onward
we were sat immediately about 15 minutes prior to our O_Reservation and quickly S_Delivery F_Drinks and F_FoodItem
after reading other reviews i walked over to the F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar and looked at the day's specials
we S_Delivery two types of nigiri off the special board and then uni and P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem
for my nephew we got a P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem
there was nothing wrong with any of it
the F_FoodItem had a clean F_FI_Taste and was very good
it was a pleasant surprise
the teppan started with a decent F_FoodItem and salad
the show itself was good, not great
the Food of the F_FoodItem were astonishing, absolutely P_F_FI_Size/huge
same with the veggies
the F_FoodItem was good and came in the standard cup
a little odd was that the F_FoodItem and veggies were an add on for an additional $3
not a big deal but just different
overall all the F_FoodItem and the shrimp were okay
i took a piece of my husband's steak as teppan steak i always feel has the best F_FI_Taste for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it F_FI_Taste like typical steak
so basically the whole Food O_Experience was a standard
nothing really standing out, nothing bad
on the other side was the Service
lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind
my sister said she felt she bussed our table
since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table
think about the number of items i mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  i had to ask to get water and F_Drinks refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way
a pitcher could have been so much simpler
it took a good 15 S_Del_Time for my sister's beverage to come from the A_Plc_Bar
it was almost an hour before the teppan S_Staff came over
the S_Staff though was P_S_Stf_Behavior/personable enough that the non-Service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances
i doubt i will P_O_Experience/be_back, but it wasn't a bad O_Experience and for someone in the ahwatukee area i would say if they have S_Del_Time and don't have a ton of money to spend on teppan or F_FoodItem it is not  a bad choice
this Restaurant has hands down the best healthy options ever! this is not your typical pancake, egg and hashbrown Restaurant that only lets you sub toast for sausage
no
this Restaurant is legit alternative choices to keep your heart healthy and your body unbloated by sodium
why do i say this? pancakes
want whole wheat pancakes? ok
want whole wheat with organic flax seed, organic agave syrup, F_FoodItem, almond, and a shot of protein powder in it? ok!!!!! i kid you not, they have a mind blowing amount of options for your pancakes
at addition O_Pay_Price, of course :)
my boyfriend got a healthy plate of Food (nice and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh) an egg white scramble with turkey, and a side of whole wheat pancakes (for just a dollar more!) and i got a plate full of P_F_FI_Size/huge F_FoodItem and a side of hashbrowns (cuz i'm a fatty)
the F_FoodItem were unfortunately not to my liking as some were P_F_FI_CookingLevel/over_cooked to the point of being burned, and others were still raw
the F_FoodItem, however, were pretty good
with our room key we got a 10% discount and it all came out to 17$ before the tip
wonderful Service especially if u get beth   everything outstanding to include the hot bean dip to start things off
another tourist spot
this Restaurant is not about the Food as much as it is about the novelty and character
fun spot for kids and families!and, even if you've been Restaurant a million S_Del_Time, someone ought to wear a tie just for giggles
i don't understand why it only gets a 3
5 star in general reviews because i have become a huge sweet tomatoes fan of the tempe Ambience in a matter of 3 months
before i moved to tempe, i knew about sweet tomatoes only because it was my vegan friend's shrine and she P_O_Experience/suggested a double date Restaurant one S_Del_Time
well, at that S_Del_Time, i visualized this Restaurant as a buffet with unappetizing lettuce leafs and drippy salad dressing, like the salad A_Plc_Bar in a university cafeteria that i never visited
given that i was generally skeptical of my vegetarian friend's recommendation and particularly skeptical of how good soup-and-salad can possibly be, the idea of a double date Restaurant was
kind of out of the question
now i have the good fortune of living really close to a sweet tomatoes
now i want to go Restaurant all the time, whether it is a single, double, triple, quadruple, or quintuple dates!things i love about sweet tomatoes:1) seasonally changing S_Menu
the S_Menu features the freshest ingredients in season and the low price reflects that
last month i experienced an asian-inspired buffet, and this week is a potato-fest
i like surprises!2) amazing F_FoodItem
i would have to spend 7~10 bucks on some bland, refrigerated boxed salad from Restaurant close to where i work
but why get that if i can build my own P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem, for almost the same O_Pay_Price (plus other amazing goodies)? the dressing, by the way, is the reason why i don't attempt to make my own salad at home
3) P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm, P_F_FI_Taste/yummy F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
in Restaurant serving good F_FoodItem, i would finish a whole basket of complimentary F_FoodItem before my entree
yes, i am a carb snob and in desperate need of Food control when it comes to carbs
here, i love the selection of mini-bite, fresh-out-of-the-oven cornbread, orange/cranberry muffins, chocolate brownies, and blueberry muffins
the are the perfect F_FI_Size, and give me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside
4) homemade soups
i love all the sweet tomatoe F_FoodItem soups: the clear-broth chunky F_FoodItem noodle soup, and the creamy F_FoodItem wild rice soup
i tried the curry lentil soup and i remember it made me very happy
the soup selection changes every S_Del_Time i go but i think the chunky F_FoodItem noodle soup is a staple
5) P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful, P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff
S_Staff are super P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly Restaurant
they would walk around and give out a plate of warm and gooey chocolate-chip cookies to tables where people almost finish with their Food
the S_Staff not just smile to you, but also talk to you
each Food item is labeled clearly with a description of the F_Ingredients, but apparently i can ask for recipes as well!*a side note: the S_Staff really P_S_Stf_Behavior/care about Food hygiene
i noticed one S_Del_Time the lady filling the salad A_Plc_Bar had some mushrooms fell outside the tray
she didn't put them  back (even though Restaurant were literally on the verge of the salad tray) but threw them away
it is really basic, but i don't think all Restaurant have trained their S_Staff to do that
6) kid-friendly A_Environment
i always lament the fact that kids don't eat their vegetables
to get them to eat veggies, you probably have to wrap a F_FoodItem stick in bacon, put on a buttermilk batter, and deep fry it in butter
i think sweet tomatoes is helping to change our Food culture
i am very proud of the kids i have seen at the sweet tomatoes who eat a hearty serving of vegetables before digging into the frozen yogurt!maybe i am writing an unnecessarily long review
but i think this Restaurant deserves more applause! true, it is not on your micheline star guide, not the one-of-a-kind neighborhood gem, never featured on man v
food or triple d, and surely not where you would call for an anniversary Food O_Reservation
F_FoodItem is simple, P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, lovely, P_F_FI_Price/inexpensive, and best of all, in moderation
this is where i would go for a weekend brunch when i don't want greasiness and excessiveness in my system
i used to love this Restaurant but i have noticed the F_FI_Quality in Food has gone a bit and the rude Service about always telling my party that the tables a reserved and that we only have at least 45 min to eat if we still want to be seated
are u freaking kidding me?! how are the same tables always reserved at "7:30pm"?!?!?! finally someone told me who used to work Restaurant says that is just a lie! Restaurant are no O_Reservation!!! they reserve that for people who has a party of 4 or more, so it doesnt matter if u came first w/ a group of 3 people, the party with 4 or more who comes in after u gets the A_Fur_Table
i can't stand this rude Service anymore
read the other comments everyone, see the pattern about the A_Fur_Table??? lol reserve my butt

busy Restaurant
S_Menu has a mish mash of things, from gyros to lasagne
i had the gyro platter and dh had the gyro and pork kabob platter
first off, the gyro F_FoodItem reminds me of F_FoodItem in texture and F_FoodItem was very P_F_FI_Healthy/salty
they put some kind of gravy on it
the F_FoodItem was good
F_FoodItem
well, they're F_FoodItem
signs everywhere saying, "we work for tips
" however, aside from bringing the Food to the table they really don't do much to earn a tip
in addition, we O_Pay_Method with a card and Restaurant wasn't a line for a tip anyway
overall, tried it once
will not P_O_Experience/go_again
good Food
it is obvious you aren't in a chain Restaurant and i like that
this is a great Restaurant for a big group of friends
the Food is good, the vibe is super comfortable and since it's already going to be loud and crowded, your group won't stand out much
i've been here for large group birthdays, and small group hanging out before a night on the town
Food has always been S_Delivery out quite P_S_Del_Time/quickly, and with a big group if you give them the ok they'll bring Food out as it's ready vs
trying to wait for the entire table's S_Delivery to be ready
not only is the Food good, it gives you that comfort Food kind of feeling
yummy cheesy goodness
four peaks wow
very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty F_FoodItem
went with several friends
Ambience was calm, casual and the Service was good too, oh yeah, great F_Drinks
if you like lamb you can't go wrong with some lamb chops or the lamb shank! the Service is excellent and quick
this Restaurant is amazing, their F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, S_Staff S_Staff is extremely P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and their Food is to drool for
hadoken!

new to the area and went for F_Drinks and F_FoodItem based on the good reviews
once we went inside we immediately decided to take the F_FoodItem to go
it is so dark and dreary in Restaurant you can barely see
after S_Delivery the F_FoodItem we decided to get some F_Drinks while we wait
nothing on tap, but a few craft selections in bottles
we saw you could buy a 6 pack for $8 which is a killer deal
we got sierra nevada pale ale and cracked one open
it had gone bad
we asked to change it out for alaskan amber
that had gone bad too
we ended up throwing the 6 pack away, which i don't do
the F_FoodItem was not square as they boast but round
and it looks nothing like the photos on the outside of the building or on their website
P_F_FI_Size/small and scarce F_FoodItem with a cracker P_F_FI_Size/thin F_FoodItem
F_FI_Taste like the F_FoodItem you get at an arcade or a bowling alley
my guess is F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen
we would have been better off getting a freezer F_FoodItem and 6 pack from albertsons across the street
and F_FoodItem would have been a lot P_O_Pay_Price/cheaper
$26 of junk we through out
we would never P_O_Experience/go_back
amazing
best steak ever
had the bone in ribeye and was outstanding
Service was excellent, Food was P_F_FI_Price/pricey but W_Price it
by far the most elegant and expensive Restaurant i've ever eaten at
we made O_Reservation for a wednesday night, but found that Restaurant was no need for it
Restaurant is a dress code, but i noticed a family walk in with jeans an a sweater but they still sat them anyway
pretty good Service, but you expect that at a Restaurant like this
in my opinion though, it felt a little overbearing
i couldn't figure out who exactly was our S_Staff
Restaurant was a different person for each task; wine S_Delivery, Food S_Delivery, drink S_Delivery
a different person who brought us water, our Food, F_Dessert, etc
as far as the Food, incredible
as an F_Appetizer, i got the F_FoodItem bisque soup
it was smooth and sweet, perfect!  for the entree, i got the vegetable medley and my husband got the duck
F_FoodItem very P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem, i had nothing bad to say about either one
nothing felt like F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/undercooked or P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked
for F_Dessert, i got the banana foster souffle
it was my first S_Del_Time ever having a souffle, and as far as souffles go, the A_Plc_Bar is set pretty high
overall, i P_O_Experience/enjoyed my O_Experience here
when coming here though, expect to spend over $100 on a 3-course Food for 2
the steak was amazing and of course if you can get a seat outside on the balcony Restaurant is no better A_OutsideView in vegas
the wine list is a bit P_F_FI_Price/over-priced and the Service wasn't the best as they forgot us in the A_Plc_Bar while waiting for a table for over an hour (it was a 20 S_Del_Time wait)
overall though a great Restaurant and fabulous Food!

talk about P_O_Experience/disappointment
and regret
we were told by one of our guys that caesar's had a great buffet, and who were we to argue?  it's still one of the nicer resorts on the strip
we got Restaurant memorial day morning, and while we weren't P_O_Experience/surprised that we got charged the weekend O_Pay_Price, it was a bit weird that it was next to empty
we found out why
you don't get nearly what you O_Payment for to come here
the selection really comes down to the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
Restaurant wasn't much variety in the Food, and they didn't S_Delivery P_S_Del_Time/quickly enough (Restaurant was a point where was no fresh fruit to be found at all!)  also, even though someone said that F_FI_Quality beats out F_FI_Size, it sure sucks when you have to wait in line to get Food
and really, it's not that much better than other Restaurant
on its own it's passable, but with so many better options around for the same O_Pay_Price, it's really not W_Price it to go
i come here quite often since it's close to work and not too expensive
i love this Restaurant for a couple or reasons
consistency and a decent F_FoodItem
i'm born and raised in az so i don't know what a "true" F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste like so for me this Restaurant is pretty darn good
the F_FoodItem is always nice and soft and the steak is great with the whiz and onions
their F_FoodItem are always perfectly P_F_FI_Taste/crispy and soft on the inside every S_Del_Time
they have F_FoodItem as well but i don't ever seem to be in a F_FoodItem mood when i go here so i've yet to try it
i'm deducing a star on this because the chairs and tables are in some serious need of replacing and Restaurant is a lot of dust on the walls and upper ledges above the booth seating
i've seen enough episodes of cooking shows to know this isn't acceptable
great Food though and i will continue to P_O_Experience/come_back!

not W_Price it!  the Food is below average, Service is bad, the Restaurant is not anything special
i would not P_O_Experience/go_back
Restaurant are too many great Restaurant on the strip to go to waste your S_Del_Time on this rinky dink establishment
the F_Drinks are pathetic
S_Del_Time for refills
my husband had to wait for a new pot of F_Drinks which took 10 minutes
the extra S_Staff who gets water etc is a joke
unfortunately i have no choice to give 1 O_Exp_StarsByCus
this Restaurant is a big 0!

amazing! my favorite Food of our trip! Service was spot on
i started out with the temple salad and my husband the egg rolls
both were phenomenal! during our stay i had salmon on 3 different nights
tao was the best! my husband had filet mignon F_FoodItem steak and the steak melted in your mouth
for F_Dessert we had ice cream and F_FoodItem
again
P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! and the F_FoodItem are my favorite
i never tried tao in ny, but now i am going too! thank you tao for an amazing Food!!

it was a cold and rainy night
i headed to vegas for the cure
the cure was tom yum soup with F_FoodItem from archi's
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot
why 2 hots? because i S_Delivery spice level 5 from the option of 1 to 10
as i get older, i find the spice level i'm able to tolerate keeps getting lower
that's a shame
my 18 year old self would laugh at me now
back to my review
the F_FI_Quality of the Food, friendly Service and reasonable O_Pay_Price make this a solid 4 O_Exp_StarsByCus in my book
went here with a 50% off coupon sold to me by the tix4tonight booth
i was P_O_Experience/disappointed
F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked and looked unappetizing in general
actually, the F_FoodItem taco was good, but the shrimp and mahi mahi were mediocre at best
the soda F_FI_Taste funky, to the point where my bf sent his back
A_Environment looks like a P_A_Env_Type/fun Restaurant to drink at night and they have live music and a tropical cabana theme
they also had a claw machine with live F_FoodItem, (you catch it, they cook it
) A_Environment'd probably be a P_A_Env_Type/fun Restaurant to go drink with friends
but as far as Food goes, if you're in vegas, do yourself a favor and eat at one of the other million Restaurant
bajio makes me sing "loco gringos like a party
" okay, so bajio isn't really where you go to party i was just compelled to use rev
horton heat lyrics in this review
you could say it's like that old joke Restaurant's a party in your mouth and everyone's coming
except it's the bajio Food that's making the party in your mouth
um, where is this going? bajio is *krills! the brightly A_Decor hold the enormous and very cool A_Decor (prints?) on the walls, the weathered dangling lamps bajio's A_Decor makes you feel as though you should be in san diego and not next to a home depot off of flamingo
when you get down to business and make your S_Delivery the set up is that station style (like subway) where you get to pick and chose the variety of beans, rice, F_FoodItem, etc
everything down to the sour cream is seasoned and that's what makes bajio different from the other chains of mexican Food joints
it's not authentic but it's a Restaurant that you can prolly bring those who don't like mexican Food and they would eat it and you'd be happy to be Restaurant
*krills is street for crack rock
delicious upscale casual fare
excellent Service
i had the salmon
overall a very nice O_Experience
when i walked in here, i felt like i was in a S_Del_Time warp
this Restaurant was say A_Decor by someone with little more skill than me
i would not say inviting or especially welcoming, but
i really P_O_Experience/enjoyed the Food here and this is why they get the 4 O_Exp_StarsByCus
the only thing that could have pushed them to a 5 would have been better Service but this is a fantastic korean Restaurant
never having had this Food until as an adult, i can tell you in beginning i was not P_O_Experience/impressed and only ate the korean bbq,  but about 28 years ago, i was working in korea and fell in love with the FoodRestaurant are three simply reasons to come here and if the three are speaking to you, move on to another Restaurant
soondobu - if you like the nice P_F_FI_Taste/spicy soft F_FoodItem, this is the Restaurant to go!  when yelpers lisa s
say this is like their mothers pork soondobu or christopher s give it a good review, i gotta try it
you can pick the spice level
and, like lisa says, this is something like you expect home made from your mom or grand ma
and like christopher s says, you have to do the soup, rice mouth, or the rice soup mouth routine to eat this properly!samgyetong - korean ginseng F_FoodItem - i have spent many a winters in the early days in korea doing work and it is freezing cold to the bone
this F_FoodItem is so P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, warming and darn right simple that it always harkens in my memory the best of korean dining family or peasant style
this is a simple soup
if you like complex thick soups that are overpowering, this will F_FI_Taste more like hot dishwater to your tastebuds
however, if you have a delicate palate and very delicate tastebuds, you will know that this dishwater of F_FoodItem is absolutely more rich and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and refreshing!  the F_FoodItem itself is bland as well, it is boiled in water with minimal herbs, but it is so underwhelmingly just right
it is hard to describe
simple yet satisfying
i guess it is like have a P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled cheese F_FoodItem
simple yet satisfying
ban chan - i love all types of the small dishes of korean pickled or spiced vegetables and here the selection is the best
they had gobo, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, white F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Taste/yummy
so, if any of these are speaking to you, gotta get over here
if not, well, you will probably not care too much for this Restaurant
gk says
check it out!

went here for Food and had the kafte F_FoodItem stuffed in a puffed pita
the F_FoodItem was very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty but i thought F_FoodItem was a bit P_F_FI_Price/pricey
the Service was very attentive - my S_Staff almost ran to the kitchen when he heard S_Delivery ringing for pick up
i will have to P_O_Experience/go_back and see what other Food they have, but i think the Food would be good
F_FoodItem just P_F_FI_Price/pricey for what you get
that is why i am giving it a 3 star rather than 4 star - value for the money
been coming here for years since they opened back in 06 because the Food F_FI_Taste great
beats the pants off of panda express or kyoto bowl because the Food is made P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh when you S_Delivery
super psyched that the brand has expanded to a few other Ambience in the tempe and mesa area, hope they open shop in chandler next!

great pizza joint
upscale, with a side of P_F_FI_Size/small back east F_FoodItem joint
food is consistently good no matter when i go
great A_OutsideView on the A_Plc_Patio in chandler (only one i have been to so far)flavorful and about average price wise
would absolutely P_O_Experience/go_back again
i have to try out Restaurant other Ambience, gilbert would be my next stop
went here on sunday afternoon, went here a couple S_Del_Time when i first moved to vegas, but this was my first S_Del_Time back in years
i liked the Restaurant before and it still met my expectations
Ambience is laid back, seat yourself, dark pub
one thing i learned this S_Del_Time was they have no kids seats
and really no kids S_Menu
(though you can S_Delivery them a grill cheese or quesadilla for $4
99) losing some stars Restaurant
i had the F_FoodItem, which was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
big, juicy, with some maui onion, aged cheddar and heirloom tomato
though for $13
99 they could throw in some F_FoodItem
my wife had a reuben F_FoodItem which she liked
beer list is good, not great
i did have a rouge hazelnut brown 22oz
for $5
75 off draft, so not bad Restaurant
all in all the Food and Ambience, meet expectations for a standard pub
worth going to if that is what your looking for
very modern
very chic
very cool
it goes without saying that the Food at mix is incredible
celebrated S_Staff alain ducasse has created an inspired Restaurant
the only problem is that the O_Experience was not as memorable as i would have hoped from a S_Staff who has multiple 3 michelin star Restaurant in france
the S_Menu has undergone changes since mix first opened
although it now is "americanized" it lacks the classic dishes that one could only have P_O_Experience/enjoyed if they went to france or monte carlo
at least they still have the gnocchi
F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic as is the halibut with saffron braised potatoes in a bouillabaisse sauce
service is excellent
the wine list is extensive but prices run high even by vegas standards
a special note; it is W_Price taking the S_Del_Time to have a drink at the mix ultra lounge before Food
incredible A_OutsideView of the strip
good cocktails
finally, even if you book months in advance, you probably will not be given one of their window tables
a $50 "gratuity" to the host will assure that you do
its vegas baby!

pretty good Food and plenty of it! barbecue snobs need not eat here
yea, some will be put off by the smokiness of the 'cue but after being barbecue-deprived from nearly a year in the middle of nowhere it was some serious chow action! they also sell their F_FoodItem sauce (regular and P_F_FI_Taste/spicy), and some F_FoodItem tools as well as their magic dust dry rub, which i promptly shipped some to kwajalein!barbecue snobs need not eat here
i'm not one of 'em
if you've got a craving for 'cue, look no further!

go Restaurant for full F_FI_Taste, not for Ambience or A_Decor
many P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Food
i'm not a big thai Food fan, but i can tell full F_FI_Taste when i have it
this Restaurant was great! the Food was great, the Service was awesome (i'm lactose intolerant and they went out of their way to accommodate me), the drinks were great and the price isn't too bad (average for a steakhouse)
overall i would totally P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant and plan to P_O_Experience/visit_again
best aged-steak in vegas!the only down note was the rock music playing
it didn't fit with that type of fine-dining restaurant
my wife had the filet mignon
they brought out two (one for each of us) by mistake
when i told the S_Staff the correction he told me to enjoy the filet and that he would bring me my aged steak shortly
so
i had the turf-and-turf and it was sensational!

when we drove up to pearl for the first S_Del_Time, it appeared very upscale, A_Decor, high ceilings, modern furniture
however, not so much
the A_Decor tries to be upscale, but the plastic dishes and junk cluttering the walkway to the A_Plc_Patio brings it down
service is excellent, but Restaurant is no gluten free S_Menu, and S_Staff is not aware of gluten free items, except for gluten free soy sauce
food was fine
lots of fun drinks
if they are trying to appeal to the average working non-celiac patron, they've succeeded
again top notch british fare ven a little store where you can buy the british goods you miss so much from home this is a little gem at 16th street and bell
you should not miss Food saturdays and sundays are awesome you gotta do it for a traditional english brekkie

F_FI_Quality Service, F_FI_Quality Food, reasonably F_FI_Price, and the back A_Plc_Patio is so much fun for a classy girls night out!  the A_Decor of the house is dark and romantic for date nights
i always thought this was shwartz's lame brother, but after not wanting to be part of the museum like tourist line, as a local i wanted a good deli style F_FoodItem without the wait
le hibernate is well known for late night pub grub but having gone Restaurant recently with some out of towners it holds up as a great diner O_Experience
i S_Delivery the smoke F_FoodItem platter and smoked F_FoodItem poutine with cherry cotts! for about $44 it hit the spot and didn't have to get cattle proded in and out because of too many people
long story short, if your heart is set on visiting the graceland of smoked F_FoodItem then go and line up at shwartz's if you want to actually eat because your hungry you can cross the street sit down and S_Delivery great F_FoodItem here too
P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Food, snack and F_Drinks spot in the old port
between the four of us, we tried two different paninis, some wine, the raspberry-lime-lemonade (omg), a latté and an espresso
i skipped Food and went straight for the almond croissant, and have no regrets
it was served warm and was oh so tender and not too sweet
F_FoodItem was top-quality and very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
five stars for the Food
service was fast & friendly too (they now have table Service)
at 4 p
on a saturday, we had a 20-minute wait so went around the corner to the phi centre to check out the art installations
we found the Restaurant quite P_A_Env_Type/crowded and P_A_Env_Type/noisy -- that's what you get at a (deservedly) popular spot, i guess
prices were normal for the vieux port, about $12 for a F_FoodItem and $4-5 for a pastry
another coup de coeur from the book "devorer montréal" by claire bouchard & chantelle grady
came in here for Food today and although i was seated promptly, the Service was very very slow and it was hard to get a S_Staff's attention
i had decided what i wanted to S_Delivery and still no one was coming around to take my S_Delivery until it got down to me staring at the waitstaff
i wound up S_Delivery their smoked F_FoodItem spaghetti which was being advertised
it was good although i'm not crazy about smoked F_FoodItem but i figured i'd try it anyways
the other thing that sadly has landed this review down to two stars is the price
for what i had, the price was a little steep for my liking and refills on my soda weren't free which i suppose i should have thought to ask
anyways, i may or may not P_O_Experience/come_back depending on who i'm with
but i probably won't if i'm on my own like i was today
our favorite stop off the island
best on friday or saturday night when things are hopping and the S_Staff and kitchen keep things fresh and moving
great spirit, perfect F_FoodItem pan, rest of Food is good and pretty straight forward
you will never find the free wifi they promise, but the S_Menu is big and varied and you can get a bit of a line on some nights
hopping A_Plc_Bar, hockey is always on
so now that i live on the east side, i've come to really appreciate and enjoy alchemy
yes, A_Environment's P_A_Env_Size/small, and yes, Restaurant almost always a wait for a table
yes, they only take cash, but hey, Restaurant's an atm that only charges a $1 fee
despite those very minor inconveniences, the Restaurant is a true gem
nothing beats sitting at the A_Plc_Bar, enjoying one of the awesome taps they always have available (or a classic cocktail, or a very reasonable bottle of vino), with a plate of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem (which comes with a spread/dip that changes regularly), and then splitting an entree with a friend
i've yet to have F_FoodItem F_FoodItem isn't P_F_FI_Taste/delicious; from salads to F_FoodItem frys to the bella F_FoodItem - it's all superb
service has been consistently good, and the vibe/feel of the Restaurant is so welcoming
go
you won't regret it
hotpot? check! all-you-can-eat? check! i discovered this Restaurant several years ago and have been visiting ever since
gone is the buffet-style, you'll now find the whole Restaurant has been renovated and re-designed
you now S_Delivery each item from a S_Menu that you fill out, and the overall F_FI_Quality of the items has gone up from what i remember
everything F_FI_Taste fresh (beef, lamb, shrimp, squid, mussels, vegetables, tofu, F_FoodItem, sausage, noodles) and was presented quite nicely
what you lose by not being able to pick 1 piece of an item, you gained in F_FI_Quality
you can still self-serve soft drinks and mix up your own dipping sauce
Restaurant are also F_Dessert available with no charge (ice cream, sesame balls, canned fruit) and some items to buy for an additional charge
overall i think this system is an improvement and am already thinking about going back in a couple of weeks
this Restaurant poses as a wine A_Plc_Bar/restaurant, but frankly it would be better off if it just lost the bar bit
the Food is fabulous - something new will always take your fancy, but more so it is no of the ordinary, i cant think of anywhere else that does such a different S_Menu
if i was a Food critic i would call it innovitave, but i'm not, so make up your own mind
the Food is alwaysgood value for money, extremely P_F_FI_Taste/tasty and quick to arrive
now for the A_Plc_Bar side of things
firstly, its expensive - even the special deals on things like cocktails are on the dearer side
its always empty too, meanin S_Staff just seem to hang about
the A_Plc_Bar area has seats and tables which are far too low and uncomfortable to enjoy your S_Del_Time here, and the booths are pretty cramped, but so isolated you cant split your party across two for fear of never seeing your friends again
as i said, great Food, poor A_Plc_Bar
okay, the Restaurant is no frills, simple, would almost qualify for triple d
except, it F_FI_Taste good
we've been to a few triple d joints and most have been P_O_Experience/disappointing, making me wonder how much they pay to grab guy's attention and the publicity
F_FI_Taste of louisiana brings it!!!!  F_FI_Taste, F_FI_Taste, smell, appearance, and Food
all good
what would make them great?  one thing
liquor license
so i could have a F_Drinks with my fab fish!glad i grabbed the 'go' box because i had serious craving the next day
it reheated perfectly and i learned that the F_FI_Taste was really the ingredients and not over saturation of grease
momma loved her gumbo and appreciated that Restaurant were not huge slimy chunks of okra in it
the hibernate man and i had oysters, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
all worthy of S_Delivery again and again and again
i P_O_Experience/enjoyed the tater salad but we both thought the dirty rice could have used more F_FoodItem in much, much larger pieces
as it was the F_FoodItem was so minimal and P_F_FI_Size/small it could not be F_FI_Taste even though i could see it
that, and the lack of F_Drinks, were the only down sides to our kickin' lous-e-anna O_Experience!

P_A_Env_Type/fun A_Environment
i agree with the other reviews
don't go here for the Food, it's nothing bad, Restaurant's just better mexican Food
the drinks, the prices, and the Ambience make it a nice Restaurant to be though
what a great find!   this mexican Restaurant is located next to the ultrastar movie theatre at wadell and litchfield road in surprise
from the outside, you can't tell that it is a really nice, roomy, Restaurant on the inside
it is a sit down mexican Restaurant with all you can eat chips and F_FoodItem
(before we went Restaurant the first S_Del_Time, i thought Restaurant was just a P_A_Env_Size/small fast-food Restaurant, but i was wrong - Restaurant is a P_A_Env_Size/big, full-service Restaurant
)  they have very reasonable prices, great Food and a great Ambience
how can you go wrong?

Restaurant is a P_A_Env_Size/small, family-operated diner right on brownsville road across from the whitehall plaza
they are open for Food and Food
the S_Staff is very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and Food is good
the jt omelet is my favorite
the fare on the tv is rather mind-numbing and the syrup is just corn syrup, but they are generally quite busy, so many customer don't count these major issues
i love it here!! try it and you'll be P_O_Experience/satisfied
left zarkana and decided to grab a bite
talked my spouse into trying this Restaurant and boy am i glad i did
the ceiling is like watching a school of F_FoodItem passing over
the S_Staff was remarkable in S_Staff P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentiveness and P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledge- this seems to be less important to many of the venues i have sampled during this week in town
i P_O_Experience/enjoyed the deconstructs thoroughly
my biggest issue was trying to narrow the S_Menu down to a single choice
i'm not gonna lie, they had me at the corn muffins
a great O_Experience!

came here on my last visit to las vegas after finding a coupon online
immediately after walking in i sensed chaos
the S_Staff could not keep track of people walking in as she kept walking away from her stand
people starting getting angry and she just didn't want to deal with it
finally got seated, but the waitstaff, just like the S_Staff seemed to show much indifference to our presence
finally after being served our Food
it really was just eh
i think the olive garden (i am not really a fan either) F_FI_Taste better
my broccoli/cavatelli was swimming in garlic/oil
i didn't even want the left overs
won't be returning
i live in summerlin so this Restaurant is a little out of the way but way W_Price the trip
the pablano stuffed with shrimp is so damn good! i wanted to take a whole other one home to eat later
the F_FoodItem's here are authentic and have just the right kick
gustavo is an absolute gentleman and makes you feel like you are eating at his home
food lion strip mall chinese Food, also offers deliver
O_Experience had always been good and Food is exactly as you'd expect
i recently went to this establishment for Foodi have been here before but decided to give them another go since their remodel S_Menu expansion
the Service was slow at best
they weren't very busy, may have been understaffed
i imagine they don't pay well as the wait staff didn't seem interested
i S_Delivery their signature "vinny's F_FoodItem F_FoodItem" medium-well, with a side of french fries
the F_FoodItem came P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked and P_F_FI_Quality/dry
the F_FoodItem, also P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked
they advertise fresh-cut F_FoodItem, but my S_Delivery had a very dark appearance and will small in length
i'm sure this Restaurant does great bottle/six-pack business due to their large selection
they may want to reconsider items on their S_Menu or better yet, give up Food all together
great S_Menu, lots of items to choose from! however, if its friday- get the F_FoodItem fry! do it and thank me later
they also offer tater tots on the side, which is kind of my favorite thing ever
watson road is one of the last stops on the west side of buckeye while heading towards california so i knew i should stop for a bite to eat (or wait over an hour til the next town)
i saw the signs for a cracker barrel and my memories of a good 'ol P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot country Food sounded real good
when i got inside and realized how packed the Restaurant was, i decided to S_Delivery the Food to go
so, based purely on what i could eat while driving, i had to say no to the biscuits and gravy i so love or their fluffy pancakes
i narrowed it down to handheld Food; F_FoodItem
almost went with their F_FoodItem or P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem, but ended up with the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (hoping for a lil bit of comfort with each bite)
the sourdough F_FoodItem (which had some sort of glaze) was really good, but it wasn't P_F_FI_CookingLevel/toasted so the F_FoodItem started to make the F_FoodItem soggy
and their F_FoodItem wasn't P_F_FI_Size/thick and generous like i've had at bj's or other Restaurant
and because it wasn't made too firm, it kept falling out of the F_FoodItem and onto my shirt (lucky, no car accidents)
the store had neat stuff (bought a cow mug that had utters) to browse while waiting for my Food and the S_Staff (thanks jenifer) were great
but if you want to eat and enjoy their Food, don't get it to go
my biggest mistake
this Restaurant is great!stick with the F_FoodItem
we tried the sausage plate and hot dog and neither were that exciting
i love the duck and pork belly baos
i would have liked to try the short rib one but they told me they took it off the S_Menu
the banh mi F_FoodItem was also very good
i would love to give this Restaurant 5 starts bu the Ambience is not great for people staying on the strip--about $20 cab each way from mandalay, which basically doubles the price of anything on the S_Menu
5starts is you have your own ride but not W_Price the cab ride
please open a Ambience on the strip!  please!!

when staying at caesar's palace, this is one of the more affordable and familiar Restaurant to munch at
whether it's a P_F_FI_Size/large Food of F_FoodItem or refined F_FoodItem tacos, the Food is decent in terms of F_FI_Taste and price given it's in vegas
i'd S_Delivery the sweet potato F_FoodItem on the side
service is fast and friendly
the Ambience is a bit bare with cramped seating in small tables next to gambling tables with smoke
parking is ample in the hotel's garage
i guess you'll all have to count me as part of this "vocal minority" who are critical of this Restaurant, it has joined a long list of F_FoodItem Restaurant in the south west of las vegas which i won't be visiting a second S_Del_Time
perhaps it depends on who you get that influences your perception of customer Service, but my O_Experience as a walk-in customer was one of being rushed into my decision so the proprietor could get on with more important things
the F_FoodItem was edible, but with a very bland crust and unevenly cooked
F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Taste/tasty but are beyond greasy
an uncomfortable S_Delivery O_Experience that paid off with blah-tasting Food
do not go in this Restaurant!! i made a yelp account just to write this review for this horrid Restaurant
i never knew i could get the worst possible Service ever, especially in las vegas
if you're thinking bout eating in here, turn around and go to pinks just outside or lobster me next to fat tuesday
i ate here with my friends friday 2/10/12 for Food and we were sure in for a Service
we got seated right away and asked for orange juices all around
5 minutes later someone comes to take our S_Delivery: 2 classic Food, sausage biscuits, bucket of wings, steak & eggs, and Food skins (potato skins)
waiter comes back with waters all around, still no orange juice
15 min later
bucket of wings come out; pretty good, not the best but still somewhat satisfying
(still no orange juice)20 minutes have gone by no orange juice and still no Food at our table
we're getting restless and impatient
since no one bothered to ask us for refills we asked one of the S_Staff passing by to see if our Food was ready
another 5 minutes later, our Food has arrived
classic Food - eggs were cold
not hot
not P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm
cold
tater tots cold
bacon was the only thing even close to warm
sausage biscuits - you can tell by the look of congealed formation of skin on the gravy on the biscuits that it was only possible to achieve this look from sitting around too long
not to mention that the biscuits were getting harder by the second
hopefully they think twice before putting their biscuits in the microwave
Food skins - looks nice
no sour cream?? potato skins were not even baked long enough, no crisp whatsoever
steak & eggs - asked for medium rare, came out well done
after all our Food was delivered, we had to ask for our orange juices
we couldn't even finish our Food because of the low F_FI_Quality of Food and Service
i don't understand how you can eat at a Restaurant and not even get asked "how's everything tasting?" "would you like refills?" "everything come out ok?" not once
after we asked for the check the busboy had was cleaning the table, literally everything while we were still sitting down
picking up silverware, napkins, dishes, and even wiping it down while we were trying to pay
couldn't it have waited till after we left? i would never P_O_Experience/come_back to this god-forsaken Restaurant
worst F_FI_Quality of Food
worst possible customer Service
worst lack of integrity for a Restaurant
save yourself the S_Del_Time and eat at pinks 2 min away or F_FoodItem me down the walkway, you won't regret it
Restaurant is a P_A_Env_Type/fun A_Environment!  i have only really gone to drink, they have some great specials and a P_A_Env_Type/fun patio
the Food is typical A_Plc_Bar Food
nothing to write home about
sports fans, they have flat screens everywhere, all over the A_Plc_Patio as well
a P_A_Env_Type/fun A_Environment to go out with friends on a sat night as well as a P_A_Env_Type/fun A_Environment to day drink on the A_Plc_Patio  i'm a fan

my pregnant sister was craving F_FoodItem for the longest & 1 of our friends told us about this Restaurant so we decided to check it out after Food
as i came in, i smelled something wonderful & sweet
even though i was kind of full from eating at montesano's italian eateria nearby, my stomach got excited again & my mouth started watering w/ the aroma
i got such a bad sweet tooth
the Restaurant was so clean & had that cute modern look
very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff
very reasonably priced
Restaurant were so many options on the S_Menu
everything sounded good
we ended w/ the cookie monster, banana foster & the elvis F_FoodItem w/ vanilla ice cream
amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the cookie monster was my favorite
it was like eating that half P_F_FI_CookingLevel/baked F_FoodItem by ben & jerry's but 100x's better
omfg! i seriously want to P_O_Experience/come_back again today
i'm in love
it's my first S_Del_Time having a F_FoodItem in shape of a cone w/ ice cream
i can't believe i've been missing out all this S_Del_Time
so thankful for my sister's pregnancy cravings
next S_Del_Time i'm going to try either the rebel or tickle me berry w/ the green F_Drinks ice cream
the maui fever sounds good too
i'm so excited for my next visit!

the first S_Del_Time i came here was with a bachelor party
we were sitting in the lounge area by the A_Plc_Bar doing some drinking, and unbeknownst to us, the S_Staff here are scantily clad, sporting massive jugs
i'll get to the Food in a second
so we're sitting down and the S_Staff is right behind my friend zach
she says, "would you guys like any drinks?" zach swiveled around to answer and accidentally got a face full of 36 f's
like, an unintentional motorboat
great life moment
also, the little S_Staff with the tongue ring is highly attractive in that librarian kind of way, and you know she also owns thigh high boots
na'mean? i'd shake those F_FoodItem
i'd let her hold my stein
with my eyes open and the lights on
mmmmhmmm darlin'
the shakes
the shakes are insanity in a glass
i S_Delivery a compost shake and immediately wanted to vomit
i mean that in the best way possible
think of like - an excitement induced vomit
like when you get married or something
actually, that's probably not the best analogy
what i'm trying to say is the F_FoodItem are incredibly rich and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, and i would P_O_Experience/recommend the compost shake to anyone who was punishing themselves with tastiness
the F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem i ate was so P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, Restaurant are no words to describe it
the best way to describe it would be to make a series of guttural noises and then pass out face down into a pile of puppies
i hadn't had anything like the kobe F_FoodItem in a long S_Del_Time, and it's just what i wanted
my pants also wanted it, because i came home with the bad kind of stained pants
messy burger
two other things that stood out for me were the awesome art adorning the walls, and my S_Staff's enormous handlebar mustache
good on you, mate!

i doubt it's still a secret as to how to find this joint, but just in case someone needs a tip: Restaurant's a hallway on the third floor of the cosmopolitan between blue ribbon and jaleo
if you're coming up the escalators, it'll be almost directly in front of you
i've had their F_FoodItem a handful of S_Del_Time and have always P_O_Experience/enjoyed it
today was no exception
i went with something simple: their white pie (F_FoodItem sauce and healthy chunks of ricotta cheese) with sundried tomatoes
deeee-licious! their crust is fantastic (love thin crust)
now, it's not my absolute favorite white sauce, but it's still damn good
and if you're not a white sauce fan, their red sauce is fabulous too
also, if you're not on the go or in a hurry, get the whole pie and take it home! worth the savings (a slice of white pie is $5 compared to a whole white pie for $30)
oh, but pass on the fountain drink though; it's a red solo cup for four bucks
yikes
i am picky, let that be known
park brugges satisfies my endless craving for mussels much in the same way its sister Restaurant does
situated in the charming business district of highland park, park brugges is a great Restaurant to spend a romantic evening, or get your grub on after work
roll up those sleeves because moule's can get a bit messy at S_Del_Time if you dive into them with a zeal such as mine
i imagine they have other fantastic dishes on their S_Menu, i am sure of it
alas, i doubt i will ever discover it for myself as i am too busy getting lost in a sea of curried moules and crispy frites (mayo!), while the current of unibroue carries me onward
came back to la petite france twice after my initial visit, and both S_Del_Time were for F_FoodItem
i'm giving it one more star just for the P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem and F_Dessert F_FoodItem!  although Service is consistently slow (compare to many other Restaurant), i kinda respect it now that they are french, and why rush when you have the S_Del_Time to enjoy a nice Food :) so if you are busy with a limited S_Del_Time for a Food, just don't even bother to come!

meh
zoe's is special for not fearing the americanized F_FI_Taste bud
i don't mean the Food is super exotic
i mean that they don't serve deceitful Food just because it's popular
many a "healthy" Restaurant is so scared of people complaining about F_FI_Taste that they hide absurd F_FI_Size of F_Ingredients, fat, and salt in their dishes, just to avoid losing clients that probably shouldn't be Restaurant anyway
the rest of us end up with an entree that appears greener and more nutritious, but is actually just brimming with the same problem ingredients as the F_FoodItem everyone secretly wanted
not at zoe's
sure, not every dish is "healthy", but the S_Menu is pleasantly accommodating to any diet
they replaced every one of the original sides that came with my kebabs in exchange for a heap of veggies without hesitation
you can pretty much build your own dish, and for people avoiding gluten, dairy, obesity, this, that, and the other
that's pretty cool
the F_FoodItem is cooked simply, nothing is drowned in sauce, and they don't skimp on the greenery
plus, calories and nutrition facts are all available if you're feeling neurotic
kudos to zoe's, because even if my veggies would have F_FI_Taste better soaked in cheese, my stomach thanks you
time for another update and it is still holding 4 stars!this will remain one of my favorites and moving to the other side of town sucks for a go to Restaurant for me like this
i will drive over here for my hand made noodles, i guess because i have become spoiled!  the  lan zhou beef noodle soup is my goto F_FI_Taste and this S_Del_Time we splurged on calories and had the spicy wonton F_Appetizer with chili sauce
oommgg yes a double omg good love this stuff
would S_Delivery every S_Del_Time but my waist will not allow that
*grumble* the hibernate S_Staff is back home visiting so the Service is not quite to par but i won't fault them for that because it is temporary Service
food awesome as always and gesh i feel like i am saying good by :( a 30 minute drive will happen here and Restaurant but not as much as i would like
love the Food and highly P_O_Experience/recommend it
don't judge a book by its cover, considering this is in papago plaza
mikas greek is very nice inside, with a modern twist
the Food is always P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and the customer Service is on point
this Restaurant opened in the same spot as village pizza, which had closed several months ago
i was hoping that they would have gotten rid of the bad F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste when they cleaned and redid the A_Decori think this new tenant has what it takes to stick around
it's basically a mom and pop version of cici's
i was greeted by a friendly face at the counter where i had an option to purchase the buffet or a la carte
i had come for the buffet, so the buffet it was
the Food buffet was $5
49
i grabbed my beverage cup and found a table
the buffet featured salad, F_FoodItem, and two types of F_FoodItemi can only speak to the F_FoodItem here because i ignored the salad and F_FoodItem
i can tell you that the salad A_Plc_Bar appeared to be your average F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar featuring romaine, and the F_FoodItem served was penne and spaghetti
the F_FoodItem was decent
nothing outstanding, but i wasn't paying for outstanding
Restaurant were several different varieties of F_FoodItem available and the S_Staff even took requests
i asked if they had a buffalo F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, and they said sure!  ten minutes later, the F_FoodItem was out
the S_Staff calls out the pizza-type as they're put on the A_Plc_Bar
that is extremely helpful in getting the F_FoodItem you want
it's styrofoam plates and cups, so nothing fancy
but the F_FoodItem is decent and the Service is outstanding
i'll P_O_Experience/be_back!

an authentic Restaurant for meditation Food, F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
i have tried greek salad, F_FoodItem and lambs shawarma with yellow rice
all F_FoodItem are really P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
worth it to try on weekdays Food too,the last don't  forget to try "baklva " F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/yummy too
yes indeed i am a fan of le thai
i find myself finding ways to be near le thai on east fremont downtown, just in case i get hungry
i love this little thai spot
it's definitely a more fused-up style of thai cooking, hence the 'le' :] but i love everything about it
i have never dined anywhere other than on the back A_Plc_Patio under the mist sprayers, and even in 100+ degree heat, it is really comfortable back Restaurant
with all the items you would expect from a thai S_Menu - like pad thai and panag curry, F_FoodItem also incorporates some other P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FI_Taste
my personal favorite is the spicy eggplant with shrimp
F_FoodItem
really
P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
the only thing that i find is difficult for me to grasp is they're spicy seasonings
i can handle, and do enjoy some heat in my asian-style favorites, but the spice is often not consistent at le thai
i usually get a '4' out '5' when they ask for a preference in spice level
sometimes it's perfect, and someS_Del_Time F_FoodItem not P_F_FI_Taste/spicy at all, and then other times i can't even eat it it's so hot
i have been told that they use 'ghost pepper' (look it up
its a really P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot F_FoodItem,) on the hotter end of the scale
this may be why it's sometimes hard to handle
the remedy for me, has been to S_Delivery a level 3 and spice it up with the F_FoodItem and chili sauce they bring to the table
then it's perfect for me every S_Del_Time
if you haven't tried it, and love thai food
i think you will be very happy with le thai
Food is P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and the S_Staff is great and the prices are right
see you Restaurant!

stopped in for Food to go
no greeting while i stood at the counter waiting to S_Delivery and two S_Staff looked at me
S_Delivery F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem were ok but they were dripping in grease
the F_FoodItem was very tender but lacking in F_FI_Taste
i loaded it with S_Staff special sauce and it was much better
the carolina sauce F_FI_Taste like french's mustard with paprika and a little bit of onions
it made for good sauce to dip my F_FoodItem
all things considered i would give them a b-

poor customer service!! first S_Del_Time Restaurant i asked if the sauce was smooth and it was
the P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem was great, very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
second S_Del_Time on a P_F_FI_Size/large F_FoodItem, sauce was chunky, and my reviews show, i hate chunky F_FoodItem sauce! (i know i'm fussy, but that's the way it is) last monday 2/20 we went again for a P_F_FI_Size/large F_FoodItem
i asked the S_Staff if they could put smooth sauce on our F_FoodItem, like straining it or removing the chunks
she checked with the kitchen and told me "that's the way the sauce is" meaning take it or leave it
to me, it wouldn't have been a big thing to take a minute to remove the tomato chunks before baking my F_FoodItem to keep a customer coming back
so, since they didn't take care of my needs, i will never P_O_Experience/go_back Restaurant and i'm using yelp to vent my displeasure with this Restaurant
to the S_Staff: take care of the customers, or they won't come back
note 3/4/2012-lori from demarco's contacted me offering to "be our guest so we can make you happy"
a nice gesture, but i don't care now
i don't want a free F_FoodItem
we'll spend our yearly $1500-$2000 on F_FoodItem someplace else
my husband and i are Foodies in the sense that we love food and particularly enjoy 1
farm-to-fork establishments even more so if 2
they are inventive
i'll give this Restaurant inventive
i had a bacon-infused cocktail that was shaken with a whole egg
now, i love inventive cocktails
i consider myself somewhat of a cocktail connoiseur (hands down best cocktails ever = santaella in puerto rico)
this eggy, bacon concoction was just weird, though
on to the hibernate course
my husband had the heritage farm F_FoodItem breast & california chorizo sausage
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/yummy
but the F_FoodItem was so (so, so!) very dry!! so much so, he requested more sauce to help make it palitable (if Restaurant had been a P_A_Env_Size/larger Restaurant, we'd have sent the dish back
we didn't want to hurt their bottom line)
i S_Delivery the king salmon
i love king salmon -- i've prepared it many S_Del_Time
the plate was $34 -- not outrageous for king salmon
and it would have been a steal if it was good
but sadly it was mushy
the table next to us sat three couples -- each of the wives S_Delivery this dish and i noticed not one ate even half
again, if this hadn't been a mom and pop operation, the F_FoodItem would have gone back
the Restaurant is cute and rustic
although the tables and chairs feel like they'd be better suited for a diner
our S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive
we came to pittsburgh for a foodie weekend
and had anticipated that this would be the pinnacle
we left, unfortunately, feeling like our S_Del_Time (and money) would have been better spent elsewhere
nandos was by far my favorite chain Restaurant in europe
the butterfly F_FoodItem was amazing, as i had one in the london, dublin, and edinburgh Ambience
a must have if visiting!

in the never-ending burger wars here in las vegas, bachi burger continues to be one of the best for me!they have an asian fusion thing going on that is amazing! don't worry
you traditionalists can still get a basic cheese burger
and it will be amazing too!a few highlights - the F_FoodItem are really interesting
i like the the s&p garlic F_FoodItem, and my partner likes the truffle F_FoodItem with drizzle
check them out
also the pork belly F_FoodItem are awesome too! they make a great starter!

pretty much the best doughnut i've eaten, ever
i am no connoisseur, despite the overly descriptive detail that will follow, but have had my fair share of donuts over the years and was admittedly P_O_Experience/impressed to find that it is in fact possible to make a version that F_FI_Taste noticeably different than any other
we S_Delivery a F_Ingredients twist, a buttermilk, a seemingly simple glaze, and thai F_Drinks
i bit into the F_Ingredients twist first as it tends to be a fave and noticed immediately that Restaurant was a slight crisp to it that i had never experienced
the F_FoodItem was pretty much just a P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem F_FoodItem had been P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried twice over in F_Ingredients
so bad, yet so very good
the glaze, which is usually my least favorite kind, ended up the real show stopper
it was like a flaky layered croissant consistency, but with that same oh-so- slight outer crisp that accompanied the rest
just pure evil really
the thai F_Drinks wasn't my favorite (a little too syrup-y), but the outdoor seating was a bonus, the Service was good, and at just under $5 the price was right
i'm a fan and will be trying my hardest not to come back soon
we had a really good O_Experience at stone
i'd say Restaurant are literally only two downsides
the first is S_Parking, and the second is a Restaurant layout issue, though not a real problem for our visit during a slower S_Del_Time
the former is what it is
you're not likely to get a spot that's close to the Restaurant, but that can be said for most downtown Restaurant
the latter issue is simply where the robust wall S_Menu is located in relation to where we S_Delivery
still not a huge issue
unless it's packed
then i could see it being tough to S_Delivery from
i liked how the idea was setup, though
you pick your crust, your sauce, your topping, etc
it's a fully customizable O_Experience, and it's reasonably-priced
i got the caprese salad, which was good, and i like the lack of pretentiousness with everything served on F_FoodItem trays, a la fiori's style
the F_FoodItem was perfectly cooked
a lot of these neapolitan F_FoodItem Restaurant that are popping up struggle to cook the center of the F_FoodItem so it's not soggy without overcooking the outside of the crust
our F_FoodItem were perfectly done, though! we kept it simple on our visit, but overall the nice Service, fair F_FI_Price, and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem make stone a Restaurant W_Price checking out if you're downtown and have a craving for F_FoodItem that won't leave you feeling miserably full of grease
the S_Staff (i'm assuming based on his interaction with guests while making F_FoodItem) was really nice and outgoing, and you could tell he was really interested in what people thought
that mentality will help stone stick around
i just worry about Ambience
great thai Food
my wife and i will P_O_Experience/be_back for sure
she said she loved the curry and egg rolls
whipped over here and P_O_Experience/enjoyed a Food outing today with mark r
& robyn n
it's a simply decorated mid-sized Restaurant with a friendly host and reasonable prices
the S_Menu though, in my opinion, is a disaster case; very hard to follow and S_Delivery from
that's my big complaint about this restaurant
once i managed to S_Delivery a couple of things, i went with a street style asada taco ($1
30), and a plate of three quesadillas, one with P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem, one with beef, cheese and mushrooms, and one with marinated pork
($6)
all three were covered with shredded lettuce and bits of cheese, and Restaurant was a nice sauce floating around on the plate underneath
the serving of chips for the three of us was dinky (even though we were brought a few more later), & they were paper thin
the rest of the Food was very good, so it's a high 3 stars overall for this nice Restaurant
:-)(cash only
)

"another F_FoodItem Restaurant" was what i was thinking before going to burgr
nowadays, everywhere you go Restaurant is a "gourmet" F_FoodItem
but, this Restaurant is different
just from walking in, Restaurant is a warmth here
i couldn't help but watch the S_Staff, and how P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff was
this is for sure a rareity recently in vegas, as everyone only seems out for a tip
i have to mention my S_Staff (karlenda) by name, because i was floored by her
if i was opening a Restaurant tomorrow, i would be trying to steal her away
not only was S_Staff P_S_Stf_Behavior/personable, but she had a perfect S_Stf_Experience of the S_Menu, and knew every question we could throw at her
she seemed honestly happy to be Restaurant, and to be working
she made the O_Experience shine before we even got the Food
as for the Food, we started with the F_FoodItem and soba noodle salad, which was so good we were fighting over the last bite as they were trying to clear the plate
the thing that P_O_Experience/impressed me the most was the range of F_FoodItem
of course, Restaurant is the "boring-middle-of-the-road" plain F_FoodItem (which i have nothing against, but i want adventure when i have a F_FoodItem out somewhere
so many of the F_FoodItem sound good, but i could not stop wondering about the F_FoodItem with the mango chutney, and so i had to S_Delivery it
we also had the spicy hot dog and goat cheese F_FoodItem at the table as well
all i can say about the F_FoodItem is that Restaurant was not a bite left on the table
they were amazing
i couldn't believe i P_O_Experience/enjoyed them so much
as for the hot dog, i am not normally a hot dog person, but F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/spicy, P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, i couldn't believe it
i had under-estimated this Restaurant assuming it was going to be ok Food relying on a celebrity name (which happens, sadly)
for F_Dessert i had the banana shake with butterscotch pudding on top
i let my friends at the table have one small sip, and the rest was mine
this Food was not only great, but one amazing exprience i can't stop telling people about
i can't stop thinking about those F_FoodItem, and i am looking forward to heading back over Restaurant soon!

still too date my first ramen O_Experience in vegas was at monta ramen so going too monta chaya brought back found memories
i hardly go too monta not out of dislike just not someone generally likes too wait
when you have ramen sora right down the road not as busy and just as good if not better
few and far between see monta
monta chaya brought back all the things i first love about getting me some ramen just like back home in da islands
the shoyu ramen broth love it! i love the depth of F_FI_Taste and the noodles are awesome
the gyoza now that is something sorely miss
by far all the ramen Restaurant in town been too few but truthfully not all
monta gyoza is league by itself
i think its cooked too right on and the filling had so much F_FI_Taste
i also had the kim chee fred rice as side
it was ono
just had right balance with the kim chee not spicy at all but well rounded with the vegetables and the sauce
i am just happy that vegas is blessed too add another great ramen Restaurant in town
now with so many Ambience not part of town in that find some good ramen
the biggest bonus about this Ambience and if ever need my monta fix for sure this is Ambience i would go before the original
the Food is the same at both Ambience
just so much nicer at monta chaya for obvious reason its brand new, lot more spacious seating from tables too seating at the A_Plc_Bar, and like the A_Decor inside very much modern asian theme
the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly especially since went with my asian persuasian crew five of us in all
they did great job of staying on top of our drinks and everything coming out in timing matter
so if in the area need your ramen fix monta chaya is Restaurant too get some!!!

the Food was not good! the F_FoodItem had a F_FoodItem texture
the cajun F_FI_Taste was say to spicy
the Service over all was ok
and the rice was good
this Restaurant is P_O_Exp_StarsByCus/overrated
ok, folks this Restaurant is a true hidden gem
inside the old gold spike, is a great Restaurant for Food and Food
prices are good, Food is great,  Ambience is comfortable
S_Staff  are P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and a kick in the pants
i wish i could give 4
5 stars
overall, it was a pretty good O_Experience
here's how i rate everythingFood (#19 pho)-8/10
great F_FI_Taste, good Food size for price
my only real complaint here is that the beef was a little fatty and wasn't sliced really thin
i've always liked when Restaurant serve the beef in pho paper thin-even if that means i get less beef
the S_Menu lists one size foe $6
95, it's pretty big
you can apparently also S_Delivery an xl serving, but i did not ask the price
drink (thai iced F_Drinks)- 5/10
ok
i've had much better
$2
50
probably won't get this again
service- 10/10- i walked up to the door carrying my son in a car seat, the S_Staff working Restaurant opened the door and welcomed me with a smile, lead me to a table and grabbed me a high chair
he even put the car seat into the high chair and made sure it was secure before signaling my S_Staff
she was also great! she must have noticed me struggling with the chop sticks, because she brought me out a fork, then a glass of water when my F_Drinks was half gone
i asked for neither but appreciated both
top Ambience: 7/10: i lump these two together because i tend to care more about the later, but i know some people put a lot of value in Ambience
it is a pretty P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant, i think only 7 tables or so
Ambience is nothing special, but you are brought you drinks, unlike my usual pho Restaurant, Restaurant is a P_A_Env_Size/small nicety
i will definitely be going here again
love it
the winneburger (truck edition) is a delightfully sharp attempt to serve american classics (cheeseburgers, in particular) without relying on going overboard with size and toppings
so sharp, in fact, that all i'm going to talk about is the burger
P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem? check
two patties, bacon, cheese? it's all Restaurant
and yet it's one of the quickest Food truck eats; a perfect lead-up before you reach for something adventurous
it's everything you want out of a F_FoodItem fest with half the work
the flip-side, of course, is that if you want to be filled you'll want two
but i say this is F_FoodItem tapas - meant to be gobbled and savored as you wait out the lineup at a truck or F_Drinks shop
$6
50 all day S_Menu! great thai Food
the red curry was the best i have had on this side of town
on par with archie's!

we ate at texas roadhouse for Food last night
our S_Staff was a S_Staff with a great P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff wish i had gotten his name
we truly P_O_Experience/enjoyed him
i S_Delivery the prime rib and it was super tough i told him this and he took care of it promptly also sent the S_Staff over
we  S_Delivery a steak instead which came out with two more sides it was excellent
my party of four really  P_O_Experience/enjoyed our Food and appreciated the swift fix of mistakes
so koi seems out of Restaurant in arrowhead fountains
i mean the center it's in definitely needs a F_FoodItem Restaurant and i am glad koi is Restaurant, but koi seems more strip mall-y/dive-y than anything
they have a lot of rolls to choose from (at least 50, one named for each state)
we S_Delivery the dumplings and two rolls
i am pretty sure one of the rolls was wrong, but we really liked it so we didn't say anything
the Food was good, P_F_FI_Price/inexpensive
the Service was just ok
it's definitely a Restaurant i would come back to after a movie, but not a Restaurant i would go out of the way to eat at
while staying at the queen elizabeth last week, concierge P_O_Experience/recommended this Restaurant to us
it was waking distance from our hotel and seemed to have a good vibe upon entering
a fabulous S_Staff seated us upstairs near the open kitchen area
we asked the S_Staff for Food recommendations and while none of us were eating red F_FoodItem at the S_Del_Time and made that clear, he continued to say that it was a steakhouse and that was the only thing W_Price on the S_Menu
it was disconcerting that he couldn't be positive about the F_FoodItem grilled cheese or P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
we then opted to just get a few F_Appetizer, which were good
the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
we shared a P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_FoodItem which was outstanding
F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and came with F_FoodItem and shoestrings F_FoodItem
highly P_O_Experience/recommend this dish if you go and don't want steak
also, the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Size/huge and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
a great plate to share
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasteless, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked and made from bad F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem in the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Quality/dry and P_F_FI_Taste/tasteless
the F_Drinks was served in a can and we had to pay for the F_FoodItem that were left on our table when we returned our Food
truly a bad O_Experience
went with a galpal for Food not long ago
the A_Environment was, well, it was like a glorified A_Entertainment A_Plc_Bar
the A_Ent_Music was loud, but upbeat and it was packed with college age kids watching a A_Entertainment
the A_Ent_Tv are nice, but it's not my S_Menu A_LocatedArea for watching anything long
Food was ok, F_FoodItem aren't bad
the Food took so long to come out that our S_Staff, who was a P_S_Stf_Behavior/riot, came to our A_Fur_Table and looked at us and says, deadpan, i'm going in Restaurant to make your Food
i'll be right back
five or so S_Del_Time later he's got a F_Ingredients stain on his shirt and Food in his hand
i don't know if S_Staff actually made them or not, but i got a kick out of that
i give it an a-ok for a Food time hangout but all around i'm pretty underwhelmed by it
i can't believe this gem has no reviews
i stopped by america's F_FoodItem Restaurant the other night expecting something similar to what i get at el rinconcito
no comparison whatsoever
the carne asada F_FoodItem Restaurant are far superior and much for sizeable
sure the Restaurant isn't nearly as A_Decor, but the Food is excellent
the S_Staff are P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly but you will likely need to brush up on your spanish before you go
i love this Restaurant
great Service & great Food! brought a group of 13, 5 being small children
S_Staff was so P_S_Stf_Behavior/kind!!!
good sign when the crowd includes policemen, firemen, business and more importantly locals
another good sign when my 3 and 4 year old make me S_Del_Time in S_Del_OrderingMethod not one extra S_Del_Time but two S_Del_Time so that they could get thirds
4 O_Exp_StarsByCus just because how could i give F_FoodItem bell 5??to start, i am biased towards Food F_FoodItem in a Food
i love Food
put F_FoodItem or F_Dessert in a Food, and it is just that much better
short of the extreme of the F_FoodItem time A_Ent_Tv A_Decor (google it), F_FoodItem my Food in a Food to go!ok, as for F_FoodItem bell, for the most part you know what you are going to get
while i have had a few 7-layer F_FoodItem that were "off" in the past, for the most part, Restaurant is little surprise
i just want to commend this particular A_LocatedArea because it is probably the busiest F_FoodItem bell i have ever seen
any day m-f and this Restaurant is a mad house at Food time
thankfully, they are super fast on servicing both the "Restaurant" and "S_Del_OrderingMethod" S_Delivery
that's it
4 starts for a F_FoodItem bell that S_Delivery the highest F_FI_Quality of F_FoodItem Food mexican at the fastest Restaurant!
just tried this F_FoodItem for the first time
although i have lived in the neighborhood 7 yrs
the A_Decor they have on their brochure depicts a nicely browned and bubbly F_FoodItem reflecting lots of F_FoodItem that actually looked like F_FoodItem
unfortunately the actual F_FoodItem looks absolutely nothing like the A_Decor
i S_Delivery a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and Restaurant was 2 slices that had 2  pieces of F_Ingredients and the rest  had one little F_Ingredients on each slice
the F_FoodItem is very doughy
the F_Ingredients are sparse and the F_FoodItem is a paper P_F_FI_Size/thin layer that resembles a dominoes or papa john type
in essence
for F_FI_Price appox for a 1 F_Ingredients F_FoodItem it will do when you just crave F_FoodItem and have little funds
remember
you get what you O_Payment for!   i do have to compliment S_Staff on the quaint eating A_Places
just a few A_Fur_Table but very A_Environment feeling
very nice S_Staff
i am not sure if i will try it again
good Food
decent F_Drinks selection
over F_FI_Price
keeping this short and sweet:  the Food Restaurant tastes like the Food you get in thailand
authentic enough for you phoenix?
this was our second time having china rainbow, and i can officially say that i am a fan
i decided we would try this Restaurant because it has two unusual F_Ingredients for a valley S_Menu, F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients
i'm used to these at nicer Restaurant back east but not out Restaurant
my wife had the yuling F_FoodItem the first time we went and i can say it was great
a full F_FoodItem P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried in F_Ingredients and perfect with the delicious yuling F_Ingredients and i had F_FoodItem good and P_F_FI_Taste/spicy
super P_F_FI_Taste/spicy and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
i didn't care for the F_Drinks F_Ingredients in the F_FoodItem F_Appetizer otherwise it was good
tonight we got takeout and i took the plunge and got the yuling F_Ingredients and the wife got F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
the S_Menu "highly P_O_Experience/recommends" the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and for good reason, it was really good
i would S_Delivery it for myself everytime we go but i'm gonna try something new next time
i got the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_Appetizer which was a waste of money even if it was just $3 it was just P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem with no filling i was expecting actual F_Appetizer P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItems or for them to be stuffed with something
still a great Restaurant with really good and very reasonably F_FI_Price Food
drove up to wickenburg w/friends to have Food we decided to try anitas
i had the carne asada F_FoodItem w/F_FoodItem the F_FoodItem were smokey and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorfull F_FoodItem were very good as well wife had the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem good F_FI_Taste our friends Food were brought to them and the S_Staff switched them so it took our friends a few minutes to figure that out
Service was good (except for the mix up) will defenetly return they also do Food
worst F_FoodItem i've ever had! so soggy and too much F_Ingredients
i hate it when the crust is soggy!!!
i'm not sure what else to say about this Restaurant that hasn't been already said
this Restaurant is legit
S_Del_OrderingMethod are long but goes fast
F_FoodItem has always been P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh as can be when i go Restaurant
F_FoodItem is the best i have tried in the south so far
the Service was top notch also
the south for sure is very very nice and friendly and this Restaurant is no exception
this is my Restaurant to eat again when coming back to nc
they have good Food and i love their hot F_FoodItem!
"eat mo bettah!' i sure did!walk into this P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant, S_Delivery your Food from a super chill lay back S_Staff and minutes later you feel like you in new orleans
the commercial for zatarain's was playing in my mind the whole time i was eating
but so much better then the box stuff
would P_O_Experience/recommend the mardi gras combo (red F_FoodItem, jF_FoodItem & F_FoodItem creole) because most of the time i can't make up my mind
now the F_FoodItem étouffée is said to be very, very hot
so i got a half S_Delivery to play it safe
for me i've had spicier Food elsewhere
don't get me wrong it's hot put not with 2 verys
i was kinda let down by this cause i love P_F_FI_Taste/spicy Food
hotter the better
i love F_FoodItem Restaurant! their sizzling F_FoodItem Food is awesome, and you usually get enough for three Food
lots of F_FI_Religious S_Menu, and my husband loves their F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (as did i when i used to eat F_FoodItem)
ask for F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Taste/spicy -- F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Taste/delish!
if i lived in vegas, i would be Restaurant all the time
love
things to dig:its pretty
really
love the A_Decor and Ambience
Service
i am a whore for good Service
fresh
super fresh
uber fresh
yay F_FoodItem!fave apps:1
wok P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried Food and F_FoodItem- lightly P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried and golden with a sweet and P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem F_Ingredients
korabuta F_FoodItem F_FoodItem- extra special F_FoodItem not at all greasy with an awesome F_FoodItem
F_Ingredients F_FoodItem tiger F_FoodItem- shredded F_Ingredients envelops these gigantic F_FoodItem and they are laid in a F_FoodItem-F_FoodItem F_Ingredients that is out of this world
fave F_FoodItem:1
little buddha F_FoodItem- this is one of those F_FoodItem where it is a lot, but it all just goes together
the F_FoodItem is awesome and of course anytime you have spicy and sweet together i am a fan
fantasy F_FoodItem- light and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
the F_FoodItem is real and king and the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Size/thin on top
palm's F_FoodItem- killer naruto, not too P_F_FI_Taste/spicy
i am not a fan of P_F_FI_Taste/spicy Food, but S_Staff else loves the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem
and i have to admit, the only Food i have tried is the F_FoodItem :)sake S_Menu is great, they have F_FoodItem for after Food and the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem is to die for
pretty P_F_FI_Price/expensive, but this is vegas
unless you leave the strip, this is what you will O_Payment everywhere
plus, the palms is very generous with Food A_Ent_Music
get a O_Pay_Method even if you aren't playing much and you might be P_O_Experience/surprised how much you Offers your O_Payment (just give it to your S_Staff and they will take care of it)
of course, comps can't cover tip
single gripe: they don't have F_FoodItem :(
overall 3
5 O_Exp_StarsByCusgold medal - sweet F_FoodItem silver medal - unibronze medal -  F_FoodItem you are looking for F_FoodItem then F_FoodItem coma is better
if you are looking for F_FoodItem, the F_FoodItem at yama are really yum
the sweet F_FoodItem at yama is really good
it is P_F_FI_Size/large F_FoodItem and they fry the head
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and super creamy
the F_FoodItem was very P_F_FI_Taste/crispy and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
super long S_Del_Time, so try to get Restaurant early
happy sushiing!!
i love fuji
i have been coming to this Restaurant for as long as i can remember because it has been my entire life
since it is one of my grandfather's favorite Restaurants, i have been sat in a A_Furniture at fuji as well as celebrated my college graduation with friends and A_Env_Type
the S_Menu is simple, but the Food is always solid
the Service is friendly and not as slow as some other reviews P_O_Experience/suggest
and the Food is totally authentic home-style japanese
it reminds me of my grandmother's Food - a memory that  has not been invoked by any other japanese Restaurant
consistent and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, you can count on F_FoodItem to fulfill a japanese craving
every time i come Restaurant, i S_Delivery the snow white F_FoodItem
amazing
i don't know exactly all they put in Restaurant, but the special F_Ingredients that goes on it, is what makes it so amazing
i've done the ayce Restaurant for Food
F_FoodItem is a bit P_F_FI_Price/pricey and will only be Worthiness it if you're a big eater
oh, and make sure you finish everything on Restaurant, otherwise, Restaurant will O_Payment you a la carte for it
i had the F_Ingredients chops in a F_Drinks F_Ingredients F_Ingredients reduction F_Ingredients
the chose i S_Delivery medium rare
the S_Cutlery was saturated in this F_Ingredients which was incredibly over powering, too vinegary and really needed to reduce longer or use a better F_FI_Quality F_Drinks
i had this F_FI_Taste in my mouth for days
it was edible but i don't feel was executed properly and for the F_FI_Price i would expect that
when i told the S_Staff he said it's not for everyone
i explained that the issue was the F_Ingredients was over powering and if it was properly done F_FoodItem should be more sweet than F_Ingredients
the F_Ingredients chops were a little over done F_FI_CookingLevel medium well-ish and were and effort to cut
the F_FoodItem Service with it was underwhelming at best
my friend had the F_FoodItem, and it was phenomenal
i was very  very jealous of his Food and he was lovely to share with me
the F_Ingredients of the F_Appetizer was sensational, i could F_Drinks the F_Appetizer
the F_FoodItem was F_FI_Quality
we had the F_Ingredients F_Drinks, which i loved! the F_FoodItem Service at the beginning was interesting
some i liked more than others
the F_Ingredients F_Ingredients F_FoodItem i felt just had a weird F_Ingredients, and the F_FI_Taste of F_Ingredients was intense
my husband didn't seem to notice
the Ambience definitely leaves something to be desires
i feel more as if i am in some high Ambience-ed Restaurant with A_Fur_Table cloths
it's not romantic or special, more of a A_Entertainment
i think the A_Decor could have lent a little more to the A_Environment and O_Experience of enjoying the Food
again, for the F_FI_Price i have had better for less
based on my O_Experience and for the F_FI_Price this Restaurant, i would say i expected more
the F_FoodItem is what saved my O_Experience
i might try this Restaurant again if i was with a group or person who insisted on going but would not get the lamb, and most likely wouldn't seek it out again
for a chain, this Restaurant is not bad at all
dont get me wrong, i have nothing against Restaurant chains
in fact, they are pretty good sometimes because you know Restaurant is going to be consistent Ambience and you will not be in for a surprise, Restaurant is bound to be a regular Food off the S_Menu that you like and always S_Delivery and so on
we went to biaggi's for Food
after we were A_Fur_Table, a P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff came up to us and while S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/greeting us, explaining what the S_Menu of the day was, he was preparing a A_Decor of F_FoodItem oil with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem on a small S_Cutlery simultaneously (talk about multitasking
after taking our S_Delivery for F_Appetizer, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm F_FoodItem was Service
Restaurant were two types of F_FoodItem- one was a regular F_FoodItem, the other one was
i dont remember actually
my husband got a F_Appetizer - F_FoodItem F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem was extremely P_F_FI_Taste/tasty! for F_FoodItem S_Menu, i got the F_FoodItem without the F_FoodItem and my husband got the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem turned out be the best F_FoodItem i have ever had so far
with the F_Ingredients of F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem with a hint of F_FoodItem creamy F_Ingredients, this was absolutely great! and, after getting to know the fact that they were a Restaurant, i was pleasantly P_O_Experience/surprised, since the overall O_Experience of Service, Food was way beyond expectation compared to any other Restaurant
they have a good S_Menu of F_Dessert
but their F_FoodItem S_Menu is so filling that you end up taking the Food home and leave without tasting the F_Dessert
they have a good S_Menu of F_Drinks too and usually, Restaurant are suggestions available for pairing with your Food as well
when you enter the Restaurant, you will find a lot of business cards on a A_Fur_Table
these happen to be the business cards of the different S_Staff working in the A_Plc_Kitchen
i found this pretty A_Environment :)the A_Places of this Restaurant is the Food is a little over F_FI_Price
but i would highly P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant for Food Food
i love this Restaurant- the german F_Drinks and the F_FoodItem
especially the F_FoodItem- one of the P_F_FI_Taste/tastiest F_FoodItem i have ever had
Restaurant was a large A_Env_Size of us- all very A_Plc_Bar as part of a A_Environment
the S_Staff was S_Stf_Behavior with us, as vegas is all about drunken douchebags causing problems
eventually, after several nazi jokes and broken F_Drinks, we got kicked out
what was painful was that we got some S_Cutlery in the Food of the A_Fur_Table next to us, and they stuck us with part of their O_Payment
best F_FoodItem Restaurant
lived S_Staff for 5 yrs, and only indulge F_FoodItem comes even close
but still by a long shot
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem is amazing, and the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem is even to die
the most F_FI_Quality F_Ingredients around
the F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, the F_Dessert are incredible, and if you don't mind the possibility of a S_Del_Time, the S_Staff is great too
not to mention the F_Drinks S_Menu is off the hook
something for everyone
don't have a take on the F_Drinks, not a big F_Drinks connoisseur
and also not a red F_FoodItem eater, but i bring all of my out of town visitors (from the midwest
they know their F_FoodItem) and they love it! mmmmmmmmmmmm!
not much for Food just F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
good F_FoodItem but a bit P_F_FI_Price/expensive all you can eat is $ 30b
fix A_Plc_Bar and A_Places is A_LocatedArea  inside the bellagio Restaurant
i Restaurant Restaurant only because my sister was getting married at the bellagio
we had a O_Reservation for a A_Env_Type of 20, if your entire party can't make it Restaurant is a $40 O_Pay_Price per empty A_Fur_Table
our party was seperated into 3 A_Fur_Table, they have no large A_Fur_Table Restaurant
after being A_Fur_Table we where P_S_Stf_Behavior/greeted by several S_Staff, they share the A_Fur_Table
we were Service by a very mean S_Staff
S_Staff gave us total S_Stf_Behavior, forgot to take one persons S_Delivery at our A_Fur_Table
we S_Del_Time 30 mintues for our Food
while the other two A_Fur_Table ate we sat staring at each other
i spoke to the S_Staff about our Service Service and he apologized, of course
out of our three A_Fur_Table mine was the only one that added the tip to our O_Payment
so my thinking is because we didn't not S_Delivery as much F_Drinks as all the other A_Fur_Table and i spoke to the S_Staff, they then added the tip to my O_Payment to guarantee they got something out of us
my aunt told me that because vegas really has know gauranteed customer returns tRestaurant is no need to try to impress the customer
so true
i do not P_O_Experience/recommend anyone eating Restaurant at fix
the Food was P_F_FI_Price/pricey and really didn't F_FI_Taste that great
Service was horrible to say the least and if Restaurant was a O_Exp_StarsByCus that gives a 1/2 O_Exp_StarsByCus i would have choosen that
my first time! my children kept talking about this Restaurant
they are 19 years old with huge F_Appetizer and this Restaurant fits the O_Payment
i had the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem with the absolute best F_FoodItem ever as a side
my son had the monster F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem atop and F_FoodItem
it was too tall to F_Appetizer
i grazed off their S_Cutlery
can't wait to go again
well W_Price the O_Pay_Price
yum yum
F_FI_Price about what you would expect at a strip Restaurant Restaurant
we ate twice on our trip Restaurant
i had the F_FoodItem both times and the F_FI_Price on F_FoodItem was good
no kids S_Menu so both of my kids had regular S_Delivery of F_FoodItem on first Food Restaurant
they should have shared one and still would have had one F_FoodItem left over
took the Food and used them as F_Appetizer as we walked the strip
the second visit they shared a S_Cutlery
absolutely delicious
i am glad i came Restaurant early in my vacation ,so i can go Restaurant again
i had the Food F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and a F_FoodItem
i was looking at the stuffed F_FoodItem, no really i literally was staring at it, the lady probably thought i was a creeper, but i am getting that sometime this week, with a side of F_FoodItem
however, the F_FoodItem sounds good too
i did not get to stare at it to report back
sorry
whatever you do
S_Delivery those F_FoodItem!!
this Restaurant is by far the best F_FoodItem Restaurant i've ever been to!!
i love this Restaurant!!  very good Food at reasonable F_FI_Price
be prepared for a S_Del_Time with large groups and at peak times, but the Food is Worthiness it
what the hell tom colicchio?!?!?!  my blindfolded cats can make a better F_FoodItem!  i'd give it -5 O_Exp_StarsByCus but i can't
hubs and i were at the A_Places and wanted some Food
since we've been long time fans of tom on top S_Staff we thought we'd give it a try
we weren't P_O_Experience/surprised by the F_FI_Price (it is on the strip, after all) and expected the F_FoodItem to be top notch
we S_Delivery the slow P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
i should've known this was going to be a problem when i didn't see the F_FoodItem in the F_FoodItem
it said "F_FoodItem" on the S_Menu, why wasn't it on my sammie??   ehhhh, i wasn't going to walk all the way back to the A_Places from the A_Places
i thought to myself, "i can deal, i'm sure the F_FoodItem will be P_F_FI_Taste/yummy"
boy was i wrong
if you like some F_FoodItem with a sliver of F_FoodItem and a pound of F_Ingredients, this is the Restaurant for you!   i'm pretty sure the high school kid at subway can assemble a nicer F_FoodItem than this
not only were they thrown together, Restaurant was barely any stuff on the F_FoodItem
not to mention my forgotten F_FoodItem
and F_FoodItem was sooo P_F_FI_Healthy/salty!  sorely P_O_Experience/disappointed, tom
how come all the other Food you make on A_Ent_Tv looks so good?  you've really F_FI_Price in on your fame
i'd write him a note expressing my concern but i know it won't reach him and he's too busy raking in $$$ to S_Stf_Behavior
looking for a good F_FoodItem on the strip?  try earl of F_FoodItem at planet hollywood
i am across the country and cannot believe how much i miss manolo's F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem!F_FoodItem:so many S_Menu and F_FI_Religious friendly! my favorites are the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
stay away from the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, i thought it was awful
i haven't tried their F_Dessert F_FoodItem: F_Dessert and F_Dessert
the san telmo Food is okay if you want more of "F_FoodItem and F_FI_Religious" F_FI_Taste
F_FoodItem:the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_FoodItem is why i can never become F_FI_Religious! imagine a super P_F_FI_Size/thin F_FoodItem crust where F_FoodItem F_Ingredients substitutes F_FoodItem
then add F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
mmmmmm
you had me at F_FoodItem
i've also P_O_Experience/enjoyed their other specialty slices
i also have to give credit to manolo's for having great F_FoodItem
the thinness of it F_FoodItem so well in the F_FoodItem oven that you have to hold yourself back from inhaling the entire slice in five S_Del_Time
Ambience:limited A_Places A_Fur_Table and a few A_OutsideView A_Fur_Table when the weather is nice
i P_O_Experience/suggest taking your Food and sitting in the krannert A_OutsideView A_Entertainment
awesome place to eat
i come Restaurant regularly on my Food break in the Service is always friendly i P_O_Experience/recommend asking them to 'mix it up' for you once your burro is done they mix it all up before F_FoodItem it :)
very good Food!! try the fundido F_Ingredients!
don't pay attention to the snob reviewers
no, it's not the best F_FoodItem in phoenix
if you have to have the best of everything Restaurant you go then that says all we need to know about you
if Restaurant A_Env_Type,  you're going to S_Del_Time
we call that "science"
i really liked my F_FoodItem each time i have eaten Restaurant
last trip i spotted someone eating some really good looking F_FoodItem
i'll have to try those next time
come for a decent F_FoodItem,  a good Food,  interesting A_Environment and a great A_OutsideView at night
i've been coming to chloe's corner since it opened back in the day as "the counter
"  it is probably one of my favorite Restaurant in the area
it is quick, yet relaxed
and the Food is perfect
they have a plethora of F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, and everything i've tried gets my seal of approval
i usually always get the F_FoodItem along with a S_Cutlery of their F_FoodItem F_Appetizer
i don't know what it is about this P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem, because their really is nothing out of the ordinary about it, but damn they are so good
dip it in the F_FoodItem F_Appetizer and it is a bit of heaven (or your childhood
when i feel like switching it up, i'll usually get the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem is shredded and the A_Decor (F_Ingredients-soy) is so P_F_FI_Taste/delish
i usually end up S_Delivery an extra side of the A_Decor because i like it so much
if you are in the kierland/scottsdale q area for Food, do not hesitate one bit to come into chloe's corner for Food
F_FoodItem quick, affordable, and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
my O_Experience Restaurant has left me with no words
bad Service
mediocre Food
i can definitely say i'm never coming Restaurant again
it took over 20 S_Del_Time to get our A_Fur_Table some F_Drinks and the S_Staff didn't own up to S_Staff mistakes and blamed the busboy for not bringing the F_Drinks
when we got the F_Drinks, it tasted horrible
our Restaurant A_Plc_DiningRoom sink F_Drinks tastes better than that
the Food came so late as if they left to catch the F_FoodItem we were going to consume
the S_Staff then forgot to put in one of our F_FoodItem and apologized in the most stand offish way possible saying it was a "human error" as if S_Staff wasn't even sorry about it
as we received the O_Payment, my friend realized S_Staff got P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem when S_Staff had wanted F_FoodItem
all in all worst Restaurant ever! the only decent S_Staff was the busboy
avoid the S_Staff with a feather tattoo behind her ear
we had a great work Food Restaurant
Restaurant were about 20 of us and the S_Staff did a great job timing the courses
the Food was nothing extraordinary
i S_Delivery the new york F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem could've used a little more F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem we got before the F_FoodItem was the best thing i ate the whole night
one annoying thing at this Restaurant was that the F_Ingredients was so hard/cold you couldn't use it on the soft F_FoodItem
get with it
this is a A_Env_Type local Restaurant
the Service is quick and the S_Staff P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
it's a good Restaurant when you want mexican Food but want a step up from fast Food or casual quick
i will say, however, on both of my visits, my Food was good but arrived at my A_Fur_Table barely warm
would have been better had my Food been Service P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot
F_FoodItem for 2 including F_Drinks and Service was just over $40
00
very good Food
we are Restaurant for Food
and both of us S_Delivery F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
Restaurant are fantastic
but i don't like the F_Dessert because they are too sweet for me
so, i went to see javier colon in A_Entertainment on tuesday night
which i had been S_Del_Time for an opportunity to see him perform A_Ent_LiveShow since 2004, so i was stoked about going
i S_Delivery the O_Reservation, which were O_Reservation btw, at a decent F_FI_Price for A_Fur_Table O_Reservation
not bad for $38 per O_Reservation i thought
i S_Del_Time a week and a half for my O_Reservation to make their journey through the mail, but still nothing, even on the day of the A_Entertainment, nada! i called and was told they would be Restaurant at will call for me, so i show up after struggling to find a S_Seating for my daughter and the long drive from queen creek, only to just be escorted to our A_Fur_Table, no O_Reservation stub for a keepsake or Food(awesome #1
not)
we get to our A_Fur_Table and not only are the A_Fur_Table i O_Reservation not empty, but apparently they thought i'd be cool with letting someone else S_Seating in one of our O_Reservation A_Fur_Table and myself or my wife just slide over one
well, that would have been cool if i wanted my head right next to a pa system, and to krank my neck up like i was talking to shaq for 3 hours, but not only do i like my hearing, but i also have a bulging disc in my neck
(awesome #2!)
when we were A_Fur_Table, it took roughly 15 S_Del_Time before a S_Staff came to speak with us even to ask us if we wanted a F_Drinks or S_Menu
sure why not
my wife and i decide that we will each get one Food, i was gonna get a F_Drinks and she was getting a F_Dessert, since we had just eaten Food while on the way to the A_Entertainment
about 10 S_Del_Time later, a different S_Staff approached us, we gave our S_Delivery
only to be told that we must both S_Delivery 2 Food minimum, otherwise it will be an additional $10 per person(awesome #3) i'm pretty sure i O_Payment for my A_Entertainment O_Reservation, not a Food S_Cutlery
thanks though, not so much!we finally just got P_O_Experience/fed_up so that we told the S_Staff we were not going to S_Delivery any Food, only to be told, rudely i might add, that it states such on the O_Reservation stub(which once again we hadn't received)
obviously not an issue i could help them with, especially seeing as how their was barely even A_Places for anyone over 95 lbs
A_Env_Type is a good thing for a A_Entertainment, but do you really want the assortment of Food smells and F_Drinks F_FoodItem with the other customers bad breath as the scent of a date night
(that's #4!)after the A_Entertainment was over, right as we were in the process of getting up from our A_Fur_Table to make our way to the A_Fur_Door, our original S_Staff approaches us, immediately apologizing for the other S_Staff S_Stf_Behavior and S_Stf_Behavior
we stated it was fine but we will definitely never be P_O_Experience/going_back
for being nice, so to speak
i'd rather stick to real venues
that actually are about Service, not F_FI_Price
one thing i have learned in my life
Service people right, be Service right
no tip for you!
i have heard so much about this Restaurant, so i finally tried ifor my first time
it did not live up to the hype that was built
it was decent Service and decent Food, but not W_Price the F_FI_Price
$12
99 for a half rotisierre F_FoodItem
frys gives you a whole one for $5
99 and F_FoodItem tastes the same
i guess i was O_Payment for the dish soap used to wash the large S_Cutlery
so large, there was so much A_Places on them
just saying, if i am going to O_Payment the F_FI_Price charged Restaurant, i expected much better
i still may go, if someone can convince me i S_Delivery the wrong Food
it's fine
no, really, it's fine
seriously, it's fine
i'm not being sarcastic, it's fine
__________________________________(this is just for the Food Food, which i've had 10-15 times since i usually stay Restaurant when i come to pittsburgh)
day after thanksgiving me and my buddy thought we would have Food at chompies
the Restaurant was P_A_Env_Type/crowded but we got A_Fur_Table right away
at first glance it looked like any other major deli, but after seeing the S_Menu i saw that they have a different kind of S_Menu
wanting to try a something new i went for the famous "original jewish sliders" as featured on man vs Food
they are 2 pieces of F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem and and F_FoodItem, topped with F_FoodItem
it was great, and it was super filling
i don't know how he had 11 of them
i was full after 3
they are packed and rich with F_Ingredients
my friend S_Delivery the spanish F_FoodItem, and he said it wasn't very good, but he finished it cause he was hungry
overall i would have to try more stuff on the S_Menu to really judge this Restaurant
the Service was pretty good, and friendly, but a lot of the Food just looks average
Food is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
i had the vegenini, it is like a F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem
i loved it
the F_FoodItem are also P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
customer Service is always friendly
brian and his S_Staff are very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
the F_FI_Quality of the F_FoodItem and other Food are fantastic
i highly P_O_Experience/recommend the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, it's amazing
while not inedible, i don't think the F_Ingredients were at all authentic
we tried the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
of these, the F_FoodItem and v
F_FoodItem were best
the F_FoodItem was decent
the Food, even at medium, is not at all P_F_FI_Taste/spicy
we had the best F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem Restaurant
the F_FoodItem F_Appetizer is awesome
however, the F_FoodItem was way too P_F_FI_Healthy/salty
F_FoodItem was so P_F_FI_Healthy/salty that it ruined a good piece of good F_FoodItem
we should have taken it back, but we were too tired that we wanted to go back to our A_Plc_DiningRoom
the F_FoodItem was plain and the mash F_Ingredients was just ok
went to this Restaurant because it was S_OpenHours to the putt A_Places
sadly putt A_Places was a huge let down, but thankfully the Restaurant was yummy!we S_Delivery a little bit of everything
the S_Staff was great
we were pretty much the only A_Fur_Table Restaurant which can lead to S_Staff being all over you or nowhere in sight but not our S_Staff :) i will definitely P_O_Experience/go_back
we only went Restaurant because we had a S_Gift
the F_FoodItem had been sitting in dressing too long and was wilted, and the F_FoodItem were so F_FI_Quality i nearly broke a tooth! my daughter, who is 13, said her basic alfredo F_FoodItem was "disgusting", and i have to admit that it was pretty gross, swimming in F_Drinks and completely lacking any F_Ingredients
my husband's F_Drinks F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was very bland
but my F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, surprisingly, were very good! the S_Menu is all over the Restaurant
F_FoodItem? lebanese? american/? mexican? we don't know! will we P_O_Experience/go_back? probably not
my husband and i S_Delivery F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem and  benedict montreal smoked F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem are quite good
better than the same Food in other Restaurant
if i have to say what are not perfect on our S_Cutlery are the F_FoodItem and the F_Ingredients
the tates of the ppotatos are good and special, they are F_FI_CookingLevel with F_Ingredients and some kind of F_FoodItem
but they are  too much minced
i think it's because F_FoodItem are F_FI_CookingLevel
and we figure out they might make the F_Ingredients by themselves, the F_Ingredients is way too rich, you will feel very stuffed after eating two benedict F_FoodItem
and i'm P_O_Experience/surprised that they O_Payment for the F_Drinks which other Restaurant seem don't do
we O_Payment $35 O_Payment included for that Food
it's an enjoyable Food anyhow
we will go back again
would give them 1 O_Exp_StarsByCus but that's not fair as i'm a F_FI_Religious now
so this review is solely based on the F_FoodItem and Service
i S_Delivery a P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem to go and noticed they scooped the F_FoodItem out of a metal S_Cutlery F_FoodItem wasn't even being P_F_FI_CookingLevel/heated
the F_FoodItem were F_FI_Quality and barely F_FI_CookingLevel
i requested F_FoodItem but they said they didn't offer it except for with F_FoodItem?!?!  but i don't really eat F_FoodItem so i just wanted F_FoodItem and would O_Payment extra
nope they refused to sell me F_FoodItem
i only had a few F_Appetizer as the F_FoodItem were F_FI_Quality and then when i got home (tmi sorry) i rushed to the F_FI_Healthy
i guess my system rejected this F_FoodItem
ps- no a/c during 33 degree weather
gave an extra O_Exp_StarsByCus as i'm a F_FI_Healthy F_FI_Healthy eater and feel somewhat biased reviewing a fast Food joint
it's a great Restaurant and very customer-friendly
i loved the broth separation in the same pot (caters to different F_FI_Taste: check)
you are immersed in vapors and you come out feeling very full
i P_O_Experience/enjoyed almost everything i put on my S_Cutlery, but when the Restaurant is P_A_Env_Type/crowded the Food can get mixed up on the shelves
i really like it
i have been coming to casanova brothers for about 2 years and i can honestly say that i've never had less than an exceptional O_Experience
the S_Staff remember your name, ask about your family, and genuinely P_S_Stf_Behavior/care about each customer's O_Experience
the sicilian F_FoodItem is great, P_F_FI_Size/thick but never Food, and Food with the perfect F_FI_Size of F_Ingredients
however, the white F_FoodItem is what keeps me P_O_Experience/coming_back! you can S_Delivery by the slice or get the whole F_FoodItem, and my staple F_Ingredients on the white F_FoodItem are F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
a must try! A_Environment is inviting and the S_Staff are excellent
if you are a F_FoodItem snob, you will find no better F_FoodItem around!
the best ive had in a long time! S_Staff Service us like family and the Food was wonderful
finally a Restaurant w/ island style A_Places and S_Menu! i will be using the Service i just received as a model for the Restaurant i manage
thanks island F_Ingredients
great F_Drinks Restaurant with great Service! always happy with the F_Drinks and Food
keep up the good Service!!
awesome Service
awesome Food
F_FoodItem still the best experience ever, but should be shared
if you like kale, the kale caesar F_FoodItem is unbelievable
being korean i've learned that i cannot go a few days without eating korean Food i really don't know why, but it's something that i have to have within days
so i realized ginseng 3 opened about 6 months ago and my mom and i decided to go Restaurant for A_Environment
we had the mandu duk guk (dumpling F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_Appetizer) because it's F_FI_Religious to eat it on new years (long life or good luck
idk something like that) and F_FoodItem was good!!! i'm only giving it a 4 because i haven't had Food else Restaurant, but i will definitely update next time i P_O_Experience/go_back :)
gotta say i was O_Experience at this Restaurant
i maybe a frequent customer
they F_Ingredients the F_FoodItem then add a F_FoodItem based F_Ingredients on top of it
the F_FoodItem was just about falling off the F_FoodItem and good
the F_Ingredients on the F_FoodItem, frankly i gotta try it again
it was good i just couldn't get a feel for it
not spicy, a little sweet with smokyi also got a pulled F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, yes i did get a half a rack and a F_FoodItem, what, big man gotta eat!  the F_Ingredients on the A_Fur_Table where good i tried eat one
the F_Ingredients based one had a kick to it that i'm gonna venture and try again
i asked about the F_FoodItem F_Ingredients and they don't keep it on the A_Fur_Table just for the F_FoodItem
only bad part was how the Service the F_FoodItem in S_Cutlery for some reason that reminded me of school Food back in the day
i ate it though!i'll P_O_Experience/be_back at the rock store and we'll update when i've got a clearer A_Decor
a solid 4 O_Exp_StarsByCus on the que for now
my bf made O_Reservation a month or so back for our valentines day Food Restaurant
since we had a great time Restaurant at our anniversary Food (read my other review for that!)we were standing at A_Places for a good 10mins b/c Restaurant was noone Restaurant
so i eyed someone in the Restaurant to have them someone come over to help us
we S_Del_Time for 5mins in their lil A_Fur_Table area to be A_Fur_Table
and the Service was great but as amazing as it was last S_Del_Time though
we S_Delivery F_Drinks, i S_Delivery hot sour F_Appetizer since F_FoodItem is def P_F_FI_Taste/yummy, and we S_Delivery the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and shared both Food
boy! we were full! F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and i recieved a rose since it was vday :) so that was a great gesture!my bf and i would come Restaurant yet again
since its prob the only few Restaurant we would drop O_Payment for Food on
of course for a special occasion though aha
"never judge a book by its cover"
this is one of those small A_Places that people might not give a 2nd look
it's a free standing Ambience that has had its share of Restaurant tenants
if a buddy hadn't told me about luu's, i might never have spotted it
the Food is F_FI_CookingLevel P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, and it is good! F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem Food are my favorites
very casual, fast Food Ambience, but definitely dine-in Restaurant F_FI_Quality
tam and S_Staff are very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
Restaurant is a convenient drive-thru, also
check it out!
1 S_Cutlery of Food Restaurant should be enough for 4 small people or 2 large people
sooo, my rating isn't really regarding the Food
i've been twice- S_Del_Time until after the 2nd S_Del_Time to yelp to give them a fair chance but really wanted to share my O_Experience to possibly save somebody else from the hassle
both times the Food was pretty good
the F_FoodItem weren't amazing but they certainly weren't terrible either
my P_F_FI_Size/biggest F_FoodItem is with the Service
both times we had suuuuuuuper slow S_Staff
both S_Del_Time they screwed up at least 2 S_Del_Time
the first S_Staff gave us the wrong S_Delivery, i'm a good patron, i totally expect stuff happens and i usually give the benefit of the doubt
well- he again brought the wrong thing
how does one manage to do that!?we decided to give them another try since it's the closer bww to us and we were totally craving F_FoodItem
well? it was way worse this S_Del_Time
Food F_FI_Quality was the same- pretty good
Service? sucky
it was really odd because Restaurant seemed to be an over abundance of S_Staff scheduled this particular night and yet the Service was super slow
when the S_Staff finally came to take our S_Delivery, i S_Delivery a F_Drinks F_Drinks and my boyfriend S_Delivery a F_Drinks
so S_Staff comes back and does get my F_Drinks right, but brings him a completely different F_Drinks
i try to flag S_Staff down as S_Staff leaves without even asking if we were good and tell S_Staff S_Staff's given us the wrong F_Drinks
"oooops! i'll be back!" no lie- at least 5 mins S_Del_Time S_Staff finally shows up with the correct one
the Food arrived and this S_Del_Time Restaurant were no hiccups with the F_FoodItem, so we were just trying to enjoy the Food
so again i had to flag S_Staff down for a refill on my F_Drinks and again for the check since we wanted to catch a A_Entertainment
the check A_Entertainment up and i always look to make sure things are ok (especially when i can tell the S_Staff is a ditz) and sure enough- S_Staff O_Payment us for the incorrect F_Drinks and the one he originally S_Delivery and got eventually
i flag S_Staff down again and tell S_Staff about it and S_Staff S_Stf_Behavior and says S_Staff'll fix it
at this point, my boyfriend had given S_Staff the O_Pay_Method to O_Payment after S_Staff had fixed the tab
i warned him against it because the girl was dumb as rocks, but let the inevitable happen
S_Del_Time later S_Staff appears and says S_Staff's having trouble figuring out how to remove the O_Payment and that S_Staff had charged the O_Pay_Method before S_Staff changed the total
awesome
so now the S_Staff had to come and fix the whole mess and we were finally on our way
we both decided that we'd O_Experience to this particular A_LocatedArea and try the gilbert A_LocatedArea off gilbert
i love this Restaurant S_Staff is so nice and P_S_Stf_Appearance/professional
the Food is awesome, they have a great F_FI_Religious S_Menu and their F_Drinks are even better
no lengthy review needed
great Service, perfect (and honest) S_Menu on the S_Menu, and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Food
won't be our last S_Del_Time Restaurant
in S_Delivery of priority given the S_Del_Time i was Restaurant and i was not nearly as hungry as my partner in crime:5 O_Exp_StarsByCus - A_Places, A_Decor, A_Plc_Bar, A_Decor that goes on for miles, and the A_Plc_Bathroom are sweet
yeah, i said that
4 O_Exp_StarsByCus - the F_Drinks is great, the Food F_FoodItem, a downright treat4 O_Exp_StarsByCus - the A_Plc_Bar and S_Cutlery ware is out of this world
where did you get those F_Drinks S_Cutlery, i want one
2 O_Exp_StarsByCus - the Service, we S_Del_Time and S_Del_Time and S_Del_Time a good 30 S_Del_Time for a
S_Del_Time for it
a single Food F_FoodItem with a few F_Ingredients at 9:30 in the am on a saturday
the Restaurant was empty with the exception of a few A_Plc_Patio dwellers and a crazy S_Stf_Availability of S_Staff
so, rnr you are really really pretty but i can't bring you home to mom and dad because well, like you are not real stable if you know what i mean, but i will party with you any day!
super Service
the Food was excellent, you must try the swedish F_FoodItem
i really P_O_Experience/enjoyed mike and fletcher, a wealth of knowledge
this is a must stop in plaza midwood
what a P_O_Experience/disappointment!i was starving when i came Restaurant, so i S_Delivery a smoothie plus boba, and a F_FoodItem A_Places on a croissant with F_FoodItem and extra F_FoodItem, then tipped the S_Staff
i love F_FoodItem and boba, so i S_Del_Time with high anticipation for a P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem on par with the F_FI_Quality lee's popularity suggests
imagine my dismay when i instead got a stale, old, P_F_FI_Quality/tough F_FoodItem with pre-squished F_FoodItem, a minimal amount of F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, and wayyyyyy too much F_Ingredients!don't bother with the boba either, F_FoodItem really P_F_FI_Quality/hard and not P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
the F_FoodItem don't F_FI_Taste like real P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem either, even though they say they are
funny, i didn't know F_FoodItem could be shipped to nevada without being P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen
-_-;;  the F_FoodItem i got didn't even F_FI_Taste like P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen F_FoodItem
it tasted like a premade F_Ingredients added to a F_Ingredients
i should also mention that the S_Staff was fairly P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude while i was S_Delivery, like i was an inconvenience to S_Staff in showing up and politely expecting S_Staff to do S_Staff job for a S_Del_Time and a half
i was so hungry when i came Restaurant that i would have accepted even subway as passible Food
for me to feel this badly about what they offered is a pretty abysmal first O_Experience
due to such a stark lack of redeemable F_FI_Quality i won't be returning
not even at 2 in the morning, not even if every other Restaurant is closed
i'd rather go to a fast Food joint, eat a cliff A_Plc_Bar, or starve
i've studied and had my share of great and authentic japanese ramen--it's as much an A_Decor as a science
not bad
girls are really nice Restaurant--aiming to please
the A_Places is clean
it was great to see that they have the popular dual broth (tonkotsu-shoyu) that is quite trendy in japan
it was excellent
unfortunately the F_FoodItem are not made Restaurant--what a P_O_Experience/disappointment
the F_FoodItem was made too far in advance and thus cold and too hard
but i didn't expect that much out Restaurant in vegas, so it was a nice Food despite the F_FoodItem
this place has been on my radar for three months now
i finally made it for Food a few days ago, and i have to say -it was a P_O_Experience/disappointing O_Experience
i chose S_Menu Food f-6 (P_F_FI_Taste/spicy thai holy F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem) -which was stir P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients, and thai holy F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was sliced -not ground and was a little P_F_FI_Quality/tough and P_F_FI_Quality/dry
the Food appeared to be swimming in F_Ingredients -instead of a F_Ingredients
i didn't know sliced F_FoodItem could be greasy
the level 3 F_Ingredients out of 5 barely registered as spicy, and as a result the Food was bland
why do most thai Restaurant skimp on F_FoodItem? i thought this was a Food that featured F_FoodItem?  instead, i found myself on the hunt looking for F_FoodItem underneath the rubbery P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked F_FoodItem
the Restaurant itself is clean, quaint, and A_Environment
my S_Delivery was done in 10 S_Del_Time which was nice considering i was on my Food break
however, i would rather they took their S_Del_Time to make sure the Food actually tasted good
i won't come back as Restaurant are just too many good thai Restaurant to choose from in las vegas
i've been to the house at secret garden a few S_Del_Time for private events
the A_LocatedArea is absolutely gorgeous but their Food & Service is just mediocre
one event i went to was in the A_Plc_Patio & sun A_Plc_DiningRoom, and the other was in the urban barn
the A_Plc_Patio was very nice but the A_Plc_DiningRoom is a standard plain white A_Plc_DiningRoom
the urban barn is cute from the A_OutsideView but the inside is a little janky
the Ambience and Ambience are unfinished ugly wood with the manufacturer stamps still visible and spray A_Decor
they could have at least stained them a neutral brown
Restaurant are A_Decor Ambience painting on the A_Decor
not that impressive, but the A_OutsideView A_OutsideView (we had F_FoodItem under the carob tree) is beautiful
the Food and Service is a different story
one of the Food was catered by santa barabara catering and it was fantastic
if you're hosting an event Restaurant, i P_O_Experience/recommend going with a Food from the catering company
the other Food was a sit down, pre-selected 3 course Food
the A_Plc_Kitchen/S_Staff had zero coordination
one person out of the A_Fur_Table would get their P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot Food a good 10 S_Del_Time before anyone else got theirs
it was near impossible to get F_Drinks and was impossible to get a refill of F_Drinks
i thought the Food was P_O_Experience/disappointing
i had:- F_FoodItem F_FoodItem & F_FoodItem F_FoodItem: by far the best thing i had
great A_Decor, P_F_FI_Taste/yummy F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem
- F_FI_Religious trio: so P_F_FI_Size/small and just okay
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was very soggy and the F_FoodItem jam it was topped with was far too sweet for an Food
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious but i only got one
for my Food
if Restaurant had been 3 then it would have been a Food
- Food F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, & F_FoodItem F_FoodItem: amazing sounding description but one of the worst F_Dessert i've ever had
the F_FoodItem was so P_F_FI_Quality/dry and barely had a Food flavor
Restaurant was about a tablespoon's Worthiness of F_FoodItem and not even a teaspoon of F_FoodItem
so so dry and lacking the richness or flavor of a Food F_Dessert
- F_FoodItem F_Appetizer: much better than the Food F_FoodItem but still average
if you're planning on hosting an event at the house at secret A_Environment, i P_O_Experience/recommend trying to make it as S_Deliverys as possible (prettiest) and not using their in house catering
we walked in to le comptoir without a O_Reservation, and we got a great A_Fur_Table at the A_Places, where we could watch all of the hipster-esque S_Staff F_FI_CookingLevel beautiful Food all night long
we watched them send out Food after Food, and F_FoodItem looked -- and, more importantly, tasted -- delicious
we did not S_Delivery the F_FoodItem, which was probably a mistake, but we did have the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem loin, F_FoodItem, and the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was probably our least favorite, but we still P_O_Experience/enjoyed everything
they also had a great F_Drinks list with lots of approachable F_Drinks by the S_Cutlery, and very P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledgeable S_Staff
a great Food O_Experience all around
for my fiancee's first time in vegas S_Staff insisted on doing a Food
since i was going to be forced into going to one i decided to pick one of the decent ones and wicked spoon was my first S_Menu
really it wasn't bad (for Food Food), but it wasn't great either
i sampled the F_FoodItem and it was actually ok (for Food Food), and the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar was an interesting addition and not bad (for Food Food), and some of the F_FoodItem were enjoyable (for Food Food), and the overall F_FI_Quality of everything was pretty good (for Food Food)
really though, a lot of Food didn't work in the Food format
F_FoodItem in small Food didn't really seem to sit well, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem also seemed to suffer
actually everything unique about this Food seemed to suffer sitting in the Food format, and the P_F_FI_Size/small Food for everything and your small S_Cutlery seemed to want to force you into multiple trips back to the Food until you just can't be bothered anymore and leave
the good things Restaurant are the things that you see in other (P_F_FI_Price/cheaper) F_FoodItem
a pile of F_FoodItem legs on your S_Cutlery, a gigantic heap of mashed F_Ingredients, just about Food Service from a big communal trough worked (for Food Food)
F_Drinks Service was uneven and the F_FI_Price left a bad F_FI_Taste in my mouth
a greyhound is like $8 (since i guess it fits their spirit+mixer format), but a P_F_FI_Healthy/salty F_FoodItem which is a greyhound with a F_Ingredients rim is somehow 2 or 4 dollars more? that's some expensive F_Ingredients
so really what it comes down to is if the Food that is good is the F_FoodItem that you can get in a F_FI_Religious Food format works, and the special stuff Restaurant is all kind of mediocre and suffers for sitting in the A_Decor, what's the point of coming Restaurant? i can't really find one
that being said, if you have someone who really wants to go to a Food and you don't want the usual Food Food, then this one is ok (for Food Food)
edit: my fiancée just informed me the P_F_FI_Healthy/salty F_FoodItem was 14 dollars(!)
i'm never one to complain about F_FI_Price but Restaurant can't be any rationale behind that other than "you're in vegas, fuck you
"
i took the whole family Restaurant for Food on a sunday afternoon and Restaurant was about a 20 S_Del_Time S_Del_Time to sit down
figured it was a good thing that we were not the only ones Restaurant
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were good and the S_Staff was super P_S_Stf_Availability/busy but still took good care of us
we all S_Delivery some form of F_FoodItem and they were all good
S_Staff messed up my S_Delivery and brought me F_FoodItem instead of F_FoodItem which was ok because the F_FoodItem had a little kick to it
the kids had minichimis F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and they had no complaints
we will definateley be P_O_Experience/going_back
maybe next S_Del_Time we will take advantage of happy S_Del_Time
the F_Drinks and Food Restaurant is great
i love that they are S_Staff just F_Drinks, a locally roasted fair trade, organic F_Drinks that is S_Delivery by bicycle
they use organic and locally F_Ingredients products for their other S_Menu Food as well
nice A_Environment, with an open air A_Plc_Patio on the east side in the warm months
the S_Del_OrderingMethod for Service can be S_Del_Time, but they move quickly and the S_Del_Time is never very long
the F_FI_Price seem reasonable for the F_FI_Quality of Food - the old "you get what you O_Payment for" matra!
love this Restaurant
the Food is amazing, Ambience is really nice, and the S_Staff (luke) is fantastic
my friends and i come Restaurant often and we love it
P_F_FI_Taste/yummy F_FoodItem, great A_Entertainment, P_S_Stf_Behavior/welcoming S_Staff and good Service
periodically i go in search of a good local Food for just a good Food
this Restaurant is the perfect A_LocatedArea Restaurant
it's not fancy, the A_Furniture don't match it's just a simple Restaurant and i love it! the Food is great, Service is quick and friendly and the F_FI_Price is good! i will be bringing my friends and family Restaurant from out of town after a night of too much fun
we just came back from this Restaurant tonight
we really P_O_Experience/enjoyed our dinner at this P_A_Env_Size/tiny ethiopian Restaurant
the Food was full of flavour
they offered extra injera for no extra O_Payment
we had the F_FI_Religious combo and a F_Ingredients Food which turned out to be a little too much Food for us- we are stuffed right now! and the F_FI_Price, $31 including O_Payment! F_FoodItem was really reasonable for the huge A_Places we got
the 2 S_Staff were so nice
Food came out fast and we were P_O_Experience/impressed with the F_FI_Quality of it
we will P_O_Experience/be_back!disclaimers and other notes: A_Decor is basic, but it seems like they have A_OutsideView A_Fur_Table
we would have taken it, but it's too cold tonight
they did not really have F_Dessert S_Menu and Restaurant is no F_Drinks, so you may want to opt to plan F_Drinks/sweets into your evening A_OutsideView the F_FoodItem Food
this is not Food that poeple eat with S_Cutlery- a lady near our A_Fur_Table P_O_Experience/suggested many times to the S_Staff that they must get S_Cutlery
and when he tried to explain his cultural tradition
S_Staff was all: ya, but you really need S_Cutlery
it was kind of hilarious
enjoy!
this brewery is pretty dope
i like the ipa's but i'd stay away from those F_Ingredients F_FoodItem
good Service, looks more like a Restaurant
overall a good Restaurant to chill and F_Drinks F_Drinks
the best soul Food hands down! i got the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem wi th F_FoodItem n F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem n F_FoodItem
that kill O_Payment
best rueben in town! i take my ruebens seriously, i judge a Restaurant on it
if you mess up a rueben you're dead to me
the S_Staff was great and i liked the overall feel of the Ambience
wow! we had the F_FoodItem & F_Appetizer, F_FoodItem & F_Appetizer
if you eat nothing else for the rest of your life make it the F_Appetizer
had high expectations from all the great reviews from yelp
i know ramen places tend to be salty (though i've eaten at a few places that weren't), and this was no exception
if the ramen and the F_FoodItem was flavorful, i couldn't really tell because the F_Ingredients content drowned out all the flavor
i had the F_Appetizer and my gf had the F_Appetizer
both were equally salty
i even added a bowl of hot water to my F_Appetizer and it was still salty
ugggh!  and the two slices of F_FoodItem i got in my F_Appetizer was literally more fat than F_FoodItem
and now i'm feeling so thirsty
definitely not one of the better Restaurant for F_FoodItem
i will not be returning
the best restaurant for Food in phoenix!!!
customer S_Staff, Food and F_Drinks are always excellent
every time we visit las vegas we make it a point to have Food Restaurant
we P_O_Experience/recommend it to everyone that visits las vegas
my husband is very picky when it comes to everything and he always walks out raving about this place so i know they are doing Food right Restaurant
Restaurant is so good he signed up for a yelp account so he personally can give it 5 stars (very unlike him)
i was really looking forward to eating at this food truck, but after eating their F_FoodItem, i would have to agree with the other reviewers -its not that great
portion was a good size but it was pretty bland and needed more F_FoodItem
unfortunately, won't be visiting this Food truck again
went back today with the whole family
i have to P_O_Experience/suggest the F_FoodItem!  it's like a F_FoodItem, but so much better!  the F_FoodItem isn't P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, but it is crisp, light and not greasy
a great option for those who like crunch
my dad had the F_FoodItem and was really happy
he's not a big fan of F_FoodItem, so the F_FoodItem was the perfect S_Menu for him
he thought this was a great Restaurant because Restaurant are so many different options
definitely go for the carne asada or al pastor on Food!
it was alright
nothing special
pretty average
Food arrived lukewarm, had to heat it up for a bit
way too much F_FoodItem for the F_FoodItem Food
the F_FoodItem was very good F_FI_Quality though
it had probably been twenty years since i had tried any F_FoodItem on a stick and now i remember why
we S_Delivery three hotdogs on a F_FoodItem, one on a stick, F_FoodItem tenders and two F_Drinks and that came to over $30
okay
let me start by saying i've never felt more ripped off in my life
P_F_FI_Size/tiny shriveled F_FoodItem and third-rate F_FoodItem
i mean seriously, if the F_FoodItem were $0
99 instead of $3
85 i might not be writing this
but they weren't
likewise, the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Size/thickly F_FoodItem and looked like F_FoodItem had been deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried some weeks ago and merely heated up
in fact, i'm nearly sure that is how it was
the actual "F_FoodItem on a stick" we got, according to my wife, was fine
i will give them high marks on their fine F_Drinks
F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/tasty and great
in short, i would have to be starving and this be literally the last Restaurant on earth before i'd P_O_Experience/go_back
it was that bad
and a horrific value proposition, especially when you consider the excellent costco F_FoodItem just a few miles away
i predict this A_LocatedArea will close down within less than a year - it is a weird A_LocatedArea with a weird drive-thru and inadequate signage
a great addition to this A_LocatedArea
the A_Places and A_Plc_Patio areas were nice and well kept
the S_Staff were extremely P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful and P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
i love that i can S_Delivery my F_FoodItem F_Ingredients, or green style as they called it
their F_Appetizer was heavenly! we will P_O_Experience/go_back
i wish they had F_Appetizer!
best F_FoodItem in the world customer Service is great i would really P_O_Experience/recommend als chicago finest F_FoodItem!!!!! good Food Service and yummy
Food was mediocre at best, and P_F_FI_Price/overpriced
rotating F_Drinks on S_Cutlery is a great idea, but half a pint for the pint F_FI_Price just seems wrong
S_Staff was nice, Restaurant were only for other A_Fur_Table while we were Restaurant
can't see making a return visit
pulling up to this Restaurant the 1st good indicator, lotsa indians outside with obvious full & happy bellies
the A_Environment could've been any Restaurant
nothing indian abou it, but that's fine
it was clean & didn't smell like sweaty feet
the Food is just a few tems & i tasted them all
very good! the F_FoodItem was great & plentiful & the Service efficient
but the draw if this Restaurant is that it's really inexpensive
$7
i'll keep this place in mind at the end of the month & needing to rob the coin jar
love this Restaurant
it is tucked in a P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant off the strip in chinatown
the Service was great and the lady who took our S_Delivery was incredibly friendly
it is interesting to see the 3 different F_Appetizer base F_FoodItem that they offered
this was how each F_Ingredients was described to us by the S_Staffkome F_FoodItem (hokkaido style) - their best selling F_Ingredientsshiro F_FoodItem (kyoto style) - very similar to your regular F_FoodItem soupright side is mame F_FoodItem (nagoya style) - F_Appetizer was flavorful and filling
they have a monthly Offers and this month's was free F_Ingredients add-on
the other add-ons were O_Payment (like F_FoodItem), but it's not a big deal for me
at the end of our Food, we were offered free lychee ice cream and stamp cards
if i lived closer to vegas, i would definitely come Restaurant again
this Restaurant rocks!  found this place on yelp coz i was craving for asian Food and my white business partner was craving for hard F_Drinks
great Offers Offers, Food is great and the F_Drinks are legit
A_Environment is the bomb and the A_Ent_Music really is upbeat
S_Staff is really P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
this is a new go-to Restaurant for me
last S_Del_Time i went, we were given poor banchan while the two A_Fur_Table next to us received much higher F_FI_Quality banchan (?) we got F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients and some F_FoodItem, while they had F_FoodItem, kimch radish, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem sprouts, etc
why???? also kept hearing the lady in the A_Plc_Kitchen that S_Staff "found the F_FoodItem" after overhearing the S_Staff tell the A_Fur_Table next to us that they were out of P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem
how do you lose the Food in your A_Plc_Kitchen?! i had apparently S_Delivery the last S_Delivery for P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem, but i was F_FI_Quality and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked
the F_FI_Price are also a bit unreasonable
the nengmyn-kalbi combo comes with a good A_Places of F_FoodItem but literally 4 pieces of F_FoodItem
probably won't be returning Restaurant for a while
i love F_FoodItem and go
the delicious F_FoodItem and nice S_Staff make my day
eating Restaurant is making me more healthy
it's a very convenient drive through with A_OutsideView A_Fur_Table
it's clean and the S_Staff P_S_Stf_Behavior/care about us
the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/patient with me when i asked about organics
they serve P_F_FI_Size/large filling F_FoodItem for an inexpensive F_FI_Price
as a single person who has P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh Food spoil in the A_Furniture, i would like to divert my whole grocery budget to them
mean F_FoodItem, as usual
A_LocatedArea in the new forum A_Places at caesars Ambience
i grab earl of F_FoodItem every time i go to vegas so i was excited to see another one open
my family was shopping at the forum shops and needed a quick F_Appetizer
we decided to eat at the A_Places we passed by on our way to the Restaurant
little did i know that the forum A_Places opened that very day
i S_Delivery an F_FoodItem blt on F_FoodItem
loved how they used crumbled F_FoodItem instead of F_FoodItem
every F_Appetizer had the right amount of F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients, and F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem can make just about any F_FoodItem better
the balance between the F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients was just right which really put this F_FoodItem over the top for me
Service with a smile and no S_Del_OrderingMethod during this visit
hope it stays that way
earl of F_FoodItem, conquering caesars Ambience
i like Restaurant here
i've only visited in the past for Offers or F_Drinks out with friends
recently, both times i came late in the evening after work functions and arrived hungry
coincidentally, both nights i was there was also salsa night
it's an interesting A_Env_Type, all ages, just gettin' their salsa on
i enjoy the A_Ent_Music, but will sit back and let the "pros" do the dancing
they have friendly Service, a few outdoor A_Fur_Table and a huge A_Plc_Bar
it's a pretty lounge-y vibe
there is a decent F_Drinks/F_Drinks list, and also specialty F_FoodItem
both times, i tried the F_FoodItem, which was not bad at all - not comparing to a japanese Restaurant, but for a A_Plc_Bar it was done well
the F_Appetizer one was really hot, F_FI_CookingLevel with a jalepeno: nice touch
i also S_Delivery the house F_FoodItem, which was a Food in itself
seriously F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Size/huge! the F_Ingredients were fresh, and with some F_Drinks and olive oil, it was very enjoyable
for F_Drinks or A_Decor fare, bossa nova is one happening spot in the downtown area, which seems to be on the up and up!

macalpine's is a staple of old phoenix
dating back to the30's, this F_Drinks shop Service customers of the valley since 7st was a dirt road off the beaten path
they do a Service retaining the Ambience of an age gone by, F_FoodItem on both sides by antique and vintage stores
there's plenty to look at
unfortunately i can't say the F_FoodItem (turkey or cow) were very good
not bad, just bland and uninspired
the F_Drinks are fun
on my first visit i tried 2 of the 99 options, including Food (peach) and Food (cherry F_FoodItem)
both were good, but next time i'm going to ask for way less syrup
all in all i'd say i would P_O_Experience/come_back again and again, but probably just for F_Dessert
we came here last sunday on father's day for the S_OpenHours
W_Price is definitely W_Price it for the Food, Service and A_Entertainment
$25 for the Food style for the cold items and $10 extra for the unlimited made to S_Delivery small plates of 7 different hot items, F_Drinks not included
the Food had F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, 4 diff F_FoodItem rolls, assorted F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, varieties of F_Dessert
i am not usually big fan of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem at Food place, but theirs were really good and F_FI_CookingLevel perfect
a bit P_O_Experience/disappointed that they put all the F_FI_Size F_FoodItem on top but the bottom ones hidden under the F_FI_Size ones were the small ones
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were awesome
F_Dessert were very pretty and decent but mostly too sweet to my F_FI_Taste
F_FoodItem were pretty good
we tried all the 7 hot plates to be shared among the 3 of us, the F_FoodItem was soooo P_F_FI_Taste/delish that i had two S_Delivery of it and i don't usually even like the smell of lamb, but this didnt have the heavy smell
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were really good, except that i didn't quite enjoy the combination of the F_Ingredients bits on the waffle
i also loved the F_FoodItem mini F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem was yuck and the most raved F_FoodItem was not special
i didn't get to try the F_FoodItem and mac n F_FoodItem, but hubby said the F_FoodItem was good but F_FoodItem was just average
we called ahead to let them know that it was also our anniversary and they would take note of it, but it didn't appear that any note was made
i know it's only brunch and not full dinner but would still appreciate a bit recognition on it, so i ended up asking the host if they could do something
so came an empty plate with chocolate writing saying happy anniversary on it and was told to get some F_Dessert from the Food to put on the plate
may be that's how they do it, i don't have complaint but was not exactly expecting an empty plate :) overall, i would have no problem returning there for a casual upscale brunch
what a find!!!  i drive by this Restaurant all the time and always mentally say "humm jess, you should try that place" next time i am going to listen to my gut, because i was missing out! inside is a very cute, cozy Ambience
S_Staff is super nice here
you get complimentary won ton F_Appetizer and delicious chinese F_Drinks when you get A_Fur_Table( this is pretty rare)
the S_Menu is large which lead us into gluttony
and people i am not ashamed because everything was derrrlicious :)edamame, ribs, angel puffs(crab puff), F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem (catching my breath)
sake
more hot F_Drinks
and then F_Appetizer and chocolate for F_Dessert
yummmmhonestly i eat chinese/asian/thai a lot, and this was one of the best places i have came across in my quest for  great asian Food
why not O_Exp_StarsByCus then you say?? well i am a fan of A_Furniturenone here), and i just can't hand out O_Exp_StarsByCus like candy
but def a high four!

don't come for the Service
don't come for the Ambience or cleanliness
don't come for the other Food
come for the pie
jack daniel's F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/divine
F_Drinks is outstanding
F_FoodItem is top-notch
there's no other reason to stop here and if you're driving by you need to stop here
it's all about the pie
i am use to going here for teppan (F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem) and F_FoodItem and have always had a good O_Experience
better than benihana!Service and S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful
this was my first time here for Food
W_Price are great
i also love that they offer half F_FoodItem on some of their F_FoodItem
i got the F_FoodItem teriyaki w/ F_FoodItem tempura, comes with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem was very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
and it was a good F_FI_Size of Food for $8
50
i also got F_FoodItem, which was okay
i got to sample around at some of my friends Food
F_FoodItem F_FoodItem i've never had was P_F_FI_Taste/yummy and the F_FoodItem (wasn't as bad as it looks:)we also got different F_Dessert at the end, the chocolate tempura F_Ingredients cream was heavy but yummy, F_FI_Taste like a funnel cake with F_Ingredients cream
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, the warm chocolate filling made the Food
my favorite was the F_FoodItem (yes at a japanese Restaurant), it was reminiscent of creme brulee
the F_FoodItem wasn't great, might have been in the freezer too long
while the F_FoodItem in this spot doesn't hold a candle to i love F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem, the Service and half F_FoodItem make up for it overall
i consistently have a great Service experience here and have never had to S_Del_Time for a A_Fur_Table
plus, there is very little bullsh$t at the F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar which is sometimes appreciated on a "school" night
the F_FoodItem is another story altogether, F_FoodItem is a P_F_FI_Taste/tasty affair and the F_FoodItem Food is some of the best i've ever had! most certainly Worthiness a visit!

i've only been here once and it wasn't busy so Service was not a problem when i went
the Food was soooo good! we had the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was moist and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, tostones, maduras, F_FoodItem, moros y cristianos
omg everything was awesome! i will definitely P_O_Experience/go_back!

excellent Food, great Service
wished we had found this Restaurant a couple years ago when we moved here
W_Price is excellent and Ambience very comfortable
found our new "chinese Food!"

dinner for 4
everyone was happy for the most part
my F_FoodItem was a little P_F_FI_Healthy/salty
F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delish! Restaurant looked great and our S_Staff was nice
i have been to azteca many times and have always been P_O_Experience/satisfied
this time not so much
i can't put my finger on the reason, but i have to wonder if this time was an exception, or if the place had changed
before this visit i would have O_Exp_StarsByCus azteca 4, but now it's a generous 3
i have just discovered the common market and i couldn't be happier that i did
it reminds me of a funky little deli from back home so it gives me the warm fuzzies while i peruse their killer F_Drinks selection
they have everything a micro brew lover could want, including big bottles and single serve, build your own 6 packs
they also have a great wine selection and they even carry sake!  there are lots of F_Appetizer, Food items, and organic choices, as well as off the A_Decor Service and trinkets like "obama-mints
"  i have never actually eaten at the deli, but i'm sure it's great too
oh and you can also buy single cigarettes for 33 cents
so, if you are craving just one, cm is the place to go
after  reading the yelp reviews, i went to diamond around 3pm in the afternoon for a "snack"
they had a surprisingly sophisticated F_Drinks S_Menu so i S_Delivery a bloody mary made with their house mix, absolut F_Drinks and topped with pickled F_FoodItem
as i am watching the S_Staff make the bloody mary, she puts the cheapest F_Drinks in the glass and then precedes to pour a mix over it which had a terrible A_Decor!  i love a good bloody mary
this bloody mary was no bueno - W_Price F_Drinks, crappy mix and no pickled F_FoodItem
on to the Food - i S_Delivery F_FoodItem and F_Appetizer
the F_Appetizer were good - the F_FoodItem were not
F_FoodItem were chewy, not P_F_FI_Quality/spicy and P_F_FI_Quality/dry
fast forward 3 hour and i feel terrible - in fact, i am in and out of the A_Plc_Bathroom for a good 2 hours
never again
if you're looking for good, W_Price, greasy Food try pinky's!

the F_FoodItem is ridiculously good
seriously
and the homemade F_FoodItem are also outstanding
aside from that, F_FoodItem is average at best
as mentioned by others, this is americanized mexican Food
this is not autentica comida mexicana, mi amigos!we had been once before and thoroughly P_O_Experience/enjoyed the Food
hence making it a point to P_O_Experience/visit_again on our most recent trip to arizona
we started with the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem set for the A_Fur_Table - P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
i S_Delivery a bunch of F_FoodItem for the A_Fur_Table, and i started with a F_FoodItem
it was hilariously underwhelming
i made the joke that it was A_Plc_Kitchen scraps, and it looked the part
it was light F_FoodItem broth with a bunch of F_FoodItem, a gob of F_FoodItem and a small corn on the cob on top
yes, a small corn on the cob is on top
it was lousy and i wouldn't P_O_Experience/recommend it
we S_Delivery a pound of F_FoodItem and a half pound of F_FoodItem ones (thanks to the vegetarian fiancee)
it went surprisingly far for five of us
but the F_FoodItem weren't P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled much, which is sad because F_FoodItem were otherwise P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
also, the F_FoodItem only had one piece of green F_FoodItem and one of red on top
it should be lush with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem that have been P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled or possibly even F_FI_CookingLevel (the F_FoodItem)
daniel e
wrote in his review the same concern, that there should be "more than a pile of F_FoodItem," that he expected at least some green, red or yellow F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem were good and quite filling
the accompaniments were decent - F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients, sour cream and the like
nothing fancy, certainly no frills
so much potential, but it fails on almost everything
it's a true shame
this place needs to be on Restaurant impossible with robert irvine
badly
this time around
the Service was really lousy
and my fiancee found a bug deep down in her F_Drinks
very P_O_Experience/disappointing
the S_Staff first replied confirming what size bug it was, and then explained it and claimed that "we're not dirty, it's just the Food smell
" then she apologized and walked away
we think she deducted a F_Drinks from the final bill
but nothing else
a bug!and the A_Places smelled like a high school locker room
it was foul on the way in and out
sad to say that we may likely not return in the future
i'm not sure if our family and friends in the greater phoenix area will either after the bug incident
this Restaurant had the P_F_FI_Price/cheapest and best F_FoodItem (that is how they spell it) pita of anywhere in town
the falafel was F_FI_CookingLevel, flavorful the F_Ingredients was fresh and there was a copious amount of F_Ingredients to cover it
the F_FoodItem was a bit P_F_FI_Size/thin but F_FoodItem can be P_F_FI_CookingLevel/over_looked
at under $3 it might be W_Pricewhile to get two
as for the hummous we had on the side, it was a great texture but a bit low on F_FI_Taste
make sure you S_Delivery an extra pita and it comes with just one
we got the S_Delivery to go so we did not really have any Service to review
when you first walk in you are assaulted by the smells of many spices and many other alien things to most americans
there is an attached small market full of spices, and exotics Food and F_FI_Taste tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice
the counter is full of many types of balaclava and olives
if you want a great F_FoodItem at a good W_Price, be brave and stop in
just leave your pro bush / israel gear in the car
ok, i get it that everyone is excited you finally opened
we (party of 5) came in today for brunch
after asking two S_Staff 3 time for F_Drinks and half way thru my Food, i finally got F_Drinks
i also asked our S_Staff for the F_Ingredients which i had to remind him again half way thru my Food
after O_Payment our check 2 of decided to have a shot of corralejo tequila
i went to the A_Plc_Bar where i stood for over 5 minutes while the S_Staff and S_Staff watched the A_Entertainment ignoring me
i left and the returned, still no Service
i finally said in a loud voice to the S_Staff
quit watching the A_Entertainment and get me our F_Drinks
this is a terrible way to keep customers
not sure we will return
$30 for 2 shots that i pretty much had to beg to get is rediculous
happy holidays
Food is amazing they have the best F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem i've ever had in las vegas!!!! i also tried the F_FoodItem and orange F_FoodItem!! all  i highly P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant to all who enjoy great Service and a relaxing dining Ambience!

you can't really go wrong when you walk into a Restaurant S_Delivery a beautiful bottle of F_FoodItem and a decadent Food with all your favorite things
i was dazzled with my dinner choice comprised of a petite file mignon topped with crab, drizzled with a crab mignonette cream, goat F_FoodItem whipped potatoes, F_FoodItem fritti, sauteed wild F_FoodItem, and brussel sprouts sauteed in pancetta, lemon, and browned F_Ingredients
not to mention that i had the best key lime pie yet! simply P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful, simply F_FI_Quality, and simply a great choice to satisfy my craving for F_FoodItem
hats off to the palm!

i always come here once a year for the F_FoodItem bordelaise n pomme F_FoodItem!! their fries is the only one i would eat
F_FoodItem are so P_F_FI_Taste/crispy n P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
F_FoodItem is good
for adventurous foodie
n not for the faint hearted
or country bumpkin who's not open minded to try anything at least once
the pate is good
the F_Drinks is good
if you ever want to eat somewhere with P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Food and have stunning A_OutsideView of the A_Decor at the bellagio, this is the Restaurant to be! F_FoodItem's had incredible Service and appetizing Food! my boyfriend and i had our anniversary dinner here and let me just say, it is one that i'll never forget
a few tips:make O_Reservation and if you don't mind eating a early dinner, make it for 5, that's when dinner starts
you'll for sure get a good A_Furniture seat or A_Plc_Patio A_Fur_Table
S_Delivery a F_Drinks, a nice dinner is not complete without a tasty F_Drinks
we S_Delivery bellinis and they were perfect
don't eat too much F_FoodItem because the A_Places are pretty decent
from experience, it was pretty hard for me to stop snacking on the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
but you want room for their mouthwatering Food! i had the ricotta F_FoodItem with italian sausage and my boyfriend had the goat F_FoodItem dumplings with F_FoodItem, this was mainly where my 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus rating came from
the Food was amazingly delectable!!!!!!!

never in my life did i A_Decor myself hitting up a Food in vegas
what can i say
it always seemed gimmicky i guess
so i crashed here for a night
the room was pimp and exceeded expectation
i had been driving all freaking day and in dire need of something delicious
no O_Reservation, no snacks and screw eating shit from the mini A_Plc_Bar
so me and buddy mosey on down to the  Food while gawking at the numerous hot females walking around
back to the Food
Restaurant was great first and foremost
the F_FoodItem was just okay, bland and the selection of F_FoodItem was pretty eh
anyway not F_FI_Quality F_FoodItem
the F_Drinks was really juicy and P_O_Experience/satisfied my craving for blood
the F_FoodItem were really good and the F_FoodItem were mighty P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
the F_FoodItem stuffed F_FoodItem things were great, smothered in a creamy white F_Ingredients
pesto mashed potatoes, duck, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, dim sum, everything was really good and the F_FI_Quality of the Food was overall pretty good
i left this place feeling like a really content blob
the Service was great and the F_Drinks were pretty good
nice Food
good enough to wipe my Food grudge away for the time being
based on Food to-go:first of all, can we give a shout out to all joints that serve their Food S_Menu all day? *applause* already started off with 1 star
2nd star came when we found out we could S_Delivery to-go & it would be ready to pick up in 20 minutes, smack dab in the middle of their morning rush
*high-five lux!*3rd star came when we picked up our S_Delivery off to the side of the entrance where the bakery is and they conveniently had other items like baked goods and all different kinds of F_Drinks
i see you, lux
i see you!4th star came when i bit into that scrumptious Food sammich
that bad boy was huge! i thought i had S_Delivery two of them or something
but don't me wrong, i still devoured that sucker, it just took me a little longer
only thing is that i wish they put a tiny bit more effort into their hash browns
mine were kinda bland and barely F_FI_Taste
another off note: we S_Delivery ranch over the phone, when we picked up we also confirmed if they packed the ranch (they said they did), but when we got back to our room, no ranch to be seen
bummer cause ranch is my boo boo
not cool, but it happens
something to note- i'm not sure of its connection to the cheesecake factory: it used to be one? it's owned by the same company? not sure but it definitely had the same vibe and i love me some cf so i ain't mad at it!i would definitely come back!

we went here because we got a gift card for xmas, i thought F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delish we stared off with the calamari was a little under seasoned but not fishy, the complementary F_FoodItem was great and then we had a F_FoodItem that was good the S_Staff was the nicest ever
we had a fifty dollar S_Gift card and ended up using $38 on dinner and two F_Drinks and gave the rest to her for being super nice
would go again even without a gift card
this review is coming from someone who was born and raised in hk
we have different standard on Food than people from other culture
if you happened to be from an area outside of canton/hk this review will not help you
this used to be my most favorite Restaurant in vegas for its high F_FI_Quality authentic cantonese Food
yet the most recent visit proved to a a disaster
this place had lost its authentic cantonese F_FI_Taste, the pan F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem was saturated with gravy, my pan F_FoodItem was over filled with sweet and sour F_Ingredients (it was supposed to be dry), and the F_FoodItem rib F_FI_Taste just gross
Service is ok; but i would say that Food had downgraded to american Food style
i will not P_O_Experience/come_back
i love this Restaurant
the Ambience is beautiful and the Food is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
great creativity and fresh F_Ingredients
execution? good, but not stellar
most of us had luke P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm Food, but i was too lazy (since it felt like forever to get our Food), to cry about it and send it back
more like a 3-4 range, but the flavor and temperature were lacking
they do have an awesome smores mocha that you should probably share
actually, share anything you S_Delivery because the portion will be monster
we came for brunch on a friday and had a short wait
best thing was probably my friend's banana F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasty and the broiled (?) bananas were the perfect addition
would i P_O_Experience/go_again for that W_Price? probably not
maybe the san diego sister location would be better
fun place to hangout at, and they have this really cool bridge
lol

my wife and i go here a couple times a year for quite a while now
the Food is very good, as is the Service
i usually get the lasagna without looking much at the S_Menu
the house chianti works well
it's all certainly good enough that we keep going back
the A_Environment is usually P_A_Env_Type/quiet, even when the A_Environment is P_A_Env_Type/busy
that means we can talk easily in a calm voice
on the nights that augie is there with his accordion, the A_Environment is usually P_A_Env_Type/busier, and i have to think it's at least partly because of augie
he doesn't just play around with the squeeze box--he's good!  he's a classically trained musician, and really puts himself into it, especially when he knows you appreciate it
this review should be split into two categories: Service and Food F_FI_Quality
the Food was 5-O_Exp_StarsByCus
P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful, generous, and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
the Service was 2 O_Exp_StarsByCus
our party was one of two in the entire Restaurant
due to the fact the 3 S_Staff were seated in another part of the Restaurant catching up, i had to get up and request F_Drinks and other things we needed
from start to finish, Food for 3 people took close to 1
5 hours between S_Del_Time for Service
always happy to find a good ethiopian Restaurant and definitely P_O_Experience/recommend the Food here
just plan on the extra time for the waiting you will do
our favorite F_FoodItem in the valley
huge F_FI_Size for the W_Price
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem are our favorite
also P_O_Experience/recommend the F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem is awesome!

great Service
we enjoy the Food, but i believe the naperville, il A_LocatedArea is better
they seem to offer a larger variety of specials
but, and thats a large but, the scottsdale location is still a must try
my favorite item is the quinoa F_FoodItem
i think i would have to agree with kristin and sunny and say that this place gets a lot more credit that it might otherwise deserve because it's a non-chain, non-fast Food chinese place in south phoenix
i admire the S_Staff for taking a risk and opening this place in this particular area and for bringing some ethnic Food to the masses
that being said, the Food isn't spectacular
the first time my husband and i went there, it was at dinnertime and we thought the Food was decent
the F_FI_Taste honey F_FoodItem ($7
95) was a bit too sweet and not as P_F_FI_Taste/crispy as one would hope, but the mongolian F_FoodItem ($9
50) was tender and pretty P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
we also had the crab puffs for $4
95, which were fine but no better than the ones at panda express
the W_Price were low, Service good, and overall, it was an ok dining O_Experience
however, when we returned for Food today, we were a bit P_O_Experience/disappointed
having P_O_Experience/enjoyed a F_FoodItem Food during the last visit, i decided to try the volcano F_FoodItem Food special
my husband got the general tso F_FoodItem
their website says Food specials are $4
95, but i believe they were $5
50 each
the F_FoodItem was ok, but again, F_FoodItem wasn't that P_F_FI_Taste/crispy
sesame F_FoodItem, general tso F_FoodItem, and other similar Food are only really good if the Food is very P_F_FI_Taste/crispy and the F_Ingredients adds flavor not sogginess
the F_Ingredients that came with the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/spicy and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and the accompanying F_FoodItem (carrot, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and bok choy) were really fresh, but the F_FoodItem itself was really bad F_FI_Quality
on the upside, the F_FoodItem that came with both Food specials was really good
the filling was savory, and it almost F_FI_Taste like it was F_FI_CookingLevel in F_Ingredients! i am certainly glad that the S_Staff of sun asian A_Plc_Kitchen brought Food to south phoenix, but i hope that many more asian restaurateurs follow suit and open Restaurant in this area, so that kristin, sunny, and i have more options to choose from! until then, i'll be frequenting sun asian A_Plc_Kitchen for Offers (in particular, for the $3 crab puffs) or to-go and driving elsewhere when i went real, good-F_FI_Quality asian Food
i went here today
i S_Delivery a F_FoodItem and F_Appetizer and was told they're out of fries
are you serious?  that's a first ever for me
the F_FoodItem was like $7
that's an insane W_Price for a F_FoodItem but i was hungry so i O_Payment
i had to wait about fifteen S_Del_Time for the F_FoodItem to come out and there was only one other customer in the Restaurant
when the F_FoodItem finally arrived it was cold and they didn't provide any napkins
i was thoroughly P_O_Experience/disappointed and will not P_O_Experience/go_back again
now i'm starting to feel sick
all i can say is the horrible Service overrode everything that could possibly have been good about the Food
the Ambience of this establishment was very cool and hip and had an abundance of open A_Env_AC seating which was most welcome coming into phoenix from michigan winter that same day
however, our S_Staff was not good at all!  we S_Del_Time for F_Drinks for over 10 mins
and when i needed a refill, because that was all i was drinking, forget about it
i had to flag another S_Staff down while i could see my S_Staff rolling silverware
we were eating with another couple and she never asked if we wanted the bill split either which i thought was unacceptable
ok
for the Food
i had the F_FoodItem F_Ingredients verde F_FoodItem was very P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and the cornbread that came with it, i wished i had more of it
my husband had the kale and F_FoodItem and kale F_FoodItem which he thought was very good but the F_FoodItem were just that, nothing special
even with the hen F_FoodItem
the other couple we were with had been here several times and obviously have had much different O_Experience than we had because i don't think i would P_O_Experience/go_back unless it was for a F_FoodItem because they had a pretty good looking list and the A_Plc_Bar area had A_Fur_Table and A_Places to mingle
one of my favorite things about home plate is that it is A_Env_Type on the dining side and perfectly "A_Plc_Bar" friendly on the gaming side
i only wish it was smoke free on both, but i know that will never happen in vegas
both sides of the establishment (separated by large glass A_Furniture) have a large number of A_Ent_Tv
some are a bit outdated and could use an upgrade, but big numbers just the same
the A_Plc_DiningRoom also has a small A_Plc_DiningRoom area which is perfect for bringing the kids, especially when the adults would like to hang out for a while, but the kids don't have the attention span to do so
all of the Food i have had here (mostly F_FoodItem) is excellent and the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and good
definitely an once/month spot for us and would be more if we lived closer
i asked for light mustard and delvin over did it
i asked him to take some of it off and he looked at it like how? i just told him take of the first layer and he did with his glove n it got messy
then he stick his hands in the F_Ingredients with the same glove full of mustard
smh! then he tells me i have to ask for light mustard i said excuse me? yes i did you didn't hear me
i consistently have a good O_Experience when i come here
the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Experience/quick and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive, Food is good (edamame!) and overall good Restaurant
we frequent this place when we want to have a decently F_FI_Healthy Food
F_FoodItem bowl with F_FoodItem is straightforward and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
plus, they always have coupons!

for the W_Price
you can do much better
the Food was good and the A_Plc_DiningRoom was elegant, with amazing Service
i think of it as a good date Restaurant if you have money to blow and want to try to impress someone
there are plenty of better places to go in vegas
since its in a casino, they don't seem to have a dress code, despite its the kind of place you would expect to have one
the Restaurant was nearly empty when we walked in
perhaps that was a clue that we should not have stayed
had a solo dinner here at the A_Plc_Bar while in town for business
first plus, the S_Staff steered me away from a bad F_Drinks
redirected to the drunken sailor, i was a very happy camper after a long day of meetings
i followed it up with the F_FoodItem/peach F_Drinks and was even happier
i am a huge F_Drinks fan (and make a darn good one)
i usually do not like F_FI_Taste varieties but this was intriguing
the two conventioneers next to me slugging yuengling(don't get me wrong, i like it, but in a cuban Restaurant?) were also intrigued
F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasty and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
the S_Staff had excellent recommendations on the S_Menu as well
the fire and F_Ingredients seviche was a winner, providing good F_FI_Taste and some nice heat
the F_FoodItem was a nice follow-up but the seviche starred
good Service, good Food and all at a reasonable W_Price
killer Food
i only had one Food out of about 12 things i tried that i didn't like
i love that all of the F_Drinks here is fair trade and organic! this is a P_A_Env_Type/friendly neighborhood Restaurant which is often filled with families and lots of little kids
they also serve some Food type Food including F_FoodItem and cereal as well as somewhat fancier Food
i've had better F_Drinks elsewhere, but they're acceptable here
unfortunately, the S_Wifi is rather hit and miss -- sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but at least it's free
will wait to go a few times before bumping to 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus
but first time was awesome!had to get the lv F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
that F_FoodItem rocks
and the dill relish compliments it ridiculously well
F_FoodItem itself was good, too
paired it w/ some cottage fries w/ cayenne sour cream to dip in and a big cold sprecher root F_Drinks, on tap no less
place has a great looking S_Menu (good selection of creative dogs, sausages, F_FoodItem and sammiches), nice selection of sides (F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem!) and a surprisingly decent F_Drinks selection (for a F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem grill)
plus malts, F_Drinks, etc
and
they have vegetarian options
my girl is vegetarian
want to take her here so she can try a F_Drinks brat! (kinda curious about how a F_FI_Religious brat F_FI_Taste myself
)

had a very poor O_Experience there related to customer Service
arrived to to get seating for a large A_Fur_Table at 12:30pm
they said they would not take names and hold A_Fur_Table
there were limited large A_Fur_Table open at that time, but only two of eight in our party had arrived so they wouldn't A_Fur_Table us
we mentioned our party was expected around 1
around 1 they started a wait list and were not helpful when we asked to be listed on it
S_Staff had not looked to save any large A_Fur_Table or opportunities to hold our group and were very P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude when we asked again to try and be A_Fur_Table
the rest of our party showed by 1:15 and it included 3 kids
at that time, there was nowhere for us to sit
by 2pm, they had not followed up with us at all or tried to be courteous
in fact, S_Staff were very P_S_Stf_Appearance/unprofessional during the entire process
i complained to the management since they "had no idea" about how long it would be to try and S_Del_Time us
while i S_Del_Time for more than an hour, they still made no effort to hold smaller A_Fur_Table open to try and accommodate our party
by just after 2pm we said we were leaving and they seemed shocked
was also very P_O_Experience/frustrated S_Staff did not really try to solve any issues and help us out
i didn't even get to eat there but my co-workers had Food there other days and said their Food were "ok
" they need to improve their approach to S_Seating and customer Service
if they would have been more accommodating we would have been a large party with huge orders
instead, S_Staff ruined our day and their reputation among a large group of potential customers
totally enjoyable, every person that i have taken here is forever a fan of honey pig!the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and bulgogi are sooooooooooooo good!!!

P_A_Env_Type/fun A_Environment and pretty good F_FoodItem
Service was great, we kept having people join our A_Fur_Table and they were very accommodating
i love the brunch here! i've been coming here every other weekend since moving to montreal! the Service is quick and friendly
the S_Seating is casual, and they have a huge variety of chocolates at the front to purchase! i work nearby so i come here often to grab Food, or a chocolate snack
the brunch is only served on weekends! i highly P_O_Experience/recommend it
i would P_O_Experience/come_again and again!Food -  amazing!Service - friendly and quickAmbience - casualWorthiness the money - yes!

my favorite bistro in all of montreal
from the great hors d'oeuvres to the fabulous F_Dessert, this is a spot you just can't afford to miss
located in the french quarter, l'express is a P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant that is lays packed and full of eclectic people
the Food is amazing but be sure to S_Delivery l'ile flottante before they sell out and don't forget the F_FoodItem and F_Drinks to finish off the evening
terrible Service, very pretentious Restaurant
S_Del_Time for my F_Drinks for 20 min once and in the end it turned out they forgot ! sold me a day P_F_FI_Quality/old F_FoodItem
my wife and i first went to the location on rea road twice and F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic both times! we came to this Restaurant because it's closer to us and because it's a chain, we thought the Food would be just as good as the one on rea road
we were severely P_O_Experience/disappointed
it an okay place to go for pho
nothing "wow" factor
they're portions was more F_FoodItem and not enough F_FoodItem
not to mention very little herbs given

as i've always wanted to go here, my fiancé P_O_Experience/surprised me by taking me the the witchery for my birthday this evening
maybe i came in with incredibly high expectations but i found that the hype of this place far outweighs what you get
i was not particularly O_Experience with any Food i received, to be completely honest
while the Restaurant is not "bad" by any means, it seems as though it's coasting on a name, rather than the F_FI_Quality of the Food
the witchery seems to do Food that is very classic, which is great if that's what you're looking for
however, i was expecting the classic Food to have something which set it apart from other Restaurant like it
in short, i saw nothing like that and was served a few fancy looking Food that were not nearly the calibre of Food i would expect from a place this "legendary" or in such a O_Pay_Price point
i have eaten at several world class Restaurant and have experienced better Food at a fraction of the O_Pay_Price in more cosmopolitan hubs (vegas, nyc, etc)
not only that, but i found the Service to be dismal overall
the S_Staff were very P_S_Stf_Behavior/kind but not P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive enough
i recognize that there can be a cultural divide between american (which i find far too hands on) and british Service but this didn't even begin to straddle the line
we were left to our own devices with only a check in every half hour (if that)
the last straw, which i'm not sure was intentional or not, was that i wasn't asked if i wanted my credit card charge to be in dollars or pounds
for most people this isn't a big deal, but i travel enough to know that establishments make extra money if one O_Payment in foreign currency
i would think a place of this calibre would know exactly what they are doing when hey run something like that, which i find dishonest
the witchery gets extra points for acknowledging and doing something sweet for my birthday but overall, i'd P_O_Experience/recommend people look to other places in edinburgh for great Food
this Restaurant seems like a tourist trap that's lazy bc of their legacy
personally, i felt it was a waste of W_Price
so i've never had vietnamese pho before (pronounced fu, as in fun, without the n) and i decided to try it with a friend of mine who speaks vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to S_Delivery and what i was eating and also steer me to the best Restaurant in town so i'd have a positive initial pho experience and want to P_O_Experience/go_back again and again
unphogettable is tucked into an asian cultural center just south of hibernate street on dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the asian grocery story, but has it's own entrance and A_Plc_DiningRoom
it had a pretty nice A_Environment, the S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (i figured they either eat there quite a bit, or the S_Staff remembers him because he doesn't likely see very many tall, geeky, white kids who speak vietnamese)
the S_Menu had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are
the S_Staff offered to go over the S_Menu with us, since it was our first time, but my friend told him that he would handle it
the Restaurant was pretty clean and the S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful
my only minor complaint was that there was a minor F_FoodItem odor in the A_Env_AC, but i wasn't quite sure if it was the Restaurant's F_FoodItem or the adjoining asian grocery store that had the fishy smell
either way it wasn't overpowering and didn't detract from our Food at all
i S_Delivery pho with F_FI_Size sliced F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
i have to admit, that when i looked at the S_Menu, i thought F_FoodItem was F_FoodItem, so i assumed i was S_Delivery F_FI_Size strips of F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem junks
it wasn't until my friend's wife repeated my S_Delivery with an emphasis on tendon that i realized what i S_Delivery
either way though, i'm pretty adventurous so i figured i'd give it a shot
my wife S_Delivery a flat noodle Food instead of the F_FoodItem since she's had it before
the Food didn't take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of pho with all the trimmings
i added a decent amount of hoisen F_Ingredients, and an even more decent amount of F_Ingredients
the broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red
i added in my F_FoodItem sprouts, tore up my F_FoodItem and plopped in my jalapeños to boot
i dug in and was amazed at how great F_FoodItem tasted
i wasn't really amazed that it tasted good, but that it tasted so good and i'd never had it before
why had people kept this a secret from me? F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic and right up my alley
F_FoodItem, hot sauce and F_FoodItem
i wolfed mine down and even tried my wife's noodle Food, not really enough to give a thorough review, but it was good, and i'd try it again
the W_Price weren't bad, i ended up O_Payment about $22 for the two of us to eat our Food and a small F_Appetizer split between 4 people
range: $7
50 - $12
00
sorry for posting without pictures, but i'm sure i'll be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl
because of this Restaurant, i am now a fan of Food, specifically the F_FoodItem

this will be my first visit to a korean F_FoodItem joint here in vegas and i was delightfully P_O_Experience/surprised
it was fairly traditional with a decent selection (tripe was a nice addition)
the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive as they needed to be; quick to switch out grill tops and refill F_Drinks, but that is rarely a deal-breaker for me at these places
to explain to those that may have been to different style korean F_FoodItem's, this is the type that is Food style, not the dim sum style
i typically compare korean Restaurant on their kalbi, and this place stacks up right around the 3 O_Exp_StarsByCus range
having been to, in my opinion, some of the best domestic korean F_FoodItem's back in queens, ny, this place filled the void rather nicely
i'll definitely return for my monthly dose of pig intestine, and for 18$ a head? gun bae!

i came upon paradise bakery by chance and just stopped by to have a F_Drinks and something sweet
we S_Delivery a F_Dessert, F_Dessert, and a F_Dessert
F_FoodItem were all okay, but not P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic
i think F_FoodItem a little P_F_FI_Price/pricey for what it is
the A_Plc_DiningRoom was pretty nice and seemed like a nice Restaurant to study or read, but i probably wouldn't choose to P_O_Experience/go_back
this a great deli, by airports standards or otherwise
they have a fairly S_Menu S_Menu, but the Food is great F_FI_Quality
there are F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem
Service is always friendly and prompt, which is great when you're rushing to a flight
try the F_FoodItem and cranberry F_FoodItem, it is great! this is my go to for a quick Food before heading to the security line
Food and Service were good but apparently they didn't want to O_Payment the rent
place is closed, locked up with a sign saying the lien holder has taken over
guess i have to find a new F_FoodItem place now
damnit
went here to break passover this yearwhat we sampled: F_Drinks sampler      definitely a good way to try different F_Drinks, to get an idea of what you like
i was really interested in the hefeweizen with F_FI_Taste of banana and clove
it was definitely interesting smelled like bananas and F_FI_Taste like cloves
F_Appetizer sample     the F_Drinks F_FoodItem and pretzels were great and the F_FoodItem were definitely interesting
i wasn't such a big fan of the F_FoodItem though
F_Drinks F_FoodItem spatzel     total winner of the night
it was awesome
apple streudel     a classic, though i don't know if i would S_Delivery it again
not really my thing
Service was great and helpful!

good F_FoodItem
i had the F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
F_FI_Taste good a little on the spicey side
kind of small could've been bigger
good  Service
good P_O_Pay_Price/cheap F_FoodItem, but like a previous comment, it gets harder and harder to keep going back
the way they process S_Delivery is annoying, but that's not a deal-breaker if the Food is W_Price it
i've S_Delivery Food F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem for Food mostly
F_FoodItem W_Price extra
the F_FoodItem isn't remarkable
overall the Food is just okay - good enough to stop by if it's on the way to somewhere else - not good enough to make a trip specifically to dine there
i was really P_O_Experience/unimpressed
they get a weak 3 based mainly on the Service which was the strong point of the visit this morning
arriving about 8 on a thursday morning the Restaurant was about full
given the choice between a booth and the counter i chose a booth
S_Delivery decaf which there was afresh pot brewing and it came in a few S_Del_Time
S_Delivery the country Food (normally $5
99 but was the daily special at $4
99) with 2 F_FoodItem, a split biscuit with gravy and 2 slices of F_Ingredients
the F_Appetizer were ok
i prefer a sausage gravy rather than the pepper gravy they make but it was ok
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasty but P_F_FI_Size/thin and not lean
the F_FoodItem were runny in the middle
the building and A_Decor was showing a lot of wear
there ware a lot of regulars even after the morning rush of folks heading off to work
the Service was really good and friendly
overall this Restaurant was a reasonable value in that you could get a Food at fast Food O_Pay_Price with wait Service
not sure i would make it part of a regular rotation but i may stop again because of where it is in relation to where i travel
i used to think sephora was my "happy place," but that was until i went to hough's
hough's is my happy Restaurant, and also you can't F_Drinks a F_Drinks at sephora
so
many
F_Drinks!  at reasonable W_Price!!!  every time i leave the sharp edge i feel like i've left the bulk of my personal wealth there
not at hough's!  it's everything that's good about the sharp edge, and you're not going to go broke
i also really liked that the F_Drinks list was seperated by brewery, bc i am a F_Drinks snob
not a fan of dogfish, but i do love my troeg's
i also really liked that on the back of the F_Drinks S_Menu they offer descriptions of each of the different F_Drinks so you can sound like you know what the hell you are talking about when discussing the random F_Drinks you've just S_Delivery
"i like the fruity finish of this kolsch
i believe this brewery is from a small basement in a small upstate newyork town you've never heard of!"pro tip:  it's winter
S_Delivery a black ipa or a winter warmer, don't S_Delivery a kolsch
ever
they are just not good
my current favorite F_Drinks at hough's is 21st ammendment fireside chat
try it
you'll love it
F_Drinks is my "thing" and i know what's up
you'll like it, trust me
i had a lot of F_Drinks
they were good
the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledgeable, and according to my friend (a S_Staff), she was also hot
he appreciated that
the only thing i didn't like was the cold F_Drinks F_FoodItem dip
there are certain Food i call, "guy Food
"  stuff S_Staff love and chicks are grossed out by
this was one of them, bc my friend ate the whole thing while i poked at it and said, "is this just a block of cream F_FoodItem with shredded F_FoodItem mixed in?"  i'm pretty sure it was
but my friend loved it
i'll def P_O_Experience/be_back, and you should go there too!

ate here on our trip to vegas last year using a Restaurant
com certificate
gotta love the Restaurant that let you include liquor the coupon
we each had a P_F_FI_Size/large F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and not weak
we shared the F_FoodItem that were excellent
shared a couple other F_Appetizer that also hit the mark well
a bit small of a space and you get to know your neighbors well
great deal with the certificate
well call me sheila and throw another F_FoodItem on that barbie
ok, so there's no australian connection to treacle, but the king prawn noodle box i had here today was by far the best F_FoodItem, and the best ever F_FoodItem, i've ever had
we're talking about all my culinary O_Experience internationally here, and i've done all the whole F_FoodItem scene ample times
the F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste like F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh off the barbie, really charred and P_F_FI_Taste/flavoursome and juicy and mmm
seriously, just
if you like prawns, go and S_Delivery that Food
i want another one now, and i only had it 3 hours ago
as far as noodle Food go it was better than any chinese takeaway i've had too
so, as far as my O_Experience of treacle goes, it's a pub and a gastro-pub, the Food is exceptional
the S_Menu doesn't give that away
it has the standard pies, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, open F_FoodItem etc
and doesn't seem to hint that it'll be anything other than good pub Food
but ohmylord
everything i've had here has just been exceptionally well F_FI_CookingLevel
the S_Staff deserves every single one of these 5 sexy O_Exp_StarsByCus
i can't P_O_Experience/recommend it highly enough for delicious pub grub
read my other reviews of it previously for an idea of the place
i am now definitely one of its biggest fans
this is one of my all time favorite Restaurant near my work
my girlfriend introduced this place to me a few months ago when i was craving viet Food
she encouraged me to try the bahn mi F_FoodItem
i immediately fell in love
as i got to explore the S_Menu
i quickly found this spot to have some the best pho i've ever had
from living in california to now recently residing in vegas
the rare F_FoodItem is awesome especially when you get it served on the side instead of already mixed in the broth allows you to drop in at your leisure to get soft "rare" slices of F_FoodItem
F_FI_Quality F_FoodItem
very P_F_FI_Taste/flavourful!
great cure for hangovers! i really enjoy the F_FoodItem Food and the F_FoodItem are amazing (always P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh)
the peanut dipping F_Ingredients for the F_FoodItem is definitely on point and is a must try if you eat here
also the W_Price are very reasonable and just a great Restaurant for friends and A_Env_Type to get good local Food!

i was really P_O_Experience/impressed with the F_FI_Quality of Food at sage garden! they catered a meeting for us and  i thought their Food really stood out:they came in (on time) and set it all up for us in a timely/professional manner (as it was a working Food)F_FoodItem- excellent, i had F_FoodItem & swiss although they had F_FoodItem, ham, and i believe F_FoodItem to choose from
they were all served on soft croissant F_FoodItem
a veg option would have been great and some individual mustard/mayo's rather than a large one for all to share ( the germaphobe in me would have appreciated it
)they provided F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! red F_Ingredients, green F_Ingredients, mayo -based, non-sweet, with almost a hint of F_Ingredients
F_FoodItem was really good
they also gave us some incredible chocolate brownies, which were just so good i wish i grabbed one more before i left
overall the Food was really P_F_FI_Taste/delicious- they were a step above many of the other franchised Food
P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, just the way i like my lunch to be : ) i'd highly P_O_Experience/recommend them
of wolfley and man! (metallica reference!)i came here for Food with an associate and i wanted to try something new
wolfley's was definitely something you can't find anywhere in the country so what the hey! i would have S_Delivery their hometown favorite F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, but the S_Staff warned me F_FoodItem was quite P_F_FI_Healthy/salty
i'm glad she did since i don't take kindly on overly P_F_FI_Healthy/salty Food
so i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem sliders instead
let's just say i wasn't sure if should have sucked it up and tried the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem instead
sliders were, well sub par and basic
F_FoodItem was pretty P_F_FI_Quality/dry and it came along with some F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem flakes
i needed to douse it with some ketchup to help me swallow it
my Food also came along with a side F_FoodItem, which was probably the better of the two
however, i found a few brown leaves and tried to work around it
Service was good overall and the Restaurant was pretty well put together
definitely a cool Restaurant to hang with the boys for a game
i went on wolfey's website and notice they are fond of charitable work and non-profits coming to their place - kudos! then again in my honest opinion i'm not sure i would want to P_O_Experience/recommend this place unless it's just for F_Drinks
- enjoy!

the strip mall exterior belies the treasure within! when you enter, you're immediately S_Stf_Behavior by the smell of F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem
normally the smell of F_FoodItem is not a pleasant one for me
as in, makes me lose my appetite
so, it's a huge compliment when i say, the smells coming out of the open A_Plc_Kitchen are mouthwatering
when one of my dining companions received her F_FoodItem, there were yet more mouthwatering aromas
wth kind of alchemy is going on in that A_Plc_Kitchen make this vegetarian salivate over dead animal? no matter, fellow lovers of the plant plate, there's options for you here
for starters, you *must* S_Delivery the brussels sprouts (they do come with panchetta, but it can be left off)
dievine
seriously
as are the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted root F_FoodItem
i love when something simple is so delicious
i normally never eat mac and F_FoodItem because it's so two-note (duh), but beckett's A_Fur_Table makes it so that i finally *get* why people are all gaga over this stuff
it's very subtle, but those mustard seeds take the Food to a whole other level of delish bliss
my Food, the oven P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem tower was probably the least exciting thing i ate last night night, but still flavorful in its own right and beautifully plated
i'm just not a fan of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem which comprise about half of the stack
i'll leave this tiny meh at that, because the entire O_Experience blows that away into the ether
next up, F_Dessert
although thoroughly stuffed at this point, i managed a bite of the sweet F_FoodItem (incredible), the F_FoodItem (delightfully tart, balanced with a sweet F_Dessert) and the piéce de resistance, fig (yes, i said fig) and F_FoodItem
i'd be remiss to not mention the F_FoodItem list, which seemed quite creative
it was hard for me to choose, but i had the az farmhand, which has hendricks gin, F_Drinks, ginger, F_Drinks and honey, many of my favorite F_FoodItem F_Ingredients
it did not P_O_Experience/disappoint
fabulous selection of wines by the glass, too
a thoroughly lovely O_Experience from start to finish, beckett's A_Fur_Table provides top notch Food at affordable O_Pay_Price, with impeccable Service in a rustic A_Environment (you feel like you're in the hippest, coziest lodge)
too bad the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, because the Service was terrible
when i S_Delivery my F_FoodItem + F_FoodItem ball (which was alright but not W_Price $5
99) i asked for it in the plastic container to go, i was argued with, being told the paper like container was more safe and better for F_FoodItem
it promptly spilled because the lid wasn't tight enough, and in my car
this Restaurant looks amazing when you walk in and feel like you have entered a 70's Food
then the longer you spend there the less amazing it became
the Service is terrible and it took forever to get our Food
i made my own F_FoodItem but found the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem has no seasoning at all, just F_FoodItem made into a patty and F_FI_CookingLevel
the F_Appetizer were not bad but the mac and F_FoodItem was O_Experience at all,  one F_Appetizer was enough for me
the F_Dessert looked good but i am sure it was like most of the stuff in this place
looks great but leaves a bad F_FI_Taste in your mouth
we initially wanted to go to wicked spoon for the Food, but they were about to close to prepare for dinner
we saw holsteins along the way and decided to check it out
we both got the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, which was okay
my son P_O_Experience/enjoyed the F_FoodItem and F_Appetizer
the Food was decent, but maybe a bit P_F_FI_Price/overpriced, mostly likely due to it's A_LocatedArea in the cosmo
our S_Staff was fantastic and really catered to our kids needs
S_Delivery a F_FoodItem/F_FoodItem Food and it was pretty much all F_FoodItem and barely any F_FoodItem
my boyfriend got sick from the F_FoodItem he had
won't P_O_Experience/go_back
this was hands down the best Food i had during my recent trip to phoenix
our S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful - walking us through the S_Menu, making suggestions, and just being overall very pleasant
my husband and i started with the pF_FoodItem, F_FoodItem was tender and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
we scarfed down the whole thing
for entrees, i went with the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem were nicely prepared, but i could have eaten a whole bowl of just the F_FoodItem with F_Ingredients
mm - so so good
my husband had the F_FoodItem which were definitely the right way to go
F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
and, even though we were both too full to move, i really wanted to try the F_Dessert, so we went for it
so
W_Price
it
the only unfortunate thing was that at 8:00 on the sunday night before columbus day, the Restaurant was pretty much empty
i would have expected more of a crowd - it felt a little
i don't know
not happening
but, despite the lack of a crowd, this place stands on its Food and Service and i will definitely P_O_Experience/be_back the next time i'm in az

amazing little wine A_Plc_Bar! they have some seriously wonderful F_Appetizer
you can't go wrong with the F_FoodItem board, the F_FoodItem, the F_FoodItem, or the F_FoodItem
they're all to die for! oh, the F_FoodItem are great too! i wasn't thrilled with the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem to be honest, but that was my only P_O_Experience/disappointment
one more thing i was simply so bummed about was they discontinued the rock F_FoodItem and that was my favorite
i still ask every time i go in just to see if they will bring it back
:) you just cannot beat the wine and F_Drinks selection, the P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Food, and the great Ambience
this is a must try!

i was driving down buffalo and came across this place
boy am i glad i stopped by
omg! this place is the bomb diggity! never expected the Food to be so P_F_FI_Taste/delicious!  it's like an explosion of F_FI_Taste in your mouth! the red F_FoodItem is to die for
i'm from hawaii so it was a surprise to see hawaiian Food served here
to all the hawaiians in las vegas this place give cinnamons Restaurant hard rubs! plus they serve zippy's chilli here!!! i tried the F_FoodItem and the F_FoodItem! a+ in my books!the S_Staff was wonderful! very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and very P_S_Stf_Behavior/prompt
S_Staff filled our F_Drinks when needed and provided a smile every time they came by
i know this is random but their F_Drinks was so good! very cold and F_FI_Taste fresh! that is also a plus for me when checking out a new Restaurant as you know you don't always want to get F_Drinks
so rest assured if you want F_Drinks here your gonna have a good one
W_Price is very reasonable for the F_FI_Taste your are going to receive
the F_FoodItem are more than decent to get you full and possible end up taking some to go!i had a great O_Experience as a first timer
i don't live next to this area but with the results of having a P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff, amazing Food, and decent O_Pay_Price i will not hesitate to take a drive to eat here again!

first visit to emzy last weekend and my wife and i loved the F_FoodItem! it was a little weird when we arrived around 7:45 on a saturday night and the Restaurant was dead
i was worried the Food might not be good, but i have to say that everything was great! we both eat F_FoodItem all the time and we had some of the best F_FoodItem here at emzy
i am not sure why the place was packed out with patrons
the Ambience is trendy and cool, the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and the Food great
i have to assume that the location, not near trade and tryon or the epicenter, are the only reason Restaurant was mostly A_Env_Type
well, that is a shame
if you like F_FoodItem, this place is not to be missed
we loved the drunken F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, and especially loved the sweet 18 F_FoodItem! F_FoodItem's a bit P_F_FI_Price/pricey at $16, but the sweet 18 was W_Price every W_Price! the P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem ball small plate was excellent as well
if you're a fan of F_FoodItem, i would P_O_Experience/recommend emzy for sure!

i got the three F_FI_Taste F_FoodItem on my first time here
the F_FI_Taste was just wonderful
this is the 3rd location i've tried out
pita jungle does not P_O_Experience/disappoint! everything about their Food is consistent
the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
i wish we had these Restaurant in florida
O_Exp_StarsByCus!

i am a native phoenician and mexican american
i was shocked to find this Restaurant serving such authentic mexican Food
it was similar to my mother's cooking
try the seafood with mojo de ajo (F_FoodItem F_Ingredients)
they added peanut F_Ingredients to the mojo de ajo and this was truly a delicacy know  to very few locals
try the dos amigos (prawns and F_FoodItem) - $13
25
the F_FI_CookingLevel are the 2 S_Staff  man and wife
beautiful A_Decor and very P_S_Stf_Appearance/pleasant young S_Staff/S_Staff12-29-12  looking forward to 2013

amazing pulled F_FoodItem! the F_FoodItem was charred and F_FI_Taste just right
the sides are huge portions
the F_FoodItem was pretty P_F_FI_Taste/tasty but not enough F_FoodItem! more F_FoodItem and it's just right
45 S_Del_Time for P_F_FI_CookingLevel/undercooked F_FoodItem (so called tiger F_FoodItem F_FoodItem) F_FoodItem platter came with plastic wrap around pieces of F_FoodItem my favorite F_Drinks had literally 10% of liquor and the rest was F_Ingredients
wanted to impress my boyfriend with some classy Food, so i did!

favorite F_FoodItem in charlotte
if i hadn't lived in chicago previously, i might say my favorite F_FoodItem Restaurant ever
i love the A_Environment both inside and out, but you can't beat the rooftop deck
with this building's bad reputation for keeping tenants, i hope jj's can make it for the long haul
i'm a big fan
the F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar must be doing something right, since it was crowded
the Food was acceptable, but not exceptional
the F_FoodItem S_Delivery (maple F_Ingredients and tiramisu) were F_FoodItem with topping on top, not wrapped within as one normally does for a F_FoodItem
we waited 20 S_Del_Time or so for the F_FoodItem to come out, and the presentation of the F_FoodItem seemed rushed--toppings were just sort of dumped on top of the folded F_FoodItem, like it was prepared by someone in a rush
i suspect they did not have a A_Plc_Kitchen floorspace or S_Staff adequate to meet demand
the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and considerate and the A_Decor was pleasant
while not terrible, it was not really Worthiness the W_Waiting or the W_Price
i doubt i will P_O_Experience/go_back
bacchanal Food is located at ceasars palace
i'm a victim of expecting a grand feast from this mega Food, only to have my expectations shattered like a huge mirror hitting a concrete floor
fellow yelpers raved about it
family and friends that had gone, had also raved about it
so naturally i bookmarked it and anxiously awaited my time to feast like a king at the Food of all F_FoodItem
"upon arriving at the entrance to the Food it was already clear that we came during the dinner rush
the line was insanely long
fast forward 1
5 hours later and we were finally A_Fur_Table inside
oh yes, it took us 1
5 hours of waiting & $50+ per person to get in
the place is freaking huge
Food on Food on Food & A_Fur_Table on A_Fur_Table on A_Fur_Table
the A_Decor was pretty and oozed of opulence for a Food
we were A_Fur_Table relatively close to the F_Dessert station
the entire Food was a blur, there was a lot to choose from (F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, ethnic Food, F_Dessert, sides, F_FoodItem, soups, etc) and yet nothing specific comes to mind about what was the best at that Food
however, i did enjoy the crab legs and the choice of either cold crab legs or boiled crab legs; which were boiled fresh upon each S_Delivery
the only thing i didn't like about bacchanal was the Food set up
the majority of the Food stations and the F_Dessert station were located in the same room; but the crab legs and the majority of the asian Food and F_FoodItem Food were located in a separate room
i suppose this is my Food pet peeve and the worst offender is the Food at mandalay bay, where the majority of each Food station is sectioned off in its own space@!&$# lol i digress
i'm pretty sure the long wait left a bad F_FI_Taste in my mouth making my expectation of the bacchanal that much more important
would i P_O_Experience/come_back to bacchanal? yes, to give it another shot, but will need to time my next visit so it doesn't coincide during the rush -_-

we had tickets to the mercury game and were trying to get away from the crowds when we stumbled upon this amazing P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant!we both had chubby F_FoodItem with ranch F_Ingredients and F_FoodItem
i also S_Delivery an oreo F_Drinks
prepare to be wowed
i don't know what it is about this F_FoodItem, but it is an O_Experience to eat it
plenty of F_Ingredients mixed with the P_F_FI_Healthy/freshness of the F_FoodItem and soft F_FI_CookingLevel whole grain F_FoodItem
well it's just indescribable and also very affordable!you need to visit soon!

decided to go here instead of my normal chipotle fix
i had the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem club
,it was loaded with F_Ingredients and F_FoodItem but definitely not eat
just a few slices of each and maybe F_FoodItem
it was hard to tell under all he F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was really P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, seemed P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh! the  F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and a F_Drinks was just over $9
a bit P_F_FI_Price/pricey for what you get
there are some other F_FoodItem shops motto far from here that have better Food at a better W_Price
it seems this store just opened
the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and the Food is prepared super fast
i will give it another trying few weeks to see if this was just a new opening hiccup
we just came from having the best F_FoodItem we have ever eaten
we had the F_FoodItem and added F_FoodItem
unbelievably P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, artisan style and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
it was wonderful
the S_Staff/S_Staff and entire S_Staff made their way over to our A_Fur_Table just to S_Stf_Behavior us
they sell homemade french F_FoodItem and rosemary/kalamata F_FoodItem french F_FoodItem
took two loaves home
don't listen to one word negative about the Restaurant, Service or Food
it really was delightful
fyi:  to lenne o from denver
you must have been in the F_FoodItem Restaurant across the S_Parking lot because 1)you do not serve your own beverage  2) there isn't a chalkboard and 3) you don't prepay or pre-tip
none of that
the F_FoodItem here was average
i went with a healthier option on the S_Menu and did not get my F_FoodItem F_FI_CookingLevel, i got the kabobs
there was nothing special about the Food but the F_FoodItem were F_FI_CookingLevel properly
i would go back here and try something different
also great A_Decor from forest gump!!!

you'll feel like you're eating in a havana bistro with a cuba libre on the side and expect a hand F_FoodItem cuban cigar to follow your Food under palm trees
which leaves one massive mystery: i've never seen a cuban cooking, serving, waiting the A_Plc_Bar, or eating there
i'm not sure a cuban has ever so much as walked by saluds door
yet, magically, it F_FI_Taste like everything was teleported over from fidel castro's personal S_Staff right to your pittsburgh plate
incredibly P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh Food, high on F_FI_Taste and F_FI_Quality
the Service was genuine and warm, and the S_Staff even offered us holiday cookies his wife made as a F_Dessert for free just to be friendly
the A_Environment is totally standard lawrenceville/pittsburgh A_Plc_Bar, and has no hint of the cuban F_FI_Taste that is conjured up in their A_Plc_Kitchen
they have a solid craft brew list with a F_FI_Size number of rotating bottles and drafts, and reasonable W_Price across the board
i'd love to see the A_Environment match the excellent cuban Food and strong Service, but i'd gladly come back either way
for great cuban Food at great O_Pay_Price, salud, i salute you!

i decided to come here after driving past it so many times
the first thing i noticed was their dull S_Menu, no creativity what so ever
i'm a graphic designer so for me precentation means a lot
anyway, i S_Delivery a F_FoodItem and an F_FoodItem
i was the only one there, and it took them a good five minutes to prepare them
not only that, they messed up my S_Delivery, they gave me a F_FoodItem instead of tripa
very P_O_Experience/disappointed
if i ever P_O_Experience/come_back i'll know what to expect
i really wanted to love this Restaurant
especially from the good reviews and because we drove from henderson just to go and eat here (about 45 minute drive)
we went for brunch on a sunday and it did not seem too busy
there were plenty of A_Fur_Table available and there was a small line to S_Delivery
they take your S_Delivery at one counter and then you wait in line to O_Payment for your S_Delivery at another counter
we S_Delivery and then stood in line for about 15 minutes before we could even O_Payment for the S_Delivery
the set up is just not expeditious in any way
we got a A_Fur_Table and waited for our Food
there were four of us; 2 people in our party received their S_Delivery in about 35 S_Del_Time
the other 2 received their S_Delivery in about 50 S_Del_Time
which was over an S_Del_Time from when we first made our S_Delivery
we S_Delivery a benedict and a 3 F_FoodItem (total)
so over an hour seems completely unacceptable to me for such a small and simple S_Delivery
the pulled F_FoodItem benedict was good and the F_FoodItem was nicely F_FI_Taste but their cuban F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/flavorless
i was so hoping that it would be good enough for the hour plus wait
but i was really P_O_Experience/disappointed
we also S_Delivery a side of potatoes
but F_FoodItem was a small plate of about 10 P_F_FI_Size/thin, P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem
the portion was really small for a O_Payment side S_Delivery and they were also meh
nothing special and no seasonings or herbs at all
to be honest, i would not make the trip across town again with so many better options
my wife and i just happened to be at starbucks when we decide to try Restaurant
once arriving we were A_Fur_Table very quickly
unfortunately it was at a A_Fur_Table that hadn't  been cleaned (kinda gross if you'd ask me) which shows a lack of communication between who ever is cleaning the A_Fur_Table and who ever is sitting them (or they couldn't care less where they sat my wife and i)
the A_Fur_Table and chairs are booth style so it was a bit uncomfortable for me
the S_Staff was very nice and P_S_Stf_Behavior/greeted us very warmly
unfortunately (and i might attribute this to a busy night on his end) we weren't really told about the S_Menu
once the S_Staff left my wife and i felt as if we knew nothing more about Restaurant then when we sat down, this could have been excused if this places had been open for a couple of months but this was the third night it was opened
all in all the Food was great it came out quick and hot and the S_Staff seemed to have adjusted better and was P_S_Stf_Availability/accessible more and more throughout our Food
i P_O_Experience/recommend the F_FoodItem guild the Food was great at the Ambience is killer and i'm very excited to see if there are any sports nights or weekends coming up at Restaurant
if you're a selective eater please make sure to ask questions (next time i'll take my own advice as well)
please see below for a personal side note
*the Food went fine and i seldom felt a i need to call my S_Staff over
as we were leaving a man which i presumed worked there (he was standing around looking at the A_Fur_Table and standing with the host and what i assumed to be the S_Staff
or maybe he was the S_Staff) went to the door and held it open
what i hadn't realized was that he was holding it open for a couple (white and in there 50's maybe) coming in and not for my wife and i (hispanic and white respectably) which were going out
the man after noticing my wife and i motioning towards the door continues to motion the couple which was entering to come in
awkward at best this situation left a poor F_FI_Taste in my mouth
great F_FoodItem but bad Service
sat at the A_Plc_Bar and pretty much had the S_Menu thrown at me
it took about ten minutes for the A_Plc_Bar tender to notice me after i had a chance to review the S_Menu
it was my first time there and probably my last
sucks because i was really excited about going there
back already!  my husband had the really F_FoodItem, and i had a F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
i must admit, the F_FoodItem was really P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
spicy, but not overpowering
the F_FoodItem was not really that P_F_FI_Taste/spicy, they say all their F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/spicy
next time, i'll get the F_FoodItem too
good Food, smiling Service, clean Restaurant
i have to admit, i wasn't particularly adventurous with my S_Delivery when i ate here last week
we arrived around 12:30 and the A_Environment was pretty P_A_Env_Type/busy
they are still offering their regular F_FoodItem for 50% off so i got a few off the S_Menu to try
my dining companion S_Delivery the Food special, which was also a pretty good deal
the F_FoodItem was all pretty P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and the F_FoodItem were made well
i would have given them O_Exp_StarsByCus if Service was a bit better
i know they were a little busy, but F_Drinks went unfilled and our Food came out slow
their ayce W_Price were reasonable and i have a groupon burning a hole in my pocket, so i will P_O_Experience/be_back
looking forward to trying more items off the S_Menu
both the F_FoodItem and cooked items look enticing
the S_Staff are extremely nice and the Food is quite P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
nice, authentic, and a great F_FI_Taste of the middle east
this place absolutely lives up to its O_Exp_StarsByCus! amazing Food, amazing Service, and adorable pens shaped like chopsticks holding nigiri :p the special with sea bass and F_Ingredients salt was my favorite, but the trout with pop rocks and the tadas were amazing too
Food we has was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
but whatever you do, don't ask for louis
he's mine!

i've been to pomo for several company outings and for dinner dates
the F_FI_Quality of Service and Food never wavers whether i'm there with two people or twenty - it is always an excellent visit with P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledgable S_Staff and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem
any of the F_FoodItem they offer on the S_Menu are absolutely P_F_FI_Taste/delicious as well, i wouldn't hesitate trying a new option here at all
definitely Worthiness a visit, don't miss the A_Plc_Patio in cooler weather!

P_S_Stf_Appearance/clean and P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff
had the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
overall, P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, would P_O_Experience/recommend to an out of towner as a safe bet
hits the pho craving you just have to add your own spices/sriracha
love this Restaurant!!! they have lots of gluten free options and i think they are O_Pay_Price well! i go in at least once a week for their broccoli and F_FoodItem soup!! it's the best i have ever had!! and i alway have great Service!

this place might become my new go to A_Plc_Bar
i went in for the first time since the remodel and was extremely P_O_Experience/impressed
the whole A_Environment feels wry opened and bright and clean
with the number of A_Ent_Tv they have all around the A_Plc_Bar this is a great place to watch football
the Service was great, our S_Staff knew the S_Menu well and gave us some great recommendations
we S_Delivery pretzels to start and i got the F_FoodItem F_Ingredients cesar melt
Food came out fast and F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
i'll definitely P_O_Experience/be_back here
i've travel 52 weeks per year
i grew up in pittsburgh, lived in chicago for 5 years came back this year
been to italy, new york
fiori's is the best
F_Ingredients is great, F_FoodItem is great, Service is always friendly and entertaining
i have been going Restaurant for 20 years
after driving by everyday for months i finally stopped in for a F_FoodItem and was O_Experience
even though the shop was nearly empty, the S_Staff was indifferent and they forgot what i ordered multiple times
the F_FoodItem i ordered was a hot bland mess
instead of F_Ingredients inside, it had plain unseasoned chicken slices which was covered in F_FoodItem and a F_Ingredients one step away from F_Ingredients
to top it all off the F_FoodItem was F_FI_CookingLevel, which made the inside insanely hot and turned to F_FoodItem to rubber
maybe their F_FI_Size F_FoodItem are better, but the next time i spend W_Price10 on a F_FoodItem and F_Drinks, it definitely won't be here
the A_Environment, perfectly reasonable
A_LocatedArea is convenient, especially if you're catching a flick nearby
the Food here is about what you'd expect: not stellar, but not horrible either
Food on the P_F_FI_Price/pricey side, but you probably know that already
it takes W_Price to keep the engine running
what is really bad is the Service
well, that's not entirely true
the Service is actually friendly - very much so, in fact
they S_Stf_Behavior you, and seat you fairly promptly (at the appropriate times), keep your F_Drinks filled, clear S_Cutlery, just about everything
but the wait for the Food is absolutely ridiculous
not one of those "where is the Food" moments, but about ten of them, back to back, and it's not just when they are busy - even when the place is empty, it takes forever to be served
it could be blamed on the P_F_FI_Healthy/freshness of the Food, but we're talking even F_Appetizer and fairly simple F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem Food, so this isn't rocket science
or perhaps it is and all those other chinese places just do it better
this is where i had the best F_FoodItem of my life
it is hands down one of the best F_FoodItem houses in the city, in any city
the Service and Food is always amazing, which it should be because it will F_FI_Price you
that is the only down side but you truely get what you O_Payment for at this Restaurant and i believe it is W_Price it everytime
go and enjoy because you will be speaking about it for days, months, and years
seriously =)

always good- the F_FoodItem are generous and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
the veal Food are very F_FI_Religious without being heavy
F_FoodItem , P_F_FI_Size/thin and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
i think this is a great place to meet friends or bring out of towners
i have been a fan of S_Staff nina and her Restaurant for many many years
P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic Food, great Service, A_Ent_LiveShow, locally owned
this is our favorite spot to Restaurant for sure
well, i think i'm one of a hand full of ladies who actually like hooters Restaurant
so my boyfriend took myself and another couple here for my birthday Food , one of my 4 night stay in vegas (@ treasure island)we also wanted to see there casino
not that P_O_Experience/impressed anyway
the Food was okay, the Service was awful, of all the Restaurant i've been to this is the worst by far
and you'd think its be the best since its in there Restaurant/A_Entertainment
not the case
i've been coming Restaurant for about five years and today was my last day
i sat down and pulled out my e-cigarette as i have been doing for the past three years
i ordered a F_Drinks and a S_Menu
i decided on my usual and placed my order
when the S_Staff came back, she said i was not allowed to use my e-cigarette Restaurant
as per the S_Staff, "e-cigarettes are no longer allowed but cigarettes and cigars are
" when i first started coming here, i was a smoker! the Food is great and they have a nice F_Drinks selection
i have nothing against smoke or smokers, obviously because this place has tons of smokers who are usuals
i really liked the place too! the low ceilings combined with the chain smokers makes for a vintage vegas experience that you really can't find much these days
don't try to apply logic here
it really makes no sense
i honestly think someone could get away with smoking a joint in here because Restaurant is that much smoke
make sure you don't bring your electronic cigarette though, you could fill those with F_Ingredients! the ironic part is that Restaurant's a sign out front that says 'A_Plc_SmokingArea
'if the S_Staff banned cigarettes and e-cigarettes, that would somewhat make sense, but i still wouldn't P_O_Experience/go_back
at least he was being consistent
do not go here to watch buckeyes A_Entertainment either, they will yell at you for being loud when you are just cheering
i can't speak for browns A_Entertainment on sunday though
the local A_Plc_Bar is now pt's gold on rainbow anyway and has been for several years now
pros: very smokey, like jazz pool-hall it has that smokey-blue tinge in the right A_Decor
the usuals are all great!the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic!cons:no electronic cigarettes
excellent Food at great W_Price
i hadnt been Restaurant in years but found it again this past weekend and the Food is still just as good as ever and the Food are just as gigantic as ever
also one of the few places that still have F_FoodItem
if you get the F_FoodItem, order them with the F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem for $5
95 are you kidding me, this is 3 Food for me
F_FoodItem takes up the entire S_Cutlery with F_Ingredients F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients
even though F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Size/huge still has good F_FI_Taste, i get the F_FoodItem and it is served wet in the F_Ingredients
also comes with F_FoodItem and has a P_F_FI_Size/small good F_FoodItem
you order at the counter and they call your number to pick up the Food
if you are looking for a fast inexpensive good F_FI_Quality clean Restaurant, this is it, they do live up to their motto "where you don't peso much!"for the F_FI_Price you spend and the Food you get it is a 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus, but 5 star is an over the top Restaurant for me
use to go to the one in glendale, but with work have been coming for Food to the one on bell road
same good Service and Food

F_FI_Quality Food mixed with daily F_Drinks O_Experiences
definitely a Restaurant to check out
my absolute favorite place for Food
unless you are in a large group Restaurant is never more then a 10 minute wait, even on sunday morning when the Restaurant appears to be packed
friendly Service, and the F_FoodItem is to die for
Restaurant have been times i was tempted to stop in just to buy a F_FI_Size of the F_FoodItem to go
the F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Size/huge, consider sharing if you aren't a heavy eater
never had anything other then Food so not sure how the Food is
the Food here is awesome
like, seriously awesome
i've tried several of the Food and haven't had a bad Food yet
also awesome: the S_Staff
i find that here in las vegas its hard to find good Service (which is odd because i would have thought the opposite) so i love coming here to Restaurant in because its always a very pleasant experience
ask for anthony or don they are both fantastic and P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff
the only reason i gave O_Exp_StarsByCus instead of 5 is because their A_Plc_DiningRoom are extremely crowded when busy and it feels very claustrophobic in those situations
it won't stop me from going back though!

i didn't know Restaurant was so many different  F_FoodItem to put on my F_FoodItem, he asked me what kind of F_FoodItem i wanted i was lost i said "philly cheese" lol but on the real i love this place
the corner location scares me with so much speeding traffic i always think about a car or truck crashing into people trying to enjoy this place be safe
F_FI_Size rare ordered
well done received
P_O_Experience/disappointing for a $50 plus F_FoodItem
i don't send Food back to the A_Plc_Kitchen, it frightens me
slice of F_FoodItem will be ordered in a bit
a great steakhouse amongst the excess of options that vegas provides
we arrived at 7 on a thursday and had O_Reservation, though the place was not busy enough to require them
i ordered the filet mignon, F_FI_Size, and my wife ordered the prime rib, also F_FI_Size
both were F_FI_CookingLevel perfectly, and the F_FI_Quality of the F_FoodItem was extremely high
for sides we had the yukon gold puree, very F_FI_Taste, and F_FoodItem, also very F_FI_Taste
they have a great F_Drinks selection, some nice house F_FoodItem (i had the fire and F_Ingredients i believe it was called, a fun mix of F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients), and the Service was great
the only downside was the A_Environment
the entrance is directly from the casino floor, which i tend to like the Restaurant set back more from the crowds, but once we were in the Restaurant our A_Fur_Table was A_Fur_Table far back inside, and it was nice and quiet
overall, a great place to eat for a nice Food with amazing F_FoodItem
would definitely P_O_Experience/go_back

i am a prime F_FoodItem lover! i consider myself an expert in the craft
i have had them all
Restaurant, Restaurant, Restaurant, Restaurant ehhh
none compare to Restaurant! the F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Size/huge and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty! the F_FI_Quality of the F_FoodItem and the A_Environment are second to none! whenever i stay at the hard rock, i make it a point to dine here?by far the best Service!

we went to roy's on the advice of a friend and were P_O_Experience/impressed! the F_Appetizer F_Appetizer was "melt-in-your-mouth" amazing and the F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/yummy!   hard to believe that this is a Restaurant!  the Food was not "F_FI_Taste" and Service was outstanding!

my friend and i stopped here for Food
we were seated immediately, and the S_Staff was very nice and P_S_Stf_Behavior/prompt with F_Drinks refills
they have a huge range of options for Food, and almost everything is made Restaurant, not F_FI_Quality or F_FI_CookingLevel, which is always a plus
i had the Food, and the F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients was amazing
i'd probably go back to this Restaurant for the delicious looking, fluffy F_FoodItem or some homemade pie
nothing out of this world
1/2 of our 10 piece Food was pretty P_F_FI_CookingLevel/burnt and P_F_FI_Size/undersized
the other half of our order was F_FI_CookingLevel properly and we P_O_Experience/enjoyed it
however, the S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Appearance/unprofessional during our visit and spoke to me and other customers as if he was hanging out with his buddies, rather than serving O_Payment customers
pancake Restaurant holds a special place in my heart, i've been here several times and tried the famous F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and lately i've been really in love with their F_FoodItem
they also have P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem
i'm P_O_Experience/surprised people don't like the F_FoodItem because my boyfriend is crazy about them and gets them every time
speaking of my boyfriend, we went here on our first date
to the yelp-er who said that this is where people take their one night stands
almost fell off my A_Furniture laughing at that one
we went back for our 1 year anniversary, we'll be back for number 2
:)my one caution is that yes, it is as ridiculously crowded as everyone says it is, so be prepared to wait or go on an week day
P_A_Env_Type/fun A_Environment for F_FoodItem and a light Food
interesting scene
i really really don't get the hype over nobu
yeah, the A_Decor is beautiful, the presentation of the Food is great, it's always filled with fun people and it's in the hard rock hotel (one of my favorite hotels in vegas)
buuuuuuuuuuut the Food is waaay P_O_Exp_StarsByCus/overrated
i'm japanese so i think i have a pretty good idea of what good Food is
this wasn't it
sorry
still the best Food i've been to
of course, you have to keep in mind that's it's a Food so for the peeps expecting a 3-michelin star experience, you will be P_O_Experience/disappointed
the only complaint i have is that a year later, the wynn Food is still serving the same S_Menu but the Food (and F_Dessert!) are still P_F_FI_Taste/delicious!

i really dont know how people O_Exp_StarsByCus this Food so high
its was $50 for Food because of 18% gratuity2
the F_FoodItem were mostly P_F_FI_Quality/dry, they had F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients at the carving station and F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Quality/dry as can be
tell me how can sausage be dry???3
was not P_O_Experience/impressed with the selection at all, all their F_FoodItem Food said kobe F_FoodItem but who care if it F_FI_Taste bad and plus its F_FoodItem which isn't real F_FoodItem
the F_Dessert was okay, F_Dessert was good 5
so P_O_Exp_StarsByCus/overrated for the W_Price, just a tourist trap6
better going to a sit down Restaurant for the F_FI_Quality of Food
i felt raped by the F_FI_Price to F_FI_Quality
never again do a Food, i always used to love F_FoodItem when i was younger but the F_FI_Price of the F_FoodItem now a days just doesn't justify going to one
better Food and P_F_FI_Price/cheaper at a sit down Restaurant
plus do a free walk around before you decide all F_FoodItem let you do this before buying it
best F_FoodItem around, great A_Environment and excellent Service
could use better F_Drinks Offers but the Food makes up for it
nice place to hang out and have a F_Drinks on, A_Ent_Music, A_Ent_Music with  a A_Entertainment
the S_Staff are awesome! the sig sig is out of this world

this place is absolutely horrible! 1 the Service is just horrible, our S_Staff practically ignored us all night with our F_Drinks empty and we had to ask her multiple times to get refills
2 we ordered our Food and it took forever to come out
i mean like 40 min with only 2 A_Fur_Table next to us and others dancing so that has absolutely no excuse for the A_Plc_Kitchen to be taking so long to make our Food
3 when we try to O_Payment our bill (which was only 38 dollars) i only had a 50 which is relatively close to the O_Payment and our S_Staff said they didnt have change in the drawer, i mean its a 12 dollar change!!! what kind of a restraunt doesnt have 12 dollars change in the cash drawer?!?!? well thats my experience of this place and it was absolutely fucking horrible
i wish i could put zero stars
$24
99 for Food
Food was soso, i expect much better from mandalay bay
the Food here is mediocre
not bad, but not super good
if you're a foodie, you will have to choose wisely
not everything in the Food is good, but you must pick and choose
there are some diamonds in there
my husband and i came here on a friday for Food a few months ago
we had scored bogo tickets for our Food
the Food was a great deal! for the two of us (for a lunch buffet), we O_Payment $23 total
i would definitely P_O_Experience/come_back to this place in a heart beat
the value was phenomenal for the W_Price
but of course for the next time i'd do the same thing, pick out the P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Food (and trust me, there are some- including P_F_FI_Taste/yummy F_FoodItem!) out of the sea of mediocre Food
was turned onto this place by a friend
when you walk in, you get this truck stop, dirty, dingy type of a feel
this has never scared me because most of the times, these places have the best Food! (check out polaris Restaurant behind the rio all-suites hotel and casino! best Food!)sat down and everything appears to be a tad old and run down
but, the Service was pretty decent
you could tell these people aren't corporate, and i don't mind that at all
i ordered the F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem, wet (with F_FoodItem F_Ingredients) and half with hot F_Ingredients and the other F_FI_Size with F_FI_Size
i like my Food hot and this was hot!!! at first i thought i wasn't going to be able to handle, but then i adapted
like i said, i like my Food hot!!the F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste as if it were prepared by someone who knows F_FoodItem, and not by someone trained to F_FI_CookingLevel and emulate it
my overall experience was that even thought it aint the prettiest or cleanest place, the Food more than makes up for it
i say at least give it a shot and judge for yourself
will i eat here again? as dave hester would say
"yuuup!"

the real deal!  great F_FoodItem, true Food A_Environment
can't ask for more
back here again with my monthly ladies' Food group
i ordered the Food: 1 F_FoodItem, F_Appetizer, and a F_Drinks
the F_Appetizer was F_Drinks today, it was loaded with F_Ingredients (F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem and lots of noodles)
the F_Appetizer was good, not too salty
i ordered the F_FoodItem
unfortunately, F_FoodItem is on the extra P_F_FI_Taste/crispy side
the tip of the F_FoodItem was a black and the crust was super P_F_FI_Taste/crispy
i did not attempt to eat the crust, way too hard
it was better last time
the F_Appetizer and nonstop flowing of F_Ingredients F_Drinks was good
the Service is always excellent
this place has the best F_FoodItem! the S_Staff are usually nice & P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful
we live near nellis afb so this place isn't close to us but we come on this side of town just for the F_FoodItem!  wish they would open up a shop over close to us!  that would be awesome! (hint, hint) ;)

omfg diablo Food challenge is not a joke, they use F_Ingredients, warning do not do challenge my tongue, throat, cheek and ears went numb and no i did not finish the 20 F_FoodItem only ate 15 F_FoodItem
winner winner F_FoodItem melt sammich
they use albacore white, F_Ingredients on a F_Ingredients
it was earlicius!!! sorry no pics, scarfed that bad boy down
it was also a really good Food, not gijimbo just right
sure, vegas has some of the best Restaurant in the world
so when you want something fast, W_Price, and easy, shouldn't it still be at the F_FI_Quality you expect? that's what i found at earl of F_FoodItem
not just a F_FI_Size F_FoodItem, but a low W_Price hot P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem
i had the F_FoodItem with F_Ingredients, and it was far more than i expected
it was not the best F_FoodItem i've ever had in my life, but F_FoodItem was absolutely P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, quick, and F_FI_Quality for about $6
if you don't want to blow a ton of money on a quick F_Appetizer to eat and you'd rather spend it in the casino, then grab a F_FoodItem from the earl
this was easily one of the best Food i have ever had, the atmosphere was awesome
just an all around great dining experience
get the F_Dessert for F_Dessert!!!

consistently excellent!  had dinner Restaurant last night and the Service was superior, Food was excellent as well
we come to the A_LocatedArea often and the F_FoodItem is always beautifully presented and the Service is consistent
well done, we will continue to P_O_Experience/come_back!

i visited this little jewel when it first opened and bought six Food to take to a friends Food
i was really P_O_Experience/disappointed and never went back
three years later, looking for a Food place near my home, i stumbled upon scratch again, this time to rave reviews
i decided to give it another chance and get actual Food here and i am so glad that i did! i chose the Food (i will try the F_FoodItem next time)
this is the first place in phoenix/scottsdale to get hollandaise right (they make their own), the poached F_FoodItem were perfection
now, i normally get really irritated at a small side F_FoodItem on a plate of great food as an afterthought
at first, i ignored it and dove into the actual Food that i ordered
i decided to use it as a F_FoodItem but then i couldn't stop eating it! no "afterthought" sides for scratch!  my husband said the hash browns were the best ever and i agree
they are Offers with maybe F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients?  i was full so i had to get my F_Ingredients to go
the F_Dessert is just like butta!!  i would love to keep this little place to myself but it wouldn't be fair to the rest of humanity
everyone at our A_Fur_Table (4 S_Staff) all had different F_Appetizer and F_Appetizer
needless to say, all of us raved about our Food and the S_Staff we had, i believe his name was matt was fantastic with his Service and Service
if i stay at palms again, i would return for sure
i go here frequently because it's only a couple miles from my work and much better than the nearby souper F_FoodItem
i usually order a F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/flavorless and F_FI_Price extra, but without it i'd probably still feel hungry after
i noticed that when i first started going earlier this year they filled the bowl to the top with F_Ingredients, but now it seems like they only fill it half way
i like that you tell them what F_Ingredients and toppings you want instead of your typical F_FoodItem bar where you always wonder who touched or sneezed on the Food
they chop your F_FoodItem which is very nice
the A_Decor are good, but unless you like a ton of dressing make sure you tell them you only want a little because they put a lot on
they also have a punch card and punch it 2 times if you get a F_FI_Size F_FoodItem (only costs $1 more), or 1 time if you get a P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem
overall it's an ok place to get a F_FoodItem
unless you really have to have a F_Drinks with your F_FoodItem, i P_O_Experience/suggest you go to the F_FoodItem bar
it's not like the F_FoodItem here aren't good
they're ok, i suppose
the choices are limited and so are the 'F_Ingredients'
Service is ok but could be improved
my husband liked it a lot more than i did 'coz we came here twice but it's just a F_FoodItem to me
nothing out of the ordinary nor gourmet about it
i miss F_FoodItem bar!!

great Restaurant
the S_Menu is great and diverse, and is located very close to mcgill
i really P_O_Experience/enjoyed eating here; however it is very popular and is often crowded
on the plus side, you can make O_Reservation
the Food here was similar to what i have experienced at many other steakhouses
the Food is way P_F_FI_Price/overpriced and the F_FI_Quality is marginal
we went for the 45 dry aged porterhouse F_FoodItem and it arrived F_FI_CookingLevel very well but lacking in seasoning and all of the character you come to expect and O_Payment for in a dry aged F_FoodItem
the sides were very average as well
the one good thing was the Service
we had a big group and they handled everything well
definitely not the best choice in montreal
i went here for Food and will never P_O_Experience/go_back again
i thought the combinations on the S_Menu were kind of bizarre- having some F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem on the side- but maybe that's just me, too much carbs and F_Ingredients on one plate is kind of off-putting
the S_Menu had some choices that sounded good, but that's it
i ordered a 'make your own F_FoodItem', which had penne, mixed F_FoodItem, and rose F_Ingredients
when my Food arrived, it was not what i was expecting
way too much F_FoodItem, and not enough F_FoodItem- Restaurant were maybe 2 florets each of F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients, and maybe 3 pieces each of red and F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem didn't even seem F_FI_CookingLevel
the F_FoodItem was doused in F_Ingredients and was not very pleasant to eat
there was so much F_FoodItem, it could have been split between 2-3 people
i noticed all the Food going out looked like it could have fed that many people
why make that much Food for one person? i don't understand
takeout the rest after maybe, but i certainly didn't want to
the F_Dessert was just as bad- i ordered a mousse, which was much too rich, and again there was too much of it
despite the gross Food, i think the Service was good
the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly to me, addressing me in english as i was the only anglophone at the A_Fur_Table
i'd give the place 1
5 stars because of the Service
the Food is memorable, but for all the wrong reasons
nothing like F_FoodItem a metro
typical scottsdale in trying really hard to impress with a look and not being able to S_Delivery
big A_Plc_Bar in the middle seemed like the best place to sit
weird A_Fur_Table A_Fur_Table outlined the place with tacky A_Decor
the Food was ok but didn't seem to offer any real interesting or creative touches
calamari and F_FoodItem were decent but were a little P_F_FI_Price/pricey especially for Food
nothing really appealing to draw me back to this place
awesome Food
never had a P_O_Experience/disappointing S_Menu item
seitan F_FoodItem are as good or better than the real thing! great take-out spot
i'm under the impression that Food is a chain in las vegas, but you definitely get a completely different experience at each location
the husband ordered the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem combo, while i ordered the F_FoodItem lau lau  their two scoops of F_FoodItem and one scoop of mac F_FoodItem is an embarrassment to Food
when i opened my box, i thought they were kidding
what's up with the small F_FI_Size?  definitely P_O_Experience/disappointing on that part alone
the F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste okay, but my F_FoodItem was super P_F_FI_Quality/dry
there were minimal fatty pieces, and everyone knows a good lau lau should have some decent amount of fatty pieces! Service can be improved here
the only girl working was outside S_Stf_Behavior with some guys
i needed more S_Cutlery and since they are behind the counter, i had to go outside to request more
it seemed like i was bothering her
overall, there are way better Restaurant in vegas that do better in Food (F_FI_Quality and F_FI_Size) and Service
5 stars

we stopped in during the festival (make O_Reservation!)
the Food was very carefully prepared, and quite nice
i see one reviewer was concerned that this is a Restaurant establishment (that would be the A_Plc_Bar next door)
no, this has credible Food, and a reasonable S_Menu
a fun evening
does edinburgh really need three branches of i
mellis? if you've sampled the F_FoodItem they sell, you'll know the answer is yes
established in 1993, this A_OutsideView shop is the original i
and is A_LocatedArea halfway down the charming victoria street in the old town
it's tiny compared to delis like clark's and valvona & crolla but they manage to pack a lot of character and F_FI_Taste into the A_Places
on a weekend it's usually crammed with tourists ooohing and aaahing at the produce but in the week, its easy to walk in and pick up supplies for a last minute picnic
on those rare occasions, my basket usually includes a campagne F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients and some mrs kirkham lancashire
tried this after the reviews on yelp
had a bit of a W_Waiting on a saturday morning, but we expect that
they told us 10-15 minutes, but it actually was more like 25 minutes
while we were waiting we saw someone slip the S_Staff $20 to skip the line - not cool !  once seated (inside as we took first available) our S_Staff came over very quickly and took our F_Drinks order and then our full order - we got our Food very quickly considering how busy it was
the S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and gave us suggestions on the S_Menu since this was our first time Restaurant
i had the caprese omelet, which was excellent - my partner had the F_FoodItem pancakes and said they were good too
it was a little noisy inside, but the Food was excellent and we will P_O_Experience/be_back
one of my favorite Food cafés to visit! this morning our S_Staff S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive and P_S_Stf_Behavior/polite
she immediately noticed there was no F_Ingredients left on our A_Fur_Table and was quick to bring more for my F_Drinks,she also brought me a new F_Ingredients right away
it's not easy to find great Service in a busy place,but i am very pleased with everything here including the Food
the Food is a P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic choice! the F_Drinks is amazing & they bring you your own pot to pour from instead of having to wait and hope that you'll get a refill
next time you're hungry for a hearty Food,this is the spot!

amazing!  my husband and i have been "take out" from here for the past year
always so relish- and zero mistakes on our order
always order the pho soup- w F_FoodItem and an order of  spring F_FoodItem
we decided to stray this week and try recomended pho lein which had great reviews
such a P_O_Experience/disapointment
when we got home, unwrapped the F_FoodItem to put into the soup - it was already F_FI_CookingLevel? ugh
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/fatty and P_F_FI_Taste/tasteless
F_FoodItem- F_FI_Size, fresh F_FI_Taste, and P_F_FI_Taste/delish! be prepared w/ cash only and time to look for S_Parking

this was my first time eating Food and i wasn't P_O_Experience/disappointed at all
my husband ordered an F_Drinks and i quickly followed suit
when it arrived, i was pleasantly P_O_Experience/surprised by how good it was
i am used to very strong F_Drinks so when i go out, it's hard to find F_Drinks that i like but this one was simply amazing
i decided to try the pho with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and my husband ordered the pho with F_FoodItem and tripe
i loved the F_FoodItem leaves that they give you to add to your Food and thought the F_Appetizer was pretty good
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasty but the F_FoodItem weren't that great
if you decide to order the pho, i would P_O_Experience/recommend that you try it with something other than the F_FoodItem
my husband P_O_Experience/enjoyed his bowl of pho as well
we will definitely be P_O_Experience/going_back here sometime soon!

P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Food
beware can be quite spicy
P_F_FI_Quality/old fashioned F_FoodItem, F_Drinks, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, wonderful
give it a try and F_Drinks was only 2
50
it can be lonely being a Restaurant enthusiast in waterloo
for six years i've had to endure a city with a makeshift F_Drinks culture
to make matters worse, my coop terms take me to seattle and new york to enjoy the best Restaurant culture around only to yank me back to kw every 4 months
today i'm enjoying an F_Drinks on king street in uptown waterloo
any other day i would be at heuther's or my oh-so-favorite second cup
not today
on the corner of dupont & king Restaurant is a fresh infusion of F_Drinks culture into mundane uptown life
this new Restaurant is appropriately called F_Drinks culture and i have the best A_Furniture in the house! it's the A_Furniture A_Furniture in the corner by the A_Furniture
i can see the little old ladies in the street plastering their faces into the A_Furniture wondering what this new A_Places is
after walking away they are back literally 10 minutes later with their husbands to try it out
the lineup was short but the wait time was long
the S_Staff was new so i forgive him
i took in the S_Menu instead
oddly it's spread out the whole length of the A_Plc_Bar making it hard to read everything while standing in line
after ordering and taking my super awesome A_Fur_Table the S_Staff came by
she asked me exactly how much F_Drinks i'd like in my F_Drinks
it might not seem like special treatment but it is
the last time i had this custom a F_Drinks made for me it was at bauhaus in trendy hipster seattle
the W_Price are low W_Price to fair here
i have a feeling they will rise to match everyone
F_Drinks shops are always W_Price to run than initially thought as well
still, they are definitely competitive with starbucks, second cup, heuther hotel and even timmies
they have plenty of Food
if i had F_FI_Price to spare i'd try it out
though, the smell of it is enough to convince me to come back!the place is sparkling clean
sure to please my parents when they come for a visit
they never did like the grungy hipster makeshift house Restaurant's i generally drag them to
the A_Furniture are A_Furniture and the A_Furniture and A_Fur_Table real wood - not plasticy timmies style - though you knew that by now
they even have a nice big screen A_Ent_Tv so i can enjoy a A_Entertainment while getting some work done - free S_Wifi hurrah!oh look, even a cop walked in to try it out
this place is destined for greatness :p so long timmies and good riddance
one new Restaurant may not be enough to turn kw into a thriving cosmopolitan city overnight
but with a new Restaurant, i feel better that F_Drinks enthusiasts in kw aren't a dying species like first thought
how can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love Restaurant? i've been telling myself i'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that i keep losing
since this shop is in the same complex as a  gold's gym - that's a good enough excuse to indulge in sweet Service, right?the shop is so cute
black and white A_Decor and the A_Decor come from the beautiful F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and Food they have
i'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so i can get a F_FoodItem from here
they serve F_Drinks, F_Drinks and F_Drinks, F_Drinks, F_Drinks, F_Drinks
and F_Drinks (at night)
F_Drinks, F_Drinks and F_Drinks + F_Dessert? can i just live here? before i continue, i must say that my love for F_FoodItem started when i first had them in paris - oh l'amour! so, i'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever
the fad can die but i'd still love F_FoodItem
these F_Appetizer are my faves just like chunky F_FoodItem
i'd go to a macaron shop at every city i visit for comparison and get F_FoodItem in all their F_FI_Taste
so, i'm glad the vegas area has gimme some F_Ingredients
my true test for F_FoodItem is F_FoodItem but unfortunately, they didn't have it when i went but i think you can special order items a day before
they have 10 macaron F_FI_Taste at a time
i think 2 are seasonal F_FI_Taste and 8 mainstays
i've tried 10 F_FI_Taste: F_FI_Taste F_FoodItem, F_FI_Taste, F_FoodItem & F_Drinks, F_Ingredients, pb&j, grandpa's F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
i got 14 F_FoodItem - i had to get an extra fig and goat F_FoodItem macaron and 2 extra F_Ingredients
i also got a fresh F_Dessert and a green F_Drinks F_FoodItemcake
as for the macarons, here's how each ranks:5/5: fig & goat F_FoodItem, nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry4/5: snickerdoodle, pb&j, F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar, maple-F_Ingredients bar3/5: F_FoodItem & champagne, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cakegreen F_Drinks cheesecake:i love green F_Drinks and not a lot of places have green F_Drinks cheesecake
the crust is crunchy
the F_Dessert is deliciously creamy with a good F_Drinks flavor
it's topped with a F_FI_Size F_Ingredients and a F_FoodItem
amazing! 5/5P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_Dessert is a meringue topped with F_FoodItem
it's A_Decor and F_FI_CookingLevel
it's like a "healthier" F_Dessert if you will
5/5they warned me that the birthday cake was really sweet and that i shouldn't get it if i was torn between that and another flavor
hooray for honesty! the fig & goat F_FoodItem macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since i love goat F_FoodItem
sweet fig + tart goat F_FoodItem
yum! nutella is a no-brainer
it's instant love for me
the F_FoodItem & champagne sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the F_Ingredients were mild but really sweet
i think the F_FoodItem flavor needs to be more pronounced
i got lucky to have the last maple-F_Ingredients macaron
score! the Service is amazing here
very friendly and honest
i was holding up the line with all the F_Dessert i got and i felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items
but one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy
sure, the F_Dessert here cost an average of $7 apiece and the macarons are $3
50-4
50 each - the macarons are huuuuge though (the F_FI_Size of your palm or about 4 macarons) and the F_Ingredients are of F_FI_Quality
hello? i don't mind O_Payment for something good
you can actually get $1 off with a yelp check-in
and if you buy more than 6 macarons, you get 50cents off each additional you buy
i was smiling the whole time i was in the shop like a kid in candy store
my friend who was driving me around even said, "see! it's that smile that makes driving here Worthiness it"
so i had to eat here cause i was starving and visiting my mother in the hospital
i gotta admit what i had was not half bad for a fast Food joint
i had their F_FoodItem
it had some kick to it and the F_Ingredients was enjoyable
i've been coming here for years just because i live across the street
the Service here is horrible and the S_Staff are definitely high! i wish Restaurant was a A_LocatedArea closer cause i do like the Food
my rating is based only on Service
excellent hole in the A_Decor F_FoodItem
highly P_O_Experience/recommend
had the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and they were excellent
used to go to this subway all the time
but stopped going after i got extremely sick
they're S_Staff always gave off the vibe that they hate their job and this one S_Staff moves soo slow
expect to wait a half hour if he's making your F_FoodItem
and he also gave me a huge thick slice of turkey (it was the end) and i was just disgusted so i decided to stop going their
good A_Environment when you're up to on the deck
not sure about the inside as i didn't venture inside
good F_Drinks specials and an extensive S_Menu
had the F_FoodItem, and what led me to order based on the description lacked in F_FI_Taste
the "F_FoodItem" F_FoodItem is very bland
Restaurant are s many other good things on the S_Menu that i will be sure to return
i'll just pass on the F_FoodItem
at least it has A_Environment
the $13 F_Drinks was about an inch below the rim of my F_Drinks glass
i had to have that corrected immediately before the night started off wrong
the whole Food could be ruined but that F_Drinks will not be
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were orgasmic
not happy that they charge $5 for a ramekin of F_Ingredients
had a gift card that could take care of the whole Food and the idiot couldn't process it
he made it sound like it was my problem
it was issued by your Restaurant, not sure why it was my issue
he actually asked it i wanted to use the S_Gift or O_Payment by other means
i just about lost it
i still have nightmares about the stupidity of that statement since S_Gift are just as good as W_Price
if you work in the industry you'll get 25% off on mondays after 9 p
to begin, i am not the biggest fan of Food to begin with, but this place was great
we went with another couple and seemed to order everything on the S_Menu
i don't like F_FoodItem, but they got a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem that was great, the F_Ingredients was excellent too
i would make a O_Reservation if going for Food as it was super packed and the A_Environment is relatively P_A_Env_Size/small
its okay, i was not really sold on the whole idea that their F_FoodItem is similar to that of the F_FI_Quality of F_FoodItem from back east
and i also don't know why they insist on giving F_Ingredients with every order
after giving it another chance, my wife and i went back
instead of S_Del_Time 2 hours for a A_Fur_Table, we selectively chose to wait for a A_Plc_Bar A_Fur_Table
after 20 minutes we got one and this time the Food was great, not just good
nice place with good S_Staff
Food is good and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
if you enjoy crab, this is the place to go
we had F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and of course some really good F_FoodItem
i P_O_Experience/enjoyed everything about it
i'll P_O_Experience/be_back
if you like F_Ingredients
you'll like seasons 52
after my wife and i dined on the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, we were convinced that in order to add F_Ingredients to their reduced calories, they poor on the F_Ingredients
i read a few reviews here that mentioned bland F_FI_Taste
possibly the management read the same reviews and asked their A_Plc_Kitchen S_Staff to open the S_Cutlery?   it really spoiled what could have been a nice O_Experience
and skip the F_FoodItem
very over W_Price for what amounts to a plate of mixed greens and little else
imo, true Food does a much better job
on the pro side, the Restaurant is very nicely designed with a pleasant A_Environment and good A_Decor
and the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Availability/attentive and P_S_Stf_Behavior/polite
first time for me at diverti A_Plc_Bar & grill
clearly a great location being on the corner of university & mill
S_Parking is in the back next to jack in the box
pretty average A_Decor inside
very typical of what you would find of a campus A_Plc_Bar
carpets been removed and they stained the exposed cement floor
7+ A_Ent_Tv above the A_Plc_Bar so good for catching a A_Entertainment event
we ordered hot F_FoodItem to start and they were good
a few P_F_FI_Size/undersized F_FoodItem made it onto the plate, but no complaints
Food: F_FI_Size F_FoodItem w/ F_Ingredients and cream F_FoodItem + jalapeno
it's a specialty F_FoodItem of theirs and it wasn't bad
different, but good
W_Price were extremely reasonable and they had a deep S_Menu of items to choose from
Service was good
granted Restaurant were only about 10 people in the Restaurant, but S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and made some recommendations
full A_Plc_Bar and lots of brews on tap
i'll be back to check out Offers!

excellent place to get a S_Cutlery of F_Drinks, chat with a friend, or work
i work downtown and this place is awesome!  i've ordered both F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem - both P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic
they do all of their own fresh grinding and seasoning of F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
the A_Fur_Table area is really tight and cramped but they just opened an upstairs too
the Food time crowd is crazy busy, but overall excellent!  if you work downtown, definitely try it out (order take out)
the Food was surprisingly P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh tasting and the Service was impeccable
the W_Price were a little high for what you get but all in all a great experience we will P_O_Experience/be_back for sure
we go here about once a week for Offers
the S_Staff is very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Experience/efficient
they take the time to get to know the customers and know when to look for a refill
good, not great, selection of tap F_Drinks - all good and interesting but not extensive
the A_Plc_Bar Food is excellent - predominately gastro-pub
the F_FoodItem is great and the F_FoodItem is one of the best in town
we also enjoy the F_FoodItem dip
we were torn between F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients (based on yelp reviews)
very pleased with our choice to go to F_Ingredients pancakes & Restaurant'! everything looked so good that we ended up ordering 3 Food
the salmon/cream Food, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem cheesecake F_FoodItem (amazing!!!)
Food was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and well W_Price
also really P_O_Experience/enjoyed the A_OutsideView A_Fur_Table!

outstanding Service, very clean
ordered the F_Appetizer and the F_FoodItem (F_FoodItem on french with au jous)Food were P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot
will be going back :)

great Restaurant for Food bunch to get a good F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem are not bad either
Food was F_Ingredients well
we had good Service and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive S_Staff
Food could have been warmer
we were in vegas a few days ago and wanted to try out gordon ramsay F_FoodItem so we called O_Reservation and found out they were booked until after 10pm
no problem as she told us we could go to the A_Plc_Bar if we wanted to as it has a full S_Menu Restaurant
we ended up going to Food at F_FoodItem and decided to have a F_Drinks and F_Dessert at ramsay
when we got to the host stand we were told that the A_Plc_Bar was bought out for the night by a party
this would have been great information to give us when we called earlier that day don't you think?! we were pissed but not as pissed as if we had decided to come here for Food
we got over it and went to max brenner for F_Dessert which was great
i don't know if this was the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing but it left a really bad F_FI_Taste in our mouths
maybe we'll try it the next time we go
but Restaurant are so many other Food choices in vegas
i'm a F_FoodItem snob
and i P_O_Experience/enjoyed this place
Service was excellent!  our S_Staff, S_Staff, was P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledgable with a great sense of humor
Food was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_Size/big F_FoodItem
they didn't skimp on the F_FoodItem in our F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem edamame was very strong so make sure your date eats it too
we ordered the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_Appetizer, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
love the P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem to top!  everything was eaten with no complaints at all!

Service was a bit slow but the Food way more then made up for it
Food was okay
i'm sure i'll P_O_Experience/be_back for football season
i work downtown; been here two or three S_Del_Time for Food
F_FoodItem F_FoodItem - their's is good
good F_FI_Taste, several F_Ingredients available, and the A_Places (at least on the plate) are fine (not heaping, but fine)
i've had the F_FoodItem
okay, so simply based upon my experience and input from friends, F_FoodItem is usually P_F_FI_Size/thick and not soupy
the F_Ingredients is soupy here - i
it has a lot of F_Appetizer
but, get this now
i've ordered it twice because it's good
so it may not look like what you're expecting when you get it, but give it a try
F_FoodItem were good
there seems to be a lot of F_Ingredients, but then, not everybody  makes the effort to pull some out
good F_Ingredients!all in all, this is a convenient spot for good F_FoodItem in the center of downtown charlotte
fortunately for us here in the queen city, we now have two options available!!if you do go, get the F_FoodItem F_Appetizer
they are good!one thing to note
if you order a F_Drinks, you're buying a bottle
that's it
so your refills are limited to your bottle
want more? buy another
i don't care for this approach
the S_Staff was very nice, P_S_Staff/friendly and P_S_Stf_Experience/informative
not terribly S_Stf_Availability, but then they don't have to do refills either
;-)so, i like this place and will most likely P_O_Experience/be_back
during the course of  exploring the strip district of the city i was looking forward to having a pub-style Food somewhere in the area
unfortunately, the place i was hoping to visit was S_OpenHours on S_OpenHours (should have checked the listing on yelp!)
i walked into kelly o's (which must be 180 degrees from a pub setting) to find a bustling Food filled with guests of all ages and descriptions
my S_Staff, andrea, approached the A_Fur_Table with 45 seconds and took my order
while tempted to have something from the sunday extended Food S_Menu, i opted for a cup of F_FoodItem pot pie soup and "classic" patty melt
the tasty F_Appetizer arrived quickly and hot (and i mean hot!) and included a nice piece of crust and chunk of F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was also good (hot), rye F_FoodItem perfectly F_FI_CookingLevel, good F_FoodItem melt and F_FoodItem F_FI_CookingLevel to the temperature
in spite of the business levels and somewhat cramped quarters there was no level of chaos at kello o's
instead, S_Staff moved about smoothly while S_Delivery orders and every departing guest was warmly thanked for their visit
the F_Drinks mix ranged from children to folks well into their 80's
and, there was an obvious mix of F_FI_Size" and first timers like me
andrea was conversational, refilled my beverage without request and provided me with much appreciated information about the district
by the way, the place,including A_Plc_RestRoom, was remarkably clean which is saying plenty when considering the number of people that obviously went through the place
it's nice to visit a place that doesn't try to be "something they're not
" the S_Menu is straightforward and genuine, the Food is "as promised," the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and connected with their customers
i'll likely visit again with friends and family
tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back
not bad, but for their high W_Price and the F_FI_Quality, there are better choices in lv
noise level is high
what i learned from my bacchanal Food experience                                                              by lori r    1)  if you want the super bacchanal experience you must go after 3pm!  a lot of what i've heard described in reviews was not on the Food that we went to on a tuesday at S_OpenHours
that being said, we also O_Payment half of what others O_Payment at night
we arrived around 10:45 a
, so it was around $50 for both of us (before tip)
2)  tip!  add gratuity to that bill when you O_Payment it at the register
they will mark your receipt as a O_Payment
don't know if that gives you extra credit or what, but they sure make note of it
and if that's not reason enough, these S_Staff work hard keeping your F_Drinks refilled and whisking away endless empty S_Cutlery
they also take F_Ingredients and S_Cutlery very seriously, as i heard a serious conversation that involved keeping track of whose were whose
(you have to ask for it, if you want them, by the way, they aren't on the A_Fur_Table)
3) pace yourself
they were changing over from Food to Food when we arrived, so they kept putting out new things
favorites for me were some asian items
the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem
also thought the sliders were excellent F_FI_Quality, F_FoodItem very good
there was an awesome F_Ingredients potato gratin, a tasty tater tot casserole
a very P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful F_FoodItem (although Restaurant was nothing habanero hot about it)
from the italian section, not a lot was calling out to me, but i did have a F_FoodItem which was good, although very big
a smaller one would have been even better
Food was P_O_Experience/disappointing to me, as expectations were high based on the reviews i had read, but those were obviously for dinner
i asked if it was too early for crab legs, and was told yes, not until after 3
steamed F_FoodItem were good though
4) F_Dessert selection must be different this early in the day, also
very good though, but sadly, no macaroons!  i tried a F_Dessert and a Food
both were pretty good
so, to sum up my personal bacchanal experience, it was quite good, but being S_OpenHours Food eaters,  we have preferred our Food-time experiences at both  wynn and wicked spoon
i was super excited to find a soul Food place here in las vegas, just moving here from atlanta, and being a huge soul Food fan! i did my research on yelp and decided to give soul Food Restaurant a try! we were P_S_Stf_Behavior/greeted by a very nice S_Staff and A_Fur_Table right away on a sunday, so far so good! i ordered the F_FoodItem Food, comes with two sides and cornbread (F_FoodItem is sooo P_F_FI_Taste/yummy, prob the best part of the Food) i really wanted collard greens, my fav, but they were out so i ordered F_FoodItem and yams
my husband ordered P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and gravy and F_FoodItem
we tried to order the ribs for our daughter off the kids S_Menu, but they were out of ribs too :( so we ordered P_F_FI_CookingLevel/baked F_FoodItem for her
after a pretty long wait we were told very apologetically that they were out of F_FoodItem also
at this point i did want to leave, or wish i would have known about them being out of Food so early on a sunday, i would have liked the option to try again another day
but after waiting about 1
5 hrs we stayed, and S_Staff said that she would comp two sides for us
we finally got our Food, honestly the Food size was quite laughable (maybe ive been spoiled down south?) on the plus, the Food was pretty P_F_FI_Taste/tasty but for the W_Price/Food ratio and the wait i dont know  if i'll be P_O_Experience/going_back? btw
we ordered the F_Ingredients momma : sweet F_Drinks/ F_Drinks and the F_Ingredients daddy : kool aid and F_Drinks
really good, but very sweetF_Drinks all my F_Ingredients for the month ;) lol

a bowl of potentialon blistering cold nights, sometimes all it takes is a hot bowl of soup to purge the chills & rejuvenate the senses
on a quiet little part of what appears to be dead-man's alley, sits this cozy little shoppe; a star of hope in the sea of darkness
upon entry a fog of authenticity & warmth envelopes you, as the hosts so graciously greet, get you situated & promptly serve you
observant, keen & interested; a cohesive team that works together as they shuffle around caring for F_FI_CookingLevel, juicy, flavorful, the karaage hits every corner of your palate in a vibrant explosion of F_Ingredients & feelings, as it slowly melts in your mouth
generously portioned & accompanied with a side F_FoodItem
should there ever be shortage of alcohol in the world, the F_FoodItem broth would most definitely be my new vice
it oozes of authenticity, with an array of tantalizing F_FI_Taste; from the succulent F_FoodItem, to the wafer F_FI_Size seaweed the fukumimi ramen is a testament to the establishment's commitment to excellence
praises aside, Restaurant are definitely two major issues that almost made me drop a star
please do lay off the salt
i almost felt my tongue fall off after my 4th karaage
also please cut back on the seaweed in the fukumimi ramen, that almost ruined the experience as i was winding down dinner (it F_FI_Taste like seaweed soup instead of ramen)
overall, i applaud the Service, i shall plan a return in the near future
very good F_FoodItem
have been here several times and Food always pretty good
love the  F_Appetizer with sriracha ranch
sometimes Service slow but not a bad place for F_FoodItem and F_Drinks
the Food is fabulous (i love the gecko burro and pollo fundido
and the F_FoodItem and cream--one word-- amazing), the Service and location are awesome and their involvement in the community is so great! i love supporting a great business like this!

came here for brunch/Food this sunday; i wasn't overly hungry, but luckily everything was made a la carte, and W_Price fairly! i shared the Food with my friend (it came with 6 and a pile of shredded beets), the F_Ingredients was sweet and savory with leafy F_Appetizer of F_FoodItem
i often find anything with F_FoodItem to be too P_F_FI_Healthy/salty, but it was just right, especially with the sweet F_Ingredients pairing
they have the healthy option to get F_Ingredients wraps instead of F_Ingredients or F_Ingredients, and seeing as there was an abundant amount of free F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, i didn't miss having a tortilla-the F_Ingredients was perfect! the free F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem also came with three P_F_FI_Size/smaller and unique F_FI_Taste F_FoodItem/F_Ingredients that varied in F_Ingredients and spiciness-it was awesome to have variety
to top of the great Food and Service, the A_Environment was amazing
i loved the A_Decor and A_Decor, a A_Decor and beautiful well kept A_Plc_Bathroom
i will definitely P_O_Experience/be_back!

cute Restaurant in an odd A_LocatedArea
very accommodating even though it was the last day for my groupon
very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Availability/attentive S_Staff-especially the nice young man filling the F_Drinks!  i agree their F_Drinks were not the highlight but they have other, name brand choices at reasonable W_Price
Food was very good
Food looked odd because F_FoodItem didn't appear to be F_FI_CookingLevel but the varieties were good-very P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and generous F_FoodItem
had the F_FoodItem Offers
you could tell that was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem and due to the richness, i thought the S_Staff F_FI_Size was just right
ate every bite
good find from groupon!

really good F_Drinks, and the F_FoodItem are outstanding
prime rib sliders were really good but could've used a little more jus for dipping
best for last:  the cheddar ale soup is totally bonkers!  i've never had anything like it
Service was attentive, helpful with the S_Menu and F_Drinks selection, and pretty quick
the place has a sports-A_Plc_Bar A_Environment with a zillion A_Ent_Tv's and a rambunctious crowd, but nothing i'd be afraid to bring the children to
excellent F_FoodItem
great W_Price
excellent Service
nice A_Decor
i highly P_O_Experience/recommend humari F_FoodItem if you are downtown! they literally pulled me in off the street and i have been P_O_Experience/going_back ever since!

Food options in every Food category! awesome Offers Offers- (3-6 am and pm) where else can you get a F_Drinks for $3!!?!? Offers during every nfl A_Entertainment! phenomenal S_Staff- super nice and P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly! open 24 hours! and Food served 24/7! my new favorite hangout! great gaming incentives!  you must go!!!

dickey's saved my thanksgiving!my brother & i decided to do thanksgiving w/ friends super last minute
hash house a go go ran out of F_FoodItem
wtf
so did mimi's Restaurant, lucilles, and famous daves
double wtf
i needed thanksgiving to-go and only 2 days to do it! dickey's had 2 F_FoodItem options for $49
99--cajun P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem or smoked F_FoodItem
of course, they were sold out of the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem but they had 1 smoked F_FoodItem left
i called dibs!!!the pick-up process was easy
zipped in and out within 5 minutes
they're S_OpenHours on thanksgiving so pick-up needs to be the day before
they're open late so i picked up around 7pm
the F_FoodItem is wrapped in S_Delivery and comes in an oven-safe aluminum pan ready-to-heat
it takes about 2 hours for the F_FoodItem to reach eating temperature
excellent S_Delivery since my friend just moved to vegas and has minimal bake/cookware available
i needed low maintenance Food and dickey's definitely made the holidays a bit easier for me
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was pretty P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
i was a little concerned that the F_FoodItem wouldn't have the thanksgiving F_Ingredients i was looking for but F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
not the best i've ever had but very good
as much as i love cooking and being able to put all the F_Ingredients i want into things
it was a relief to not have to deal with cooking a large bird and focus on the epic A_Entertainment of settlers of catan and wii tennis
just stopped in for my first firehouse sub and i wasn't P_O_Experience/disappointed
i had the F_FI_Size pastrami F_FoodItem on white F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, a little P_F_FI_Taste/crispy, and very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
the pastrami itself was cut thick and also had a great F_Ingredients
they have a hot F_Ingredients bar loaded with great, hard-to-find, hot F_Ingredients
the only complaint i have is that it does take a little while to get your F_FoodItem, about 10-15 min
now this certainly didn't ruin the experience for me and to be fair, they were getting slammed with orders
overall, it is very easy to P_O_Experience/recommend this sub shop
i'll certainly be P_O_Experience/coming_back
next time for a F_FoodItem & F_FoodItem!

i don't usually write reviews but today i decided this place was worth one :)    i just got the 12 piece F_FoodItem Food for the family and i have to say, it was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious!F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/crispy, not greasy at all, coleslaw was awesome
kids loved the F_Ingredients and F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients ( i don't eat them ) but they said it was great
also got an order of he F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
definitely worth P_O_Experience/going_back for!

Food is great! to be honest i first thought it had a fast Food concept and was a little sketchy but it's not at all
not sure what i ordered, all i know is that it was one of there specials and it had F_FoodItem in it
great new place
definitely P_O_Experience/coming_back!

Food is ok, had the Food, need a little more F_Ingredients
excelnte Restaurant right across from A_LocatedArea if you did not get tickets to the opera from here you can listen, magnificent A_Environment, Service is also very good, F_FI_Quality excellent reasonably F_FI_Price Food, on 2 occasions i have been always see more locals tourists and this always speaks highly of the Restaurant, also is seen to be people of very good standard
Restaurant F_FoodItem pie is the best i've had in pa and the F_FoodItem is great, sensational F_Dessert
i came Restaurant superbowl sunday last year, and actually saw one of my middle-aged professors getting cozy with her hubby (awwwkwarrrrd)
but i guess that just goes to show the people that frequent esquire
in general, the crowd is older, and everyone seem to be regulars
the S_Staff seem to know S_Staff Restaurant by name
it reminds me a lot of that A_Ent_Tv A_Entertainment cheers
free F_FoodItem (learning to just drop the shells on the A_Places was the hardest part for me
it just feels so unnatural!), P_F_FI_Price/cheap Food and F_Drinks, lots of A_Ent_Tv's A_Environment, and lots of A_Fur_Table and/or A_Fur_Table at the A_Plc_Bar
i wouldn't necessary come Restaurant if you're looking to get all A_Decor to impress on a weekend night, as you'll just be getting those "uhh, move along F_Ingredients" stares from the other F_Drinks all night, but definitely a good Restaurant to grab a F_Appetizer to eat, enjoy the A_Entertainment, catch up with a friend, etc
lots of A_OutsideView A_Fur_Table too
great atmosphere and comfy A_OutsideView A_Plc_Patio A_Fur_Table
the F_FoodItem options were so delicious
the F_Drinks list provides a large selection of F_Drinks
the S_Del_Time to be A_Fur_Table was a bit long but W_Waiting it
i will be back
we recently moved to A_LocatedArea, az and i was looking for a Restaurant with a great A_OutsideView and a great S_Menu for my wife's birthday
i found several recommendations for 'different pointe of A_OutsideView'
we arrived around 6pm and were A_Fur_Table inside at a A_Fur_Table that was front center looking out over the A_OutsideView
beautiful A_OutsideView!!! the Restaurant was clean and very P_A_Env_Type/quiet
during our visit only 3 other parties Restaurant
if you want a P_A_Env_Type/quiet A_Environment, you will find it Restaurant
i found it odd that Restaurant wasn't A_OutsideView A_Ent_Music
we S_Delivery the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and a F_FoodItem & baby wild arugula F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and very P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
we followed with our hibernate courses, cold F_Drinks diver F_FoodItem and wild california F_FoodItem
our S_Staff attempted to have the S_Staff select a F_Drinks for us but S_Staff was no where to be found
the maitre d' finally came over to assist
he made selection that Restaurant didn't have
i selected a F_Drinks and it was very good
Restaurant have an impressive F_Drinks list and A_Places
our F_FoodItem courses arrived and i knew right away that my wife was not happy with her F_FoodItem
my F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
we tried each others and i found the F_FoodItem very over Offers, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/burnt on the exterior and cold in the center
they were to the point of almost being inedible
our S_Staff did not return to see how the Food turned out so i switched Food with my wife
it was her birthday and i avoided raising a disturbance when our S_Staff finally returned, after we had finished our Food
i ate the worst $32 F_FoodItem course of my life
after a very P_O_Experience/disappointing F_FoodItem course we avoided F_Dessert
F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Size/undersized and P_F_FI_Price/expensive for the F_FI_Quality
we will not be returning for Food
we might for a F_Drinks on the A_Plc_Patio
'dissapointing pointe of A_OutsideView'
would be a 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus if they brought siad back
when he ran it, it was clean, fast and the S_Staff looked like they could work anywhere
not so much anymore
i think this Ambience was a house before they turned it into a Restaurant because the halls are a bit narrow and the A_Places are a bit P_A_Env_Size/small, but the Food is great! they give you F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem while you are S_Del_Time for your Food and their F_FoodItem is home made and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! Restaurant F_Drinks are amazing and huge (if you get the large) and pretty strong ;)
i wouldn't P_O_Experience/suggest you don't go on a friday night for Food because they do get pretty busy and the S_Del_Time gets pretty long
for a long time i have not gone to Restaurant and on this night i felt i needed it
i also had to try the double down F_FoodItem
i was P_S_Stf_Behavior/greeted with a very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff with prompt fast Service
i S_Delivery the double down with an S_Delivery of F_Ingredients, mash F_Ingredients with F_FoodItem and one F_Ingredients
i O_Exp_StarsByCus the Food as followed
double down F_FoodItem - dcoleslaw - b+mash F_Ingredients with F_FoodItem - F_Ingredients - bi have always P_O_Experience/enjoyed some Restaurant every once in awhile
i was glad i had made this stop i forgot how much i like the F_Ingredients and mash potatoes with F_FoodItem great stuff
i will P_O_Experience/be_back again someday for sure
Food is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, but agree with other reviewers
you don't get much for what you O_Payment
way too P_F_FI_Price/pricey!
wow i forgot how great F_FoodItem bell is
i never realized F_FoodItem had so many zero F_Ingredients options on their S_Menu
you might say what F_FoodItem bell has zero F_Ingredients options you are crazy
to which i say no sir just about everything on their S_Menu is zero calories because once you throw it up after you eat it you don't absorb any calories
i am sorry i don't usually rank on a place this bad but this was really bad
i am sure some people just love it but not this person
the S_Staff seemed nice enough
although it seemed like the S_Staff on the registers second day on the job
also when you just stuff the S_Cutlery still inside the wrapper in the Restaurant where the S_Cutlery go and tear open the end that is not really refilling the S_Cutlery
just saying
the Food is P_F_FI_Taste/tasteless and horrible
i wouldn't even feed it to my F_FoodItem because the aspca might come after me
i know that is harsh and i am being mean to get a laugh but this is the worst kind of fast Food
it gives fast Food a bad name
i don't even dare call it Restaurant Food because it is so far away from real mexican Food it has never even met real mexican Food
real mexican Food would beat up F_FoodItem bell Food if they crossed paths
like i said i know people just love F_FoodItem bell but as for me i will try, shouldn't be that hard, to never eat Restaurant again
sorry F_FoodItem bell
it's not often i'm off on a friday afternoon to enjoy F_Ingredients's Food S_Menu
this was our first time at this A_LocatedArea, normally we Restaurant at the A_LocatedArea on A_LocatedArea
i started off with a bowl of Restaurant southwestern F_FoodItem F_Appetizer and it was awesome
just the right amount of P_F_FI_Taste/spiciness combined with a hearty A_Places of F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
my bf started out with a side F_FoodItem, it a little on the small side but all the F_Ingredients were fresh
i S_Delivery a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem on a pretzel F_FoodItem and requested F_FoodItem F_Ingredients on the side instead of F_FoodItem, the F_FoodItem F_Ingredients didn't come so i asked again when they brought the Food
wouldn't ya know i finished my whole F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and never got the F_Ingredients (our S_Staff didn't check on us after bringing the Food until it was time to clear the S_Cutlery)
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasty but a little on the dry side
the F_FoodItem were piping hot and always well Offers
james S_Delivery a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem which also came with F_FoodItem
his F_FoodItem was much P_F_FI_Quality/harder than it should have been for just a P_F_FI_CookingLevel/toasted F_FoodItem which was a P_O_Experience/disappointment
he also never received a refill on his F_Drinks
if we had gotten the F_FoodItem F_Ingredients, the refill of F_Drinks and his F_FoodItem not rock hard, i would have given 4 O_Exp_StarsByCus for a wonderful Food
but, since the ball was dropped on too many occasions, i can't
i will be back to F_Ingredients's, just not this A_LocatedArea
Food was great
excellent customer Service
we went during world S_Cutlery finals,  great A_Environment
Food was Service quickly,  decent F_FI_Price,  casual A_Environment
we will P_O_Experience/go_back next time in A_LocatedArea
good F_FoodItem and chargrilled F_FoodItem
brings back memories from my childhood getting Food with my dad
and the F_FI_Price are just right
i will be P_O_Experience/coming_back Restaurant often
i had a F_Ingredients F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/boiled and perfect
i then had a bacon F_FoodItem
chargrilled F_FI_Taste so good
also had F_FoodItem on the side
and the fries were
fries, nothing Offers
Food F_FoodItem is excellent
only been Restaurant for brunch but the A_Environment, S_Menu, and Food F_FoodItem selection is great
P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff as well
so my fiancé and i heard a lot of good things about this A_Places, so we decided to give it a try
we placed an S_Delivery for pick up, and when we got Restaurant, the S_Staff behind the counter had S_Staff head phones in and was pretty P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude, like S_Staff didn't want to be bothered
so we got our Food, we both S_Delivery the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem were not good at all
the F_FoodItem was sliced, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled, and F_FI_Taste like F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/microwaved
the best part of the F_FoodItem was the F_FoodItem
all in all, we were really P_O_Experience/disappointed and will not return
big let down!
the F_FoodItem was great and the the pick up Service was polite
i look forward to going back Restaurant many times in the future
forget the P_F_FI_Price/pricey F_FoodItem at the big name Restaurant
come to yama F_FoodItem for the best Food deal in town
it's only $21 for Food and $23 for Food for ayce F_FoodItem
unlike most ayce F_FoodItem joints, yama offers uni, F_FoodItema, sweet F_FoodItem, etc
(limit 1 S_Cutlery per person for most)
Restaurant's almost never a S_Del_Time, and the F_FoodItem F_FI_Quality is decent for what you're O_Payment
Restaurant's several Food that i always get
the uni is a coin flip, but i've had pretty good tastings recently
i like the sweet F_FoodItem, but i'm not a fan of the fried S_Menu that accompanies it
the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Size/huge and is sure to fill you up
my favorite F_FoodItem to S_Delivery is the wet dream, which comes as a P_F_FI_CookingLevel/baked cali F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem, cream F_FoodItem, and finished with sweet yam F_Ingredients
i always end with an S_Delivery of white F_FoodItem nigiri (A_Entertainment goodness)
if you don't like F_FoodItem, start with the F_FoodItem, which is a poor man's chirashi bowl
skip the soft shell F_FoodItem, which is too P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried for my liking
lastly, save room for F_Dessert as you can S_Delivery ice cream F_FoodItem and two scoops of F_Dessert
the mango F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic and i'm a big fan of the F_Drinks and F_Ingredients F_FoodItem
great Food, very very slow Service (took an S_Del_Time to get Food) and a poor F_Drinks list
unless you really know your italian F_Drinks very poor selection for the california grape lovers
das boot!!! the F_Drinks is the staple that keeps me P_O_Experience/coming_back to the Restaurant, especially with their selection of authentic A_LocatedArea F_Drinks
outstanding F_Drinks and plenty of it, huge F_Ingredients for little money
the huge boot is only $15 on thursday night, so happy S_Del_Time Restaurant usually turns into happy late night!!the Food isn't bad, sits heavy if you're not ready of used to it though
the F_FoodItem fry on friday is pretty good too, all you can eat F_FoodItem for $10 isn't bad!!
went Restaurant for Food
the S_Del_Time wasn't that bad
it only took us ten S_Del_Time to get a A_Fur_Table A_OutsideView
the A_Environment was great especially when the A_LocatedArea A_Decor is right across the street
Food was decent, but it was reaaaaalllllyyyyyy slow
for all of the great places to eat in the A_LocatedArea, i'd skip pink F_FoodItem unless i were staying at the hard rock and needed something fast
it's pretty standard Restaurant, but i think Restaurant dropped the ball in a few key areas
first off was the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem were a+, some of the best Restaurant F_FoodItem i've ever had
but the F_FoodItem
d-
they gave us 3 different kinds: F_FoodItem-based, dark green, A_Decor green
each one F_FI_Taste pretty much the same and had zero F_Ingredients to them
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem which came with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and also tried the Food
the F_FoodItem were basically F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients on a F_FoodItem
all F_Ingredients were good, but how about a little F_FoodItem and seasoning to the F_FoodItem!  the F_FoodItem skewers had a little F_Ingredients to them (finally!)
the Service was quick and everything came out correctly, but the S_Staff was clearly not in a mood to be P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly with a group of 16 guys who tip well
S_Staff loss i suppose
we were in A_LocatedArea for a mid-week business event and stayed at the venetian
we made advanced O_Reservation before arriving in lv through open A_Fur_Table
com
everything went smoothly and the S_Staff called each time (we ate two F_FoodItem Restaurant) to confirm O_Reservation the day of the Food
both Food were pretty much flawless
we each seemed to especially enjoy any of the nightly Offers which happened to be hanger F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_Ingredients F_FoodItem and some other goodies
fantastic café A_LocatedArea in A_LocatedArea
i went Restaurant thanks to the yelp app because i was looking for a Restaurant to get a F_Drinks and i was staying in this A_LocatedArea of the strip
canyon F_Ingredients is great because you can create your own F_Drinks, and Restaurant use real F_FoodItem
this is not F_Drinks or F_Dessert or what have you
the 20 ounce is $9, which is definitely higher than your local F_Drinks, but considering the A_LocatedArea (one of the nicest Restaurant on the strip) plus the fact that Restaurant use real F_FoodItem (when no one else near Restaurant does) i think the F_FI_Price is totally fine
i have pretty specific instructions regarding my F_Drinks, i like to have F_Drinks how i make F_Drinks at home
canyon F_Ingredients did a great job
all three days i had a S_Staff named S_Staff make my F_Drinks, and it was fantastic and consistent
can't P_O_Experience/recommend this place enough if you are in need of a F_Drinks
the Food F_FoodItem was the only Food item i tried, and it's the reason i am giving canyon F_Ingredients 4 O_Exp_StarsByCus instead of 5
it has a lot of F_Ingredients, which may be why it didn't resonate with me
too much going on perhaps
Restaurant was something in Restaurant that i couldn't put my finger on for which i didn't care
i didn't even eat half of it
so, i would not get this again, but i know where to get my daily F_Drinks next S_Del_Time i am in A_LocatedArea
best Food in vegas
go on the weekend for the gourmet Food with kobe F_FoodItem and rack of F_Ingredients
kobe was tougher than the prime F_FoodItem, but the A_LocatedArea was great
F_FoodItem legs and F_FoodItem were ok
P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked, and A_Env_Size F_FI_Taste
awesome F_Dessert
this Restaurant is an excellent example of A_LocatedArea fine dining at its best
some excellent highlights; the F_FoodItem are fantastically made, the seafood trio F_Appetizer is a must when dining Restaurant, and the Service should be, and was, perfect
we truly P_O_Experience/enjoyed our O_Experience Restaurant, and although Restaurant are many fine dining Restaurant in A_LocatedArea to choose from, Restaurant are few that tend to get all those key elements and Service standards working together harmoniously perfect such as aquaknox
the only reason i give this place four O_Exp_StarsByCus instead of five is because the Service was lacking a bit
it took forever for us to get F_Drinks/extra S_Cutlery/F_Ingredients
other than that, the Food was outstanding
we came Restaurant on memorial day because we were too lazy to do our own grilling, and after smelling our neighbors cooking some F_FoodItem, we just had to have them!we got the fire P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem for the A_Fur_Table
my only complaint is that the F_FoodItem was not very meaty and if i'm O_Payment $10 for an F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem shouldn't be P_F_FI_Size/small with F_Ingredients that hardly have Food to grab at
the F_FoodItem/mayo dipping F_Ingredients was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! my gf and i shared the lucille's platter - it came w/ two F_FoodItem breasts, four F_FoodItem, a few slices of tri-tip F_FoodItem and two sides
we opted for F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
every single F_Appetizer of this Food was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was fall-off-the-bone tender and the F_FoodItem was impressive too (usually F_FoodItem is just blah for me)
the tri-tip was absolutely phenomenal
we ate the entire platter and brought one P_F_FI_Size/huge F_FoodItem breast home, so these S_Staff F_FI_Size do not mess around! the F_Ingredients was also really really good
it was obvious that F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled and Restaurant was some type of F_FoodItem F_Ingredients on it F_FoodItem was extremely P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
all in all, i will definitely P_O_Experience/be_back the next time i'm craving some southern F_FoodItem
be weary, the F_FI_Price are a little high compared to other F_FoodItem joints around S_Del_Time, but i do think the F_FI_Quality of Food and the preparation is Worthiness it!
i love the Food concept, their F_FoodItem and have had great Food almost every time i've been Restaurant
the only drawback is their S_Delivery system
if you don't come often, it's hard to remember all the abbreviations and details needed for their S_Delivery form
their S_Staff hasn't always been P_S_Stf_Behavior/eager to make the S_Delivery process easier either
Worthiness figuring out Restaurant system for the Food though!
i love this A_LocatedArea Food, which features everything from F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem to F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
you have to get the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem as an F_Appetizer ($1
95)
the F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Size/thick and P_F_FI_Taste/crispy, and the F_FoodItem had a nice F_Appetizer to F_FoodItem
they went great with my strong but sweet F_Ingredients F_Drinks ($6
95), which was the perfect complement to the heat-filled Food
i had two F_FoodItem F_FoodItem ($9
95) smothered in the vegetarian red F_Ingredients, which came with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem-i got black F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Size/large, and the Food was great-the F_FI_Taste were bold, and everything F_FI_Taste fresh
besides the P_F_FI_Taste/yummy Food, i also appreciated Restaurant for its Ambience
it had a dark and romantic vibe, with P_F_FI_CookingLevel/burnt F_FoodItem A_Decor that gave it a warm and cozy A_Environment
Restaurant is owned by tom jetland, who also owns Restaurant Restaurant fez and switch
i'd have to say switch is my favorite of the three, but you can't really go wrong with any of them
Restaurant is good, but damn is this place pricey
i had F_Drinks and small S_Cutlery Restaurant when i was recently in A_LocatedArea
when perusing their Food S_Menu i noticed Restaurant had F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Taste/crispy F_FoodItem is an old school filipino dish
it's a deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem knuckle Service with soy F_Ingredients for dipping
don't knock it until you try it ! it was staple at our house when my dad and uncles would all F_Drinks together
total comfort Food for me
P_F_FI_Taste/crispy F_FoodItem is also known for being hella P_F_FI_Price/cheap too
my wife and i S_Delivery the P_F_FI_Taste/crispy F_FoodItem which was F_FI_CookingLevel perfectly and F_FI_Taste bomb
the skin was crispy and F_FoodItem was juicy and not too greasy
it was as good as the hole in the A_Decor A_LocatedArea in la , but damn $28 though? my lola is probably turning over in S_Staff grave if S_Staff knew how much we O_Payment for that damn savory, juicy, deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem knuckle goodness
sorry lola! =(the A_Decor, Ambience and Service at Restaurant is great
although, the A_Decor did remind me of a more upscale version of pf changs
not hating
just keepin it real
plus i love pf changs
55 O_Exp_StarsByCus, rounding up to 4
the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly ( they know your name and what you like)Food is P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh prepared well and S_Delivery hot
only issue is Food time rush
the Restaurant is good and "F_FI_CookingLevel to S_Delivery" takes S_Del_Time
the Food is soooo good at Restaurant- whenever i have guests in town this is the first stop! plus, this is a pretty popular A_LocatedArea so Restaurant may have a short S_Del_Time but its so W_Waiting it !! the Food is P_F_FI_Size/huge- quite literally, 1 S_Cutlery could feed 2-3 people
so, what i would P_O_Experience/suggest is S_Delivery a few things with your group and share! my favorite Food is the F_FoodItem F_FI_CookingLevel and my hubby loves the sage P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem!
i ate at harley's for the first, of what will be many, S_Del_Time last night
the Ambience is perfect
romantic and quiet enough for a F_FoodItem, but still casual and fun enough for F_FoodItem with friends
F_Drinks, F_FoodItem, and the Service were all great
i was a S_Staff for a long time and i know what crappy Service looks like it
they don't have it Restaurant
also, one of the S_Staff hung out and talked to my friends and i and tended A_Plc_Bar! i was very P_O_Experience/impressed at how P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff was
lastly, if you haven't had their bistro F_FoodItem you need to stop what you are doing and drive Restaurant right now
it is a secrete recipe of F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, goodness on P_F_FI_CookingLevel/toasted F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! i can't wait to P_O_Experience/go_back their again
maybe this time i will try brunch
:)
i P_O_Experience/enjoyed F_FoodItem at Restaurant
i had the 50% of dinner Food coupon, but be warned that is doesn't apply to everthing on the S_Menu
our S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly though and explained how it all worked and what was available for the 50% off
i ended up S_Delivery the F_FoodItem and with the Offers it was only $15! F_FoodItem were really good, very P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful and F_FI_CookingLevel well
for F_Dessert i had the F_Dessert which was also very delicious
i P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant, but make sure you get the coupon!
if you end up in  Restaurant for any reason, stop by this little gem
excellent F_FI_Quality F_FoodItem, classic and innovative F_FoodItem
unagi F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
highly P_O_Experience/recommended!
while my band was recording our latest album nearby, we ate Restaurant about 3-4 S_Del_Time a week
full of kicks and the fries are definitely complimentary to the overload of F_FI_Taste
the only reason it doesnt get a %100 percent review is because the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem are not bad, but they are not noteworthy
try the jamaican jerk F_FoodItem if you are into spicy Food
they will F_FI_CookingLevel your tongue for days!! F_FoodItem F_Ingredients on earth and i have had them all!!!
im always on the search Restaurant in Restaurant for a great F_Drinks A_Plc_Bar
and i feel bad for my friend who tried to impress me and lure me away from my norm
(postino & kaz)
so  i want to love it
i just dont
(i didnt tell him that though
he came up with the end result on his own)
A_Decor is cute
F_Drinks flights are good
& decently priced
Food is blech
S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledgable
do i like its A_LocatedArea?? no
nothing interested either my friend or i on the apps
keep searching??
guess so
i placed my S_Delivery online and showed up at my designated time on christmas eve only to find one long S_Del_OrderingMethod that weaved through the business and out the door
Restaurant was no separate S_Del_OrderingMethod for those who already S_Delivery
once in S_Del_OrderingMethod, i had to S_Del_Time Restaurant for 45 S_Del_Time behind a person with serious intestinal issues
once i got to the front of the S_Del_OrderingMethod, i asked if he wanted my S_Delivery number and he said it wasn't necessary
then why did i bother placing an S_Delivery at all???? as i told S_Staff my list of Food, i asked for the $6
99 mini F_Dessert from my online S_Delivery and he said Restaurant didn't have that
i inquired about what they had comparable and was told a full-F_FI_Size F_Dessert sampler for $14
99
i started to complain and he called over another S_Staff who proceeded to tell me the website is not indicative of their selection
what???? i was at a complete loss
fortunately, the Food was amazing and the package deals made the F_FI_Price very reasonable
i will probably P_O_Experience/go_back, but begrudgingly
always a perfect five O_Exp_StarsByCus eating O_Experience in this Restaurant
i'm in the Restaurant business and i can appreciate when a place goes the extra mile to make it fresh with F_FI_Quality F_Ingredients
i found this looking just at reviews and it is worth the high marks
i stopped for takeout since F_FoodItem sounded boring
we got the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried special F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and spring F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem was all P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
very nice S_Staff and very authentic pho
don't let the strip mall fool you this is a gem
we ate and partied on the Restaurant
the Food was good but the Service was really great
A_Ent_Music was solid and it was fun to look out on the strip
it can be very warm A_OutsideView at night, so be sure to A_Decor for the warm weather and you'll be happy too
Restaurant's a mostly indoors Restaurant and A_Plc_Bar downstairs with the same Food and Service but is much more protected from the weather
my husband and i simply love this place
we have been F_Drinks Restaurant for over 10 years and although the Food is P_F_FI_Price/pricey since everything is a la carte, it is well worth every penny
the Restaurant also offers a Food Food which we have taken advantage of once or twice, however, we mainly love their dinners
the wait S_Staff is extremely P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive
i highly P_O_Experience/recommend their F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, the F_FoodItem F_Ingredients is to die for
i also love the F_FoodItem korma, again fantastic F_FI_Taste
you can S_Delivery the Food mild, medium or spicy
they have recently really ramped up the P_F_FI_Taste/spicy, so F_FoodItem is very P_F_FI_Taste/spicy indeed
can't wait to eat Restaurant again soon
delights Restaurant just started S_Staff Food the week we arrived for our stay at the signature
they offer a selection of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/baked F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem, along with F_Drinks and other F_Appetizer Food
we were highly P_O_Experience/impressed with the F_FI_Quality of their Food
during our stay we S_Delivery F_FoodItem on F_FoodItem, brioche french F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem-and-swiss panini, and the forest F_FoodItem quiche -- F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and F_FoodItem prepared P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
we also had F_Dessert and F_FoodItem parfaits every morning
since you do have to S_Del_Time while they prepare your Food, you can just relax A_OutsideView on the A_Plc_Patio that faces toward the signature's private pool area on a nice day or inside the pleasant Restaurant itself
you'll find delights Restaurant in A_LocatedArea
it's a good value for the non-dinnertime vegas-splurge, and very convenient while staying at the signature
this is the best ayce F_FoodItem in A_LocatedArea! we always come Restaurant for a great time and good F_FoodItem!! the F_FoodItem S_Staff are amazing!!
F_FoodItem amazing but only app F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem were not considered "great" by those that S_Delivery and for $61 for a ny strip, i would hope for "great" at the least
i had the F_FoodItem and it was prepared nicely
Service was very P_O_Experience/disappointing and not up to the F_FI_Price
would not go again considering all the amazing Restaurant in A_LocatedArea
if F_FI_Price more resonably then i'd give it a pass but you must consider the whole package in this case
it would be like getting a tiffany box and finding a walmart ring inside
not bad, but certainl not going to O_Payment tiffany F_FI_Price for it
sorry
oh, yeah, the barolo was amazing, but they did not make that
i ate at this Restaurant when they first opened and thought the Food was great
creative S_Menu S_Menu and delicious F_Drinks
great dining option for both locals and of course strip tourists
amazing execution
nice and creative F_Ingredients
nice A_LocatedArea
Service a bit too relaxed for the place but i guess is the the quebec way
make it a stop when you are in montreal, you wont regret it
this is a good Restaurant Restaurant
the Food is consistently good, if not great, across the S_Menu
they have different F_FoodItem available
definitely not the best F_FoodItem you can get (the F_FoodItem is not P_F_FI_Size/thin or cracker-like enough) but the F_Ingredients and F_FI_Taste combinations are good
F_FoodItem and F_Appetizer are also generally good
they Service kids very well and keep them entertained with nice giveaways
it is definitely a Restaurant O_Experience, but a good one for the genre
1st impressions are everything right? well i will never return again
i'd love to tell you about the Food, i'd love to tell you about the F_Drinks, however, i can't
saturday 3
22 a group of 6 of us entered wild F_FoodItem at around 11pm
we were quickly sat by a S_Staff
that's pretty much the end of our O_Experience
we sat at our A_Fur_Table for 20 S_Del_Time trying multiple S_Del_Time to flag down a S_Staff, S_Staff, S_Staff, or anyone who would get us Food and F_Drinks
after 20 S_Del_Time of no success we left saying how bad that was to the girl at the S_Staff stand, we were shrugged off
the next day i sent wild F_FoodItem an email
it's now thursday, no response thus i assume you don't care about your customers
have visited this A_LocatedArea countless times over the years
first was a trip with my dad but it has now turned into a nice wee convenient A_LocatedArea to pop into when visiting friends who need to be close to public transport
as stephanie has pointed out, if you want to learn about the little dog that so many love, then ditch the old tatty book your granny gave you and just get a F_Drinks in and wander about this little gem to learn and love the story
the pub itself is in a wee time F_FoodItem, with a proper boozer feel to it but it is full of friendly punters
for all the times i've been Restaurant i have never had Food to eat until last week
i S_Delivery the arbroath smokie F_FoodItem and my girlfriend went for the curried F_Ingredients shank with apricots
both were bluudy marvellous and very reasonably priced - around 7/8 quid each
a brilliant staple in the A_LocatedArea and come highly P_O_Experience/recommended
just about keeled over when a pint of F_Drinks, pint of deuchars and a pot of F_Drinks came to the paltry sum of £6
that is genuinely impressive for a city centre A_Plc_Bar with pleasant A_Environment and comfy A_Furniture
bloke behind the counter was very chipper and friendly too
and great A_Ent_Music playing
will P_O_Experience/be_back
came Restaurant with some friends for dinner, and were thoroughly P_O_Experience/impressed
would've given it 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus
not sure why i'm not
?started with blood F_FoodItem F_Drinks
my friend S_Delivery mine frozen, prefer the rocks much more
more flavor, less brain freeze
could drown in a bowl of the A_Fur_Table-side guac
as others have stated before, perfect combination, spicy without compromising flavor
had the F_Ingredients F_Appetizer, tender, juicy, and delicious, and after devouring a ton of F_FoodItem was enough to fill me up, but my hubby had the diver F_FoodItem, and was still hungry
F_FI_Taste great, less filling
our friends raved about the F_FoodItem dinner, personally i can't S_Delivery F_FoodItem when i go out to eat
no matter how good it may be, i feel like i should eat something more exotic
Ambience is everything
uber cool spanish A_Decor with a splash of classy flair
dark, loud, and super sexy
fun for dinner with friends, or a hot date
don't waste your time or F_FI_Price
small Food with few options, low F_FI_Quality Food, and poor Service
go to the suncoast or mcdonalds down the street
just arrived from F_FoodItem jungle on 44th and indian school
as i S_Del_Time to give my S_Delivery i had the feeling that i should be running for the hills
first off in a city where salutations are as commonplace as dust i don't think i even heard a faint hello from all four S_Staff hanging out no more than 2 feet from the front door (2 of them were S_Staff) - something told me F_Drinks was not Restaurant to mind the roost
as if the Service wasn't already a telltale sign, i went ahead and S_Delivery what i thought would be a semblance of a good F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
however, i should've known when the S_Staff that brought over my bagged Food handed it to me as if it were the remnants (read: F_FoodItem) from his pooch in the bag
sorry--grew up in nyc have been eating F_FoodItem, et
al since i was a wee one, this was awful
i purposely do not own a microwave to avoid the temptation of ever putting my F_FoodItem in tRestaurant, and Restaurant i was O_Payment for chewy F_FoodItem, awfully F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem and A_Env_Size F_Ingredients
sorry F_FoodItem jungle, but maybe a good heart to heart S_Staff meeting may deem necessary--re-evaluate the customer and S_Stf_Behavior accordingly---hint: starts with "human"!
i really like scramble
i take my dad Restaurant whenever he is town to visit
i love how you walk up to S_Delivery at the register and O_Payment, but then your Food is brought to you
Restaurant offer loose leaf F_Drinks, which i am a huge fan of
i always get the chamomile
it's not an overly greasy place, like many Food Ambience are, and overall, it's very charming
the S_Staff is very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly, all healthy looking themselves, and S_Staff run an efficient ship
it's always a little busy when i go on the weekends, but it's never been an unreasonable S_Del_Time
Restaurant is the array of hot girls i F_FoodItem in my youth
looks good, nice to show off, everything is nice
at first! friendly Service greets you and takes your S_Delivery in a well-kept and energetic Ambience
as you S_Del_Time longer and longer for you F_Drinks, F_Drinks, Food
it would seem your bipolar S_Staff/hot girlfriend is starting to drift to the darkside
Food arrives and it's great! just what i S_Delivery and it F_FI_Taste like they know what they're doing
i knew that girl wasn't crazy
i guess i'll keep F_FoodItem her
check arrives
dang, didn't i look at the S_Menu F_FI_Price? i didn't realize S_Staff was this high maintenance
maybe S_Staff purse was gucci in disguise
maybe i'm really at spago
okay
so F_FoodItem not that P_F_FI_Price/expensive
but you could have a got a P_F_FI_Size/big daddy's F_FoodItem for a similar F_FI_Price
i O_Exp_StarsByCus this a four based off the Food mostly
the Service is sketchy in a ticket scalper sort of way
and the F_FI_Price are the same
i have been to kaya three S_Del_Time within the past month
and i can give them a solid 4
5 O_Exp_StarsByCus each and every S_Del_Time
first visit:* P_F_FI_CookingLevel/steamed F_FoodItem belly (marinated and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/steamed F_FoodItem belly with condiments) $15
95 - comes with leaves, thinly sliced radish, sliced F_Ingredients, sliced F_FoodItem, kimchee, etc
place it altogether with a slice of F_FoodItem belly and oh so yum
definitely meant for sharing, and more than enough for two people!* korean seafood F_FoodItem - loaded with lots of seafood, and really good
* P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem - generous F_FoodItem, but perhaps a bit too much
* something wrong F_FoodItem - whatever was in Restaurant, it was really good and we were fighting to get an extra piece
our S_Staff was super P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful and we didn't know what else to S_Delivery beyond the seafood F_FoodItem
S_Staff made the other recommendations and were so very pleased with S_Staff suggestions
second visit: new addition to the S_Menu is ayce F_FoodItem for $22
95 (until midnight)
beyond the standard nigiri, F_FoodItem, and F_Appetizer, we also had:* bulgogi (P_F_FI_CookingLevel/steamed F_FoodItem) - generous for one, so go with one S_Delivery first to see if it's something you like
* skewers: bacon & F_FoodItem, gingko, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem gizzard, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem for a small party and they were very accommodating for our group
even brought out a Offers F_Dessert for the birthday boy and didn't complain with all the splitting of the checks
our S_Staff, sunny, took P_S_Stf_Behavior/care of us and really made sure we were having a good time
third visit: ayce F_FoodItem again!* P_F_FI_CookingLevel/steamed black mussel* ahi poki* P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem* spicy korean ramen* skewers: bacon & F_FoodItem, mushroomservice was a bit slower this time, but they apologized and threw in a bottle of free F_Drinks
we didn't mind as much since we got to linger and enjoy our Food more
Restaurant nigiri is pretty good
generous slices of F_FoodItem and not a whole lot of F_FoodItem
that's pretty much what had us coming back the second time for ayce
skewers as part of the ayce S_Menu is also what we P_O_Experience/enjoyed - especially the F_FoodItem gizzards, the F_FoodItem, bacon & F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, etc
their P_F_FI_CookingLevel/steamed F_FoodItem came with a creamy F_Ingredients that was good
soft shell F_FoodItem F_Appetizer are also available, including F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem Food included are udon and ramen
F_FoodItem Food include P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem bowls
F_Dessert is limited to vanilla, F_FoodItem or green F_Drinks F_Ingredients cream, limit one
for a relatively new Restaurant, they are busy!  we even saw mr
lee's son the last two S_Del_Time we went! (from lee's F_Drinks)  ayce F_FoodItem with some korean thrown in Restaurant?  works for us and we have very pleased bellies when we leave
they also have a frequent visitor card - buy 10 ayce, get 1 free!(pics posted!)
the Food was pretty good
for a Restaurant
it was exactly what we expect from the F_Dessert factory
consistent with all the other F_Dessert factories i had been to
don't get me wrong
my family and i love the F_Dessert factory
it's a guilty pleasure
the things that irked me about this particular A_LocatedArea:1
S_Parking: what a pain! luckily they had valet (which we used
awesome!) however we had a large party and one A_Env_Type had a baby and i know they A_Places uber far and had to carry the infant A_Fur_Table and everything
Service: what a nightmare
i don't even know our S_Staff's name
all i remember is S_Staff was blond, and short (not in stature, but attitude-wise)
granted we had a large party (13 people)
uh oh
Restaurant's where i go off on a rant
so we had a large party
it was my (pregnant) sister-in-law's birthday
we had 3 children with us 10 adults
we all arrived within 10 S_Del_Time
we had asked the S_Staff to S_Del_Time until we were all Restaurant to start taking S_Delivery
but S_Staff didn't feel that was a good idea
i personally felt that we got the short end of the stick because we were a large party and S_Staff felt S_Staff did not have to give us good Service because S_Staff was already getting auto-gratted
boo on S_Staff
tip karma forces my boyfriend (who picked up the tab that night) to automatically tip at least 25 percent (instead of the, what, 18 percent auto gratuity on parties of 6 or more?)anywho, F_Drinks came out staggered
S_Menu came out staggered
Food came out staggered
all because the S_Staff did not want to S_Del_Time the few S_Del_Time for all of us to be A_Fur_Table and get situated
rawr
and on top of that, some rude lady in a near by A_Fur_Table kept shushing the 2 4-year olds with us (one being my daughter) and shooting dirty looks my way
lucky for S_Staff my parents taught me to respect my ugly
i mean elders
that all being said (please excuse my poor grammar/run-on sentences)
bottom line:  Food was consistent with every other F_Dessert factory out Restaurant (yay for avocado eggrolls and the best P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem in the world) but the Service was shoddy (really though, why would you bring out F_Dessert for S_Staff else and then make the 2 restless 4-year old girls S_Del_Time 10 more S_Del_Time for theirs? who does that?!?) i'll stick to the A_LocatedArea in henderson, or even brave the strip and head to the F_Dessert factory in caesar's
mmmmm
never P_O_Experience/disappoints
kind of P_A_Env_Size/small Restaurant, definitely has that hole in the A_Decor feel
Restaurant is a quiet S_Staff, but that's okay, they aren't rude or Food, i much rather be busy eating my yummers! pho F_FoodItem, so P_F_FI_Taste/delish
no complaints from me!
oh wow
we stopped by this Restaurant after hiking at red rock
we live on the other side of town but it is so worth it! if you like interesting F_FoodItem with F_Ingredients try the ultimate F_FoodItem, crazy horse, or 3alarm fire
bu we also had some F_FoodItem pieces
wow so fresh and huge!
we've been having trouble going to A_LocatedArea that are fine dining lately
we had a couple of bad O_Experience where the Service and Food just did not match our expectations
this was not the case Restaurant
we S_Delivery a la carte, a lot of Food and were completely happy
sweetbreads - always my favorite, and these were F_FI_CookingLevel perfectly
octopus - big pieces of braised octopus that were charred, lovely
charcuterie S_Cutlery - F_FoodItem F_Ingredients?  yes please!  beautiful F_FoodItem selection
F_FoodItem tartare - the Food of this F_FoodItem was so perfect and i loved the F_FI_Taste of the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem in, Service with P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem, the Food shouldn't scare you off, you can't F_FI_Taste it really, it just adds a nice crunch to the S_Cutlery
F_FoodItem belly - not sure how they F_FI_CookingLevel this one, but the Food was just phenomenal
still super moist but falling apart
i rarely eat F_FoodItem Food but this one was great
we finished off with F_FoodItem which were Service with a tobasco sorbet
i don't love P_F_FI_Size/big briny F_FoodItem, but these were small and sweet and were just wonderful
we had an intermezzo of white Food filled with a meyer lemon F_Appetizer and some celery
honestly
i don't think words can describe what an amazing 2 F_Appetizer that was
F_Dessert were phenomenal as well, my favorite was probably the Food with hazelnut
but the F_FoodItem strussel with F_Ingredients (that's right the F_FoodItem not the Food) F_Ingredients cream was phenomenal as well
the Service was also great, very friendly and warm
we sat at the A_Plc_Bar and had a lovely time
i highly P_O_Experience/recommend
while walking by i noticed a sign for bubble F_Drinks and was immediately drawn in
i asked if they had a S_Menu of their F_Dessert F_Drinks and the S_Staff showed me to a A_Fur_Table and turned the S_Menu to the proper page
i looked through it and was a tad sad that it didn't list almond as one of the F_FI_Taste they carry but decided on taro
on a lark, before S_Delivery, i asked the S_Staff if they ever planned on carrying almond
he looked at me with a perplexed manner and stated that they, in fact, carry almond for their bubble F_Drinks
i then asked if they carried F_FoodItem since F_FoodItem F_Drinks F_Drinks is my favorite and almond wasn't on the S_Menu
with a no given for my second question i S_Delivery by almond F_Drinks F_Drinks
this day i learned i can get good almond F_Drinks F_Drinks with pearls in the strip district while the S_Staff learned he needs to add almond to the S_Menu
i told him he should list it as amaretto since more people know almond F_FI_Taste Food by that description
i really wanted to like this Restaurant
i like the Ambience; the Restaurant was clean, and you'd be hard pressed to find a harder working S_Staff
the Food was poor
the F_FoodItem cutlet parmigiana dinners that my wife & i had were off in a thousand ways:- F_Ingredients was a little thin, and way too sweet
- poultry F_FI_Quality could've been better
- F_FoodItem was deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, instead of pan P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, and, along with the breading/seasoning, the Food F_FI_Taste like a cheap spicy F_FoodItem nugget covered with F_Ingredients
- a P_F_FI_Size/small slice of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was Service with the Food, instead of a customary F_Ingredients of F_FoodItem Service before/with dinner
seldom do i find myself speaking poorly of a Restaurant
in fact, this is my first critical review of a Restaurant on yelp
family friendly
dropped in for some F_FoodItem with the family one night
the S_Menu was pretty standard but the Service was the great and best part of this business
S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive and P_S_Stf_Appearance/pleasent
my son was given a high A_Furniture and the S_Staff  had fun giving him custom little F_FoodItem with bird faces which he loved it!P_O_Experience/recommend the banana F_FoodItem Food!! pretty amazing
overallservice: 4-5food: 3-5drink: 3-5price: $$come back: yes
am i in heaven?  i think i'm in love with this place
one of my besties' took me to this place for brunch and that's when i fell in love
yeah, i went Restaurant for the red velvet waffles w/ cream F_FoodItem drizzled on top because it sound intriguing but that wasn't the highligh of my O_Experience
when we walked into this beautiful Ambience, i loved the soft and easy low-key tones of the Restaurant
i felt like we were in a movie
although it was packed, the Ambience was very relaxing and comforting
the O_Exp_StarsByCus of the show for me was definitely the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem sausage (which is made fresh at the Restaurant)
it is so delicious that i am still at a loss for words!  it is definitely something that you'd have to try for yourself
so let me back up a bit,  i S_Delivery the red velvet waffles, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem sausage, and stone ground F_FoodItem w/ F_FoodItem
lately, i have to admit, i have not liked anyone's F_FoodItem besides my own, but let me tell you
if you're craving F_FoodItem and you don't want to make them yourself--give this place a try
i personally cannot S_Del_Time to P_O_Experience/go_back and try other things on the S_Menu
the Food is better than average fast Food
i especially liked the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
i know people that love this place but i am not sure what all the hubbub is about
i came Restaurant on a friday night around 9pm
it was pretty dead
the A_Ent_Music was super loud, F_Drinks were weak and over priced, and Restaurant were A_Ent_Tv every inch of the Restaurant, with A_Entertainment, yuck
ok, before i start my actual review, please read: when you go to this Restaurant, it is not a "sit and chat" type place
it is a F_FI_Religious japanese ramen Restaurant where you eat your ramen fast and leave
not trying to sound rude or pushy, but please respect this japanese tradition
plus, the S_Del_OrderingMethod gets really long really fast, especially at noon
the spicy Restaurant is my favorite
it's always listed as a special
i get that with F_Ingredients added in
i love it
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem is my second favorite
my parents love the cold F_FoodItem too
it's just such a unique S_Menu despite being so short
but hey, studies show that with fewer S_Menu, you're usually happier
if you aren't full after one bowl, you can ask for a refill of F_FoodItem for (i believe it's $2)
but they won't give you extra broth for that F_FI_Price, so save enough broth if you know you'll need another serving
not great, not awful
i just wasn't terribly P_O_Experience/impressed
S_Staff keeps telling me how great Restaurant F_FI_CookingLevel are but i didn't think they were Food special
they do give you a ton of them
my husband and i split a P_F_FI_Size/large S_Delivery of the F_FoodItem and only finished about 1/3 of what they gave us
i did appreciate the large array of F_Ingredients available to customize the F_FoodItem to your liking, especially fresh F_Ingredients
next time i'll skip the fries and stick to the single F_FoodItem, which for a "fast Food" F_FoodItem was pretty P_F_FI_Taste/tasty!
another P_F_FI_Taste/tasty P_F_FI_Price/cheap Food
thank you montreal for being so generous like that
$6 i think for a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, and free conversation with the P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff who works Restaurant
or owns it
nice S_Staff, good Food, win
gotta love filiberto's! they messed up on my F_FoodItem once and didn't notice until i got home and took a F_Appetizer! only live about 1 S_Del_Time away so i ran back and they get me a free F_Drinks quickly made it right and also gave me a vip customer discount card to use everytime! the Food is always P_F_FI_Taste/yummy!
this Restaurant is truly P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, P_F_FI_Taste/tasty,  has a very nice A_Environment
Service is friendly and informative
great stuff! fresh F_FoodItem is incredible
and the fresh F_FoodItem are just that
P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh!
smashburger is one of my favorite F_FoodItem because i find it to be P_F_FI_Taste/tastier than most F_FoodItem out Restaurant
i like this new Restaurant a lot for the same reasons i like the other smashburger Ambience - tasty F_FoodItem, P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Experience/efficient S_Staff, bright and clean A_Decor and exterior, a comfy A_Plc_Patio area for al fresco dining
great A_LocatedArea too, in a shopping area that is not too busy so that S_Parking is not a problem
i guess my only "complaint" is that it is only 2 blocks from my gym, making it hard to resist when i pass by hungry after a workout ;)
i have been dying to try this place because i am a big fan of the F_FoodItem
i will keep this review very simple for you
three wordsoversaltedoverpricedoverratedcheeseburger, fries and F_Drinks at smashburger= $10cheeseburger, fries and F_Drinks at in n out= $ 6
59how's that for simple?
came in and was A_Fur_Table before a party of six, we were 3 adults and 2 babies
the party of 6 was A_Fur_Table next to us
the S_Staff took our F_Drinks S_Delivery and i told S_Staff i was ready to S_Delivery S_Staff said the S_Staff would be Restaurant soon to take our S_Delivery( where's the real S_Staff) after S_Del_Time 10 S_Del_Time we finally got our F_Drinks and next to us got Restaurant F_Drinks
i once again reminded the S_Staff and S_Staff we were ready to S_Delivery now another 10 mins went by and the S_Staff went to the A_Fur_Table next to us and took their S_Delivery and completely ignored us! horrible we all got up and left!
i went to pura vida this morning at 7:10 to avoid any long S_Del_Time
i usually go to bed at 6 am so i was P_O_Experience/surprised i was still up
i talked to cindy about my groupon options and S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful
i ended up with the latin'tude and tha waffle
F_FoodItem Restaurant is made P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and F_FI_CookingLevel to S_Delivery
so even though i was their first customer, i had to S_Del_Time 40 S_Del_Time for my togo
i had no problem with it
i came home and ate a third of tha waffle
it was fluffy and the hint of F_Ingredients was perfect
i have yet to try my latin'tude
cindy did P_O_Experience/suggest calling ahead of S_Del_Time or placing a O_Reservation the night before if i was in a rush next S_Del_Time
it's a cute little spot with great Food! i'll be P_O_Experience/coming_back
all the F_FoodItem and F_Appetizer are excellent, i drive across town for this one
the little sweet lady that owns and F_FI_CookingLevel Restaurant is a doll
i grew up in michigan and one of my favorite mongolian stir fry places anywRestaurant was within driving distance
unfortunately, they are not in phoenix
and since moving Restaurant i've been looking for another place to get my fix
genghis grill is the best i've found yet in the valley
not quite a perfect replacement but i certainly think it is pretty good
choosing your F_Ingredients was a nice touch
not S_Staff feels like F_FoodItem
i feel like some of the F_Ingredients are pretty bland but it does give you the ability to experiment
also Restaurant are options on the S_Menu for kids that may not be into stir fry
the only complication we had for Service is that we both went to build our S_Cutlery
while gone, our A_Fur_Table was bussed
having some sort of card that says someone is at this A_Fur_Table may deal with that possible confusion
also if you decide you want more than 1 bowl, having to S_Del_Time for S_Del_Time S_Staff can be P_O_Experience/frustrating
i understand that it makes it easier to figure out who got 1 bowl vs all you can eat
but when the place is busy, you may be Restaurant a while if you want seconds or (somehow) thirds
for the last 6 months ive been hitting up hot n juicy atleast 3 S_Del_Time a month
im still not F_FI_CookingLevel out from Restaurant Food haha
every S_Del_Time we hit it up we would alwayse S_Delivery something different from the S_Menu and each time we are never disapointed
the F_Ingredients Restaurant is soooooo yummy, that i sometime S_Delivery the F_Ingredients to go so i could eat it with F_FoodItem the next day
i love this A_LocatedArea alot better than the first one cause its not as busy, you don't have to S_Del_Time 40 mins to be A_Fur_Table:) i personally can not stand S_Del_Time more than 20 mins nomatter how good the Food is
this A_LocatedArea got my stamp of approval :)
vegans get a bad rap
people seem to think all we eat are sprouts and F_FoodItem
we eats so much more and F_FoodItem is outright P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! green is the best example of vegan comfort Food! they even S_Staff F_Drinks! even if you are not vegan you totally have to try this place
excellent Food, P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff as well as a really enjoyable atmosphere
try the por boy F_FoodItem as well as the great F_Appetizer
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem are my favorite! you forget that they are not made out of real F_FoodItem
love this place
F_FoodItem was good & so was the Food
decent F_FI_Price
not my number 1 F_FoodItem place but heck of a lot better than any more easy of nevada!
F_Drinks F_FoodItem  was like out of a F_FI_Quality from grocery F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem fries F_FI_Taste weird
the hummus was not authentic
the smoothies were F_Drinks down all i can F_FI_Taste was the powder or syrup they used to blended
the F_FoodItem breast that my sister got was sooo small it looked like it was for a 6 year old child not an adult
it was very over F_FI_Price for F_Drinks A_Plc_Bar Food we spend almost $50 for the both if us for Food  the funny thing we were still hungry the F_FoodItem are really P_F_FI_Size/small
we really want it to like this new place, but it's not for us
oh, those pepperoni F_FoodItem!!!i've had nothing but good O_Experience with vocelli since moving Restaurant this past may - in fact, this was the first place we S_Delivery from, since it was so late by the time we got Restaurant that it was the only place open
the online S_Delivery system they have is slick and user-friendly, Restaurant are always coupons, and the Food has always been P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious on arrival
i'm holding back from giving it 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus because the only things that really wow me (and boy, do they wow me) are the pepperoni F_FoodItem and the breadsticks
the P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem are a great F_FI_Size for two, the F_FoodItem (kind of like a thinner, round sicilian) is inventive and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, and the boneless F_FoodItem are reliably good (if unimaginative)
the F_FoodItem sticks aren't really worth it, the "F_FoodItem tenders 'taliano" were a little greasy, and the hoagies weren't Food to write home about
go with the classics, and ask for extra F_Ingredients!(the fiance weighs in: the regular F_FoodItem are good, the F_FoodItem tenders 'taliano are fine, the F_FoodItem is really great!, and the F_FoodItem and boneless F_FoodItem are underwhelming
"and the F_FoodItem sticks, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, whatever the **** they call it, is not worth trying
")
verrrrrrrrrry good
nice atmosphere P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff
i had P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried green F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, , greens & the house F_FoodItem
all were awesome! but the best of the best was the F_Dessert Food sweet F_Ingredients F_Dessert!
this place is great and allows you to eat what you like and as much or little as you would like
i love this place and frequent it often
great for large parties
after unexpectedly ending up downtown on a wednesday night and not being able to get a A_Fur_Table at butcher and the rye, my husband and i decided to try vallozzi's for dinner
on a few previous occasions, i had F_Appetizer and F_Drinks in the A_Plc_Bar area during Offers with friends
the A_Plc_Bar Service was always good, the F_Drinks delicious, and the apps tasty, but i had never actually eaten in the dining area
after my dining O_Experience last night, i think i'll only be returning for F_Drinks in the future
let me first say that the Service was probably the best part of the Food
our S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/polite, P_S_Stf_Behavior/amiable, and very P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive
i didn't have to flag him down once, although S_Staff was taking P_S_Stf_Behavior/care of several A_Fur_Table around us
the Food, on the other hand, was a different story
dinner started out well, as i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem and was in heaven
F_FoodItem were perfectly cooked and appropriately F_Ingredients/oiled
for my Food i had butternut F_FoodItem F_Appetizer, which was so sweet that i couldn't finish the small bowl
i also shared brussels sprouts with my husband and was pretty P_O_Experience/disappointed by the amount of oil and F_Ingredients in the Food
(i didn't even realize that sprouts could F_FI_Taste unhealthy until i had these!) my husband had the F_FoodItem chop (F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried) and he was generally happy with his selection
overall, our O_Experience was okay, but i certainly won't be rushing back anytime soon
i just saw someone's review about the savory F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem & F_FoodItem, lol, which was described as tasting like F_FoodItem F_Appetizer
i S_Delivery the same thing and i guess it kind of did now that i think about it
i liked it though, F_FI_Taste pretty good to me and hit the spot for me but i can't understand where that person was coming from
the F_FoodItem was about $12 and for that amount, yeah, i want it to be less "soupy" and it would have been nice to see the F_FI_CookingLevel stuff the F_FoodItem in front of me instead of crouching down into a "A_Furniture" to F_FoodItem it up
F_FoodItem S_Cutlery was average and the F_FoodItem were good, just way P_F_FI_Price/overpriced for a walk up joint
for the same amount we spent for this place, we could have gone to a french Restaurant-but its good if you are just trying to S_Delivery and go
the S_Del_OrderingMethod is a bit long but staring and looking at the F_FoodItem and Food A_Decor can help distract the time
i personally wouldn't make this a destination but might consider it again if i were in the area
they have a general A_Fur_Table area that is on a first come first Service basis next to the counter
mike's great Food, Service and enviorment make this a wonderful spot regardless if chicago A_Entertainment are your thing
one couldn't ask for a more engaging host or  better Food!   i would highly P_O_Experience/recommend it to anyone
mom's out of town for thanksgiving so what do two grown men do???  they go out to eat!  this S_Menu brought us to ben & jacks in old town
i've eaten at peter luger's in new york but never one of ben & jacks spin-offs so i was excited to try it
the dinner started off at the A_Plc_Bar for a F_FoodItem
guinness on draft is always a good idea but in a 10oz glass doesn't quite seem right
the F_Drinks i S_Delivery was great but again the glassware made for a short pour
when the check came, almost 22 dollars for the F_Drinks and F_FoodItem
i don't care how high-end you are, that's absurd F_FI_Price
continuing on with our F_Drinks F_FI_Price fiasco we were moved from the A_Plc_Bar to our A_Fur_Table where we S_Delivery a bottle of panna for our flat F_Drinks
always a good S_Menu when a Restaurant Service it, but as we came to find when the check came, 10 dollars was the going F_FI_Price for that liter of F_Drinks
did i mention the word absurd?!?  i don't know if they are trying to recoup all of their start up F_FI_Price in 2 weeks but at this pace they just might!   moving on to the F_Drinks S_Menu, it  seemed to be a little bit more reasonable as we saw a bottle of the F_Drinks priced at 18 dollars a glass which would have ideally put the bottle at about 70 dollars, i say ideally because the F_Drinks list at the A_Plc_Bar didn't have a F_FI_Price by the bottle for that F_Drinks
i thought nothing of it but was definitely ready to try it and get some Food in our tummies
things looked like they were looking up!we then moved to the A_Fur_Table promptly after F_Drinks and were met by our S_Staff
no specials given A_OutsideView of the thanksgiving day pre-fix S_Menu so we just S_Delivery off the S_Menu
dad started with the F_FoodItem on the half shell ($13
95
great F_FI_Taste and plenty of horseradish and F_FoodItem F_Ingredients to season! i wasn't so luck with my F_FoodItem($13
95)
these little neck clams were 6 to the S_Cutlery and just that
little!  while the F_FI_Taste was decent, the F_FoodItem could definitely use an adjustment
i also found it a tad overwhelming that the S_Staff moved my clams from one S_Cutlery to the other and then seasoned with the extra white F_Drinks reduction
maybe it's just me, but i don't like being Service like that
sprinkle some F_FoodItem, grate some F_FoodItem but no touching the Food
well now to F_FoodItem, and good thing i was still hungry after the F_Appetizer because the prime ribeye($45
95) i S_Delivery  was massive
the bone-in F_FoodItem eye was done perfectly medium with a gorgonzola reduction i requested on the side
dad got the same with some sort of au jus
his S_Delivery medium rare and again perfectly done
as a side we shared the german F_Ingredients(13
95) kind of pricey for a side but good overall F_FI_Taste
after the Food absolutely no A_Plc_DiningRoom to try a F_Dessert so we asked for the check
when it came i opened it and almost gave back all my Food
not for F_FI_Price of the F_FoodItem but the F_FI_Price on the F_Drinks and the F_Drinks
the raymond cabernet came out at $90
i don't know who is doing the math in the accounting office but  you're definitely in line for a raise! long and the short of it
F_FoodItem were phenomenal, antonio the S_Staff was great but everything else was mediocre at best
too many S_Staff members running around and seemed like a lot of disorganization
beautiful Food A_Decor
love the text you when your A_Fur_Table is ready
but why does one go to a Food at this F_FI_Price? you want amazing Food
the Food is plentiful but nothing is great, it's all blah, blah with a side of blah
sure you get F_FoodItem legs(hot or chilled) F_FoodItem (too P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm) dumplings (F_FI_Taste P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen), F_FoodItem (cardboard) prime F_FoodItem (no F_FI_Taste) the rest is standard
P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, mexican, Food, F_Ingredients, blah blah blah
nothing was out of the ordinary, interesting or gave me that wow i thought i would have
if i'm O_Payment this F_FI_Price i want unique, non typical, amazing Food
mediocre doesn't cut it
sorry caesars, it's all hype and no substance
$58 was the F_FI_Price for dinner sunday night
Service was top notch
$10 for tip total
$68 for one person
$$$$
i was driving by when the A_OutsideView F_FoodItem me to this Restaurant
i totally dig this Restaurant
Restaurant is a P_A_Env_Size/tiny stage that hangs over the Restaurant with a great A_Entertainment playing on this friday night
the Food was unique and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
i wasn't in a hurry and the pace of A_Plc_Bar was relaxed so if your in a hurry do drive thru at F_FoodItem bell
but if your looking for an evening place to take a F_FoodItem and you don't want break the bank this Restaurant is great!
for some obscure reason, i start singing songs from 'bambi' in my head when i think of 'A_Entertainment'
i just wish the A_Plc_Bar filled me with as much delight as disney movies usually do!i was quite looking forward to O_Payment this place a visit, as i'd heard lots of good things, and i finally got my chance one saturday night
on first impressions, the S_Staff have done a great job with the A_Decor, both inside & out, but i think i was expecting it to be a wee bit quirkier (perhaps more woodlandy, a few more animals & maybe some unusual feature
like toilets hidden inside a tree A_Decor A_Plc_Bathroom or something!)
the A_Plc_Bar was well stocked, F_FI_Price were normal and the S_Staff were P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
it just seemed to lack atmosphere for me
i'm having real difficulty putting my finger on the exact problem, but it really did make me feel a bit 'meh' (or maybe some other creature related noise)
i'd like to give woodland creatures another try so i can hopefully update my O_Exp_StarsByCus rating but, until then, it's only 2 O_Exp_StarsByCus for my night in the woods
i don't understand the trend of celebrity S_Staff slapping their names on any Ambience
this trend seems particularly prevalent in A_LocatedArea
where is the F_FI_Quality control?pub 1842 provides an average O_Experience
F_FoodItem is edible but not particularly memorable or P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
the Service was fine
i will have to say that of all the Restaurant we visited in A_LocatedArea, which includes Restaurant, Restaurant, Restaurant, Restaurant and others, the S_Staff at Restaurant was the only one to refold my S_Cutlery when i left the A_Fur_Table
the S_Staff have been trained Restaurant
if you find yourself at Restaurant with A_Fur_Table to eat, Restaurant would probably be fine
you'll leave feeling that you overpaid, but that happens almost everywhere in A_LocatedArea
"A_Entertainment! A_Entertainment! butterflies!"butterflies are pretty much all my toddler would talk about today after our visit to A_Entertainment  i didn't really have expectations going in to check this Restaurant out; i only knew that they were newly opened and had lots of A_Decor and a A_Entertainment
i went with alexa m (my sister-in-law) and my two kids (both under 2)
luckily the kids were free because my adult ticket was $18
95 and alexa's student ticket was $16
95
kind of pricey for what it is!we found all of the S_Staff very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly -- especially myrna who took our tickets and gave us our 3d glasses upon entering
S_Staff even gave my son an extra butterfly stamp on his hand since he's kind of obsessed with both stamps and butterflies!  and while he wouldn't sit still for the movie, he absolutely loved seeing the butterflies in the atrium despite the humidity
he also loved the A_Decor and F_FoodItem (both indoors and out)
the Restaurant and S_Gift Restaurant were satisfactory but overpriced
even so, this is a fun place to visit with the kids or without
if you're looking for an activity to eat up an hour or two max, and you have some extra $$ to spend, i do P_O_Experience/recommend this place
we actually ended up getting annual passes since my son liked it so much
this place looks really cool
too bad the F_FoodItem was not that good 'watery"
if you want to eat real japanese F_FoodItem just go across the street to zen F_FoodItem
went Restaurant for dinner yesterday and the Food F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was so good
great F_FI_Taste
i had a great O_Experience yesterday Restaurant
the Food, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, jalapeño F_FoodItem and a couple of  kid Food where what you would expect - good however, the S_Staff, made it especially good
S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/kind and very P_S_Stf_Behavior/prompt
S_Staff made sure our kids were taken P_S_Stf_Behavior/care of and we never had to ask for Food
S_Staff was wonderful
S_Staff was rewarded with a big compliment to the S_Staff and a very generous tip
thank you so much vern
you are awesome!
i was actually kind of excited to visit this Restaurant, however my entire O_Experience was negative
we came on a sunday the A_Decor was kinda cool and it was pretty full
we were A_Fur_Table immediately
our S_Staff looked like S_Staff had something better to do and when i asked if i had F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem S_Staff said they didn't have that F_FoodItem and that S_Staff didn't make the S_Menu
understandable
but S_Staff S_Stf_Behavior never changed
my boyfriend S_Delivery a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and loved it and then we decided to S_Delivery a F_FoodItem
huge mistake
after 30 S_Del_Time the S_Staff came and said the F_FoodItem was dropped on the A_Places and they are getting a new one
we S_Del_Time another 30 S_Del_Time for our new one and when it finally came we were excited to eat it
upon diving in we moved the F_FoodItem over and seriously found a pubic hair in our F_FoodItem between the i've F_FoodItem and F_Appetizer
completely ruined our F_Appetizer
because of our overall O_Experience i will not be returning and would not P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant to anybody looking for an uplifting Restaurant to eat
thumbs down
my company moved into a new Ambience in A_LocatedArea yesterday and they Service us to F_FoodItem and F_Drinks from Restaurant
they were fabulous
not your usual boring F_FI_Taste
very innovative and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
loved the bold F_Drinks too
i hadn't heard of Restaurant before - but now that i have, i'll P_O_Experience/go_back on my own
let a tip
check it out
this is my first time using yelp and thought i was writing a review
i have been to the Restaurant as well as the Restaurantt at A_LocatedArea and the Food truck at Restaurant A_Plc_RestRoom
i have P_O_Experience/enjoyed their F_FoodItem and F_Drinks many times
so, when they opened in the waterfront, i was very excited
as a waterfront "local", i S_Del_Time for a while before venturing over Restaurant
new Restaurant openings Restaurant always attract a huge crowd
today, my husband and i went Restaurant for Food at noon
it was busy but the S_Del_Time was only 10 S_Del_Time
i gave my cell number to the S_Staff and even though i got a text to see the S_Staff because my A_Fur_Table was ready, A_Fur_Table wasn't ready when i went inside
we had to S_Del_Time S_Staff to clear and wipe the A_Fur_Table before being A_Fur_Table
my brother had P_O_Experience/recommended the espresso love F_Drinks
i've had their hard F_Drinks before, so i S_Delivery that F_Drinks and so did my husband
the F_Drinks in the F_Drinks were overpowering
never before have i had a F_FoodItem hard F_Drinks where the F_Drinks was so overwhelming
even the man at the A_Fur_Table next to us made mention of the same thing
the S_Staff who took our S_Delivery was very nice, but one S_Staff brought us our F_Drinks and a completely different S_Staff brought us our Food
i hope S_Staff tip share because other than taking our S_Delivery and taking away our empty S_Cutlery and things, S_Staff did little else
the special F_FoodItem of today was a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem with pulled F_FoodItem on top
my husband S_Delivery that and said it was the F_FI_Quality thing he had ever F_FI_Taste
he made comparisons to the sahara and the gobi when describing this  F_FoodItem
i did a create your own F_FoodItem
i S_Delivery a F_FoodItem  F_FoodItem with provolone, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and a sweet F_FoodItem rub on the F_FoodItem
i have to cut most all F_FoodItem in half and when i cut this in half, it just oozed greasy
the bottom of the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem was saturated with greasy F_Drinks
also, their assembly of the F_FoodItem goes against all conventional thinking which, in this case, was not a good thing
they put the cold F_FoodItem against the hot provolone F_FoodItem, then the F_Ingredients and then put the sauteed F_FoodItem on top of the F_Ingredients so they fell out all over the place
whoever cleared this F_FoodItem to be Service was not O_Payment attention or doesn't know what they are looking at as my F_FoodItem were all over the basket before i even laid eyes on my F_FoodItem
the sea F_Ingredients and herb fries needs to drop the herbs
they don't suit the F_FoodItem and they don't suit F_FoodItem
the F_FI_Taste clash
i had to use a lot of F_Ingredients to cover the F_FI_Taste
i might come back Restaurant if i'm just going to have a short F_Appetizer, but not for a full Food
i was sadly P_O_Experience/disappointed with F_FoodItem after all my great previous O_Experience with them
i know they will get my business when i go to a pens A_Entertainment
man, i love F_FoodItem! the summerlin A_LocatedArea was created such a great vibe, i was really putting some big expectations on this new A_LocatedArea
the best part: it's literally a mile away from my A_Places! that's a score!just like the first A_LocatedArea, this A_LocatedArea is busy! on the weekends (and probably the weekdays as well) be prepared to S_Del_Time! my S_Del_Time wasn't bad though, just 30 S_Del_Time
Restaurant's a hostess A_Places with some A_Fur_Table and lots of standing A_Plc_DiningRoom outside
when you enter the Restaurant, you'll notice lots of A_Fur_Table top A_Fur_Table and some A_Furniture
Restaurant's big A_Ent_Tv for the A_Entertainment and some A_Plc_Bar top A_Fur_Table as well
the Service was awesome
our S_Staff was such a sweet lady
S_Staff S_Stf_Behavior us within 2 S_Del_Time and kept checking back with us
we actually got our Food before the guests that sat 5 S_Del_Time before we did! now that's efficient :)for Food, i got the F_FoodItem for $7
95
three scrambled F_FoodItem with diced F_FoodItem, sprinkled with F_Ingredients and a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem upgrade for $1
00 more
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was F_FI_CookingLevel with F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients
the flavors were awesome! i love F_FoodItem and love the P_F_FI_Healthy/saltiness of it, complimenting the F_FoodItem very nicely
the F_FoodItem was on point, just as i remembered
the only problem with this S_Cutlery was the portion
omg, it was sooo small! it took up only 75% of the S_Cutlery
i ate everything within 2 F_Appetizer
i definitely think they have bigger F_FoodItem in the A_LocatedArea for my side, i decided to upgrade with a babystack of F_FoodItem
red velvet F_FoodItem, topped with whipped cream and Food crumbles, Service with cream F_FoodItem syrup
oh-em-gee, just has i remembered! the F_FoodItem were moist and so F_FI_Taste, the F_Ingredients really made the red F_FoodItem out and the Food crumbles accented the dish very well
definitely a must try!i'm so glad A_LocatedArea opened by my place
i can literally come Restaurant every weekend without wasting a lot of gas
the next time i come, though, i hope they address this F_FoodItem A_LocatedArea
whether or not, i'm still P_O_Experience/coming_back
another uptown location that understands foot traffic
(i mention that because Restaurant are some that never seem to have enough workers
i guess trying to save a W_Price
)  Restaurant's always a Food S_Del_Time and this visit no exception
however, i was able to get in and O_Payment in W_Waiting plus you Food is ready as you go along
S_Menu, and large A_Plc_DiningRoom space
i would P_O_Experience/go_again
a piece of charlotte history
the F_FoodItem is good, maybe not the best
i kinda compare the local que to kyle flethcers in gastonia
this is alright but not quite kyle style
the days of the drive-in or waning
go here for the experience before it's gone
*sigh* F_FoodItem makes me happy! did you know?! it totally does! me and the queens made plans to have Food somewhere - you know
like normal civilized people
all we knew was that i wanted F_FoodItem and that we wanted something awesome! after looking around on yelp i chose to take the queens to cbnc
"so where is this place?""ummm
between 7th street &amp; 10th street off of camel""okaaay? the left or right side of the road?""i unno""what do you mean you don't know? haven't you been here before?!""ummm
no
""oh hell to the no!"*the car then becomes filled with laughter*we passed right by it and then flipped a bitch out of no where and it made us fear for our lives! and then screams filled the car
soon we were parked infront of a soon to be domino's pizza and headed to the Restaurant of my lil yelp dreams
only to be met with a 20 minute S_Del_Time
we were then outside and i was left to fight off the queens who seriously considered going to tokyo express instead! and then finally our names were called and we were A_Fur_Table
our S_Staff was very nice
i want to say that it's the little touches that make cbnc great
the P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh__thick F_FoodItem wedge and fresh sprig of F_Ingredients in the F_Drinks pitchers
the way the S_Staff are so P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
she even complimented on my japanese pronunciation! :) i didn't want to tell her the origin of my great accent
watching kill bill a thousand S_Del_Time
she helped us order F_FoodItem
i wanted nigiri and they didn't have it
i was P_O_Experience/disappointed but still went with her P_O_Experience/suggested P_F_FI_Taste/crispy F_FoodItem and alaskan F_FoodItem
they were amazing! i loved the crunch and the F_Ingredients
with the soy F_Ingredients was scrumptious
we wanted to cancel our orders and just get more F_FoodItem! the alaskan was great as well
i loved it
even the queen who never had F_FoodItem before liked it
after devouring the F_FoodItem our Food came
i ordered the F_FoodItem soba noodle F_Appetizer with F_FoodItem
it came with F_FoodItem instead
(boo!) but the tempura was perfect! (yay!) and i never had soba F_FoodItem, i usually get udon or chinese F_FoodItem
but i really liked the F_Ingredients and the P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem that was wilting more and more as S_Del_Time went on
the slight F_FI_Taste of the sliced green F_FoodItem really made the Food something special
i loved it
i am just so sad that i couldn't finish it all! :(one queen devoured the beef yakisoba F_FoodItem at once! i was able to sneak my S_Cutlery inbetween his F_Appetizer and i got a F_FI_Taste
F_FoodItem was crazy P_F_FI_Taste/yummy! each of the F_FoodItem had a great difinitive flavor and yet melded together amazingly
i loved it
the other queen was pleasantly P_O_Experience/surprised at the F_FI_Taste of his P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem plate
he couldn't finish his eaither but it was really
a lil too spicy for my tastes, but it was still awesome
we then ordered a bottle of wine and a sip here and a sip there and we were all in heaven! talking to our S_Staff about the navajo F_FoodItem S_Staff behind the F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar who she was trying to hook up with one of us
but we couldn't tell who she was trying to hook him up with! one of the queens or me?! said S_Staff never made it to our A_Fur_Table - and it's just as well
we were in Food heaven savoring our delights and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in! i'm a big fan of this Restaurant now and am vowing to take several people with me next time! :)

we live by moto so we are kinda stuck when it comes to F_FoodItem establishments
the F_FoodItem blows
you can tell it isn't P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem and never F_FI_Taste super
the F_Ingredients & F_Drinks are the only good things
i don't really trust a F_FoodItem place that hides the F_FoodItem makers in the A_Plc_Kitchen
stuff probably looks like week old shit which it is
i originally walked in here and thought to myself man i bet this Restaurant is a hot place of old people in the morning
i can see the shamu wearing old ladies gathered here in the morning drinking their F_Drinks and gabbing like little chatting cathy dolls about the new pool boy, and the old dudes talking about their tours in nam and the korea and the few survivors from the big one  ww ii
to say the least i did not see that but i did A_Decor it in my mind
suffice to say it was not like that but that was my first vision:)what's good about this place is it has plenty of A_Places the S_Staff seems very P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive and it is clean and the F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Taste/delicious with pretty P_F_FI_Size/large A_Places
not huge or anything but decent
i did think F_FoodItem was a little P_F_FI_Price/pricey considering i could get a bigger better F_FoodItem at subway for about $3
00 F_FI_Price
this Restaurant in not bad
run of the mill a little pricey
but would not be opposed to going here again
a friend of a friend was telling us about this Restaurant on sunday morning, and how awesome their F_FoodItem is
it sounded awesome, but he warned us the S_Del_OrderingMethod is usually an hour and a half long
oh well, we went anyway
luckily, we were early enough where we didn't have to wait long for a A_Fur_Table
when we were leaving, though, the line was easily an hour long
we started with the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem come in an order of 14 and were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
five of us were dining Restaurant, so we ordered two P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem, with each one being a half, so we had a nice S_Menu of F_FoodItem to try from
we got the F_FoodItem, the frisco, grandma g's, and one more that eludes me now
Food were pretty P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, and i give them mad props for going out of their way to create unique F_FoodItem with untraditional toppings (grandma g's had potato on it)
our entire bill with a few F_Drinks came to under $80
oh, make sure you sit A_OutsideView
the inside had a lot of loud kids, and it seemed to echo off each A_Decor and annoy the hell out of our party
the women in our party also said the A_Env_AC temperature kept changing in there
keep in mind, too, that they don't have a full A_Plc_Bar, so if you're going Restaurant hoping to start off with a bloody mary, you're out of luck
this is about as close to an authentic japanese izakaya as you'll find anywhere
and i'm talking countrywide
i've been to several izakaya in japan over the years and this place just brings me back Restaurant immediately
my japanese buddy in san francisco is jealous of this place to give you a little perspective on my claim
the Food is incredible and you'll find yourself hard pressed to try everything they have to offer as new items come and go all the time
i P_O_Experience/recommend damn near everything on the S_Menu
if something scares you, order it, and you'll be pleasently P_O_Experience/surprised everytime
if you do try Restaurant, make sure you get a members card, as you will definately be returning
for every 5O_Pay_Price you spend you get a stamp
the initial card saves you 5%, fill it up and you save 10%, fill up a second card and you Offers 15%
this is permanent by the way, you can use it for every visit
so go Restaurant already, and i'll most likely see you Restaurant as i am Restaurant 4-5 times a week
oh sweet baby jesus, i love this Restaurant
retro A_Decor, a S_Staff who does a robert deniro impression, and amazing F_FoodItem
about mid way through my (rare) petite filet the other night-i turned to my husband and said, "i want to give this F_FoodItem a baby" because that's how good it is
Restaurant's always a point where i start to get sad that my F_FoodItem will be gone shortly, so i try to slow down
but it's too hard at the golden steer! i don't want to slow down! nomnomnom
forget the stupid fancy places in the hotels on the strip, the Restaurant is the real deal
go
now
i'm no korean/hawaiian Food expert, but Restaurant has lived up to the hype
thanks jade for the recommendation
myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't P_O_Experience/impressed
first off, the F_FoodItem is bomb here
i can usually leave out the F_FoodItem, but that's only because so many places in vegas have mediocre kimchi
not this F_FoodItem
you'll get this as an F_Appetizer, so even if you are not a kimchi person you have to try it
our S_Staff (the S_Staff?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the F_FoodItem, being the F_FoodItem fanatic that he is, and complimented us some F_FoodItem  off the hook
the crust was kind of F_FI_Quality, but not greasy at all
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, great spice and herb F_FI_Taste
a good sign of things to come
i ordered the hot rock bi bim bap
friggin P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
quality F_FoodItem, super P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem, and S_Stf_Behavior kochujang(?) F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly F_FI_Taste
what set this Food apart for me was the high F_FI_Quality for just around $10
00
oh, and don't forget the crystallized F_FoodItem grains at the bottom
despite gorging myself on refills of F_FoodItem, i couldn't stop eating the bi bim bap until every last F_FoodItem grain was gone
just a great version of this classic korean Food!i also managed to F_FI_Taste my friend's bulgolgi
i normally don't like F_FoodItem because it is always tough and overly F_Ingredients
not this F_FoodItem, which is the best i have ever had
very F_FI_CookingLevel, and expertly seasoned
the F_Ingredients was A_Decor and of a homemade F_FI_Quality
just delicious!again, special thanks to jade and the other yelpers
i don't know why it has taken me so long to try island style
if you don't know if you like korean Food, this is the place to try it
if you don't always feel like korean Food, this is the place to go when you do
if you are a korean Food snob, give Restaurant a try and let me know what you think!

so sad! this used to be one of my fave places
over the last 10 years i've barely ever make my trip Restaurant anymore because i am steadily P_O_Experience/disappointed in the F_FI_Quality if Food! F_FoodItem is spoiled or scarce, spring F_FoodItem filling probably a week P_F_FI_Quality/old
so sad because they literally have the best pad thai and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem on a good day
today i was craving F_FoodItem thread noodle so i thought i would given them a chance again
, once again skimped on F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Quality/old and yellow (how can you not make P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem everyday?) , and they seem to think spicy means throwing in a shit load of crushed red F_FoodItem which adds no F_FI_Taste or spice just stomache irritation,
i'm so sad to say, after over 10 years this my last straw
sad because Restaurant's so much potential if they took the S_Del_Time to deliver the F_FI_Quality
easily the best Restaurant in madison
let me start by saying this place is really hard to find! even with my trusty gps i found myself walking in circles and calling, calling,calling
i've seen many complaints about Service on here, and while my Service was not bad in terms of inattentiveness, it certainly wasn't normal
the S_Staff and S_Staff both came over several S_Del_Time while we were eating and at one point i just wanted to say, "um, can we eat? please? it's great
i assure you
skidaddle
"we had the wildberry pancakes with a side of F_FoodItem
everything was good but for what we got, i consider the W_Price steep
$12
50 for 2 pancakes?? yes, they were good, but why not 3 with a little more topping? my $4 side of F_FoodItem was 3 F_FoodItem F_FI_Size and maybe 1/4 cup of F_FoodItem
lame
it's good but i'm not sure if i would return, at least on a day when i was really hungry
i've gone here twice in the 3 days since i moved to tempe and am extremely grateful to have found this gem (thanks yelp!)
i eat between 5-10 F_FoodItem a week and have no doubt that i will be getting several of those from dilly's
the first S_Del_Time i S_Delivery a F_FoodItem, i was a bit put off by the thickness of the F_FoodItem;  i did not want the F_FoodItem to overwhelm or disguise the F_FI_Taste of the F_FoodItem/cheeses/F_Ingredients
however, the F_FoodItem (foccacia) was actually quite soft and complemented the F_FoodItem (the smokey mountain) quite well
nonetheless, i would warn that if you really are opposed to eating a relatively F_FI_Size amount of F_FoodItem with your F_FoodItem, you might prefer something else, or perhaps one of the wraps offered here (though i haven't tried any of those yet)
also, it'd be nice if nutritional information were made available on the website
one of the hibernate reasons that 80% of my F_FoodItem consumption has been at subway/cosi/potbelly is that i know the F_FI_Healthy content of what i'm eating
i hope to come here as many times as possible before the asu onslaught begins in a few weeks
i hope the lines aren't out the door when classes start
although i suppose i will just eat Food at 2 if that's the case
with all that hype about this Restaurant, i was excited about going Restaurant
but hmm it was just
how can i put it? meh! didn't do it for me
i would rather go to daphne's
when it comes to W_Price Food on the westside of town, nothing beats thai F_FoodItem on jones
many a time have coworkers and i stopped in for a great Food on the P_F_FI_Price/cheap
have tried it a few S_Del_Time outside of Food which just means the portions are a little F_FI_Size and W_Price higher but still great thai Food
oh
and the Service is awesome! the only thing i have against this place is their F_Drinks F_FI_Taste weird to me, but things like F_FI_CookingLevel F_Drinks or F_Ingredients in my sprite are all good
odd
maybe it is just me
this place was horrible! i O_Payment 200 dollars for dinner for two, my F_FoodItem was still mooing! if you are in vegas and want a real F_FoodItem, gordon ramsey steakhouse does it right!

thank you yolinda for always making me and my guest O_Experience to your Restaurant
it's always nice to come to this fabulous Restaurant for business meeting with my clients
the Food and Service is always excellent, and of course, my guest was amazed by the selection of F_FoodItem you always have to offer
keep up the good work and always keep the O_Exp_StarsByCus!!

yummy!  we stumbled upon this after attending an event in vegas and just needed to find a place to eat
i usually am so picky about F_FoodItem that i won't go to just any place but we needed to eat
the F_FoodItem was very good
the F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
so much so we bought a bottle of the dressing to take home with us
okay, so this was a total hole in the A_Decor, but great carne asada F_FoodItem
i would  perhaps have given them O_Exp_StarsByCus if the 3 F_FoodItem F_FoodItem had actually first included the gacmole they were suppose to and the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/melted
but the carne asada was very good, almost san diego-like
the place put the Food together in a heart beat but it was 10:30pm
i have to say, Restaurant is in the memory banks
so close to the airport and the strip (if you have a car)
just do this, S_Delivery a carne asada F_FoodItem and ask for extra gac and if you S_Delivery the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem do the 5 with the works
glad i found this on yelp and for sure O_Exp_StarsByCus
oh and this is take-out only, no A_Fur_Table really and not a place you want to hang
normally love baja, but this one has been very P_O_Experience/disappointing
F_FoodItem, F_FI_Taste like rubber
all but one F_FoodItem was worth eating
F_FoodItem are a no go, and F_FoodItem was average
my suggestion, don't let this be your first experience a baja F_FI_Quality, go to another location, they do have good Food!

i have eaten at this Restaurant twice
the first Food was memorable and i never forgot it
as a result, i was so excited to P_O_Experience/go_back last week
i had the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem for an F_Appetizer which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of Restaurant
my friend had a F_FoodItem F_Appetizer that was the favorite of the S_Staff's but we both found it very strange
it was supposed to be something creole and the F_FoodItem was covered with an unattractive brown F_Ingredients
odd
we both had a filet mignon
i S_Delivery mine F_FI_Size rare
i couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare
disgusting
it was fine but not F_FI_Price $50
it came with a  F_Ingredients that made it delicious though
without the F_Ingredients it would have been a big P_O_Experience/disappointment
we S_Delivery a side of F_FI_CookingLevel F_Ingredients
that was the best part of the Food
we each S_Delivery a F_Dessert
i had the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem it was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which i love) but with little cream
it was fine
my friend had the creme brulee and F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
Service was very nice
overall at $312 i won't be going back simply because it isn't W_Price the money
best A_Plc_Bar in the venetian! i am in vegas for a conference
after realizing the line at lavo would take at least an hour (per the bouncer) despite the fact that our group had rented out the A_Places, i checked yelp and found the vip S_Staff (jorge) personal number
after a few extremely helpful texts assuring us no cover, a bunch of us headed over Restaurant, tweeting that we were going and for the rest of our group to follow
michelle at the door was S_Stf_Behavior and let us right in
all toll about 50 of us ended up Restaurant and had a great night! the F_Drinks are extremely reasonable for this casino ($8 for a rum and coke, $8 for wine, etc) and Restaurant is hookah for a respectable $25
the dj was great and had us all dancing
i was blown away by how much the S_Staff went out of their way for our group and truly saved our night!

not much to say about this place
the ambience is hip and the Service is good but unfortunately, the Food is pedestrian and while there's a lot of fancy mexican F_Ingredients verbage on the S_Menu, it's still pretty straight forward typical americanized-mexican fare
F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, tamales, combo plates etc
i can get this kind of Food in my suburban home town that F_FI_Taste better and costs a lot less
even the highly-rated A_Fur_Table-side F_FoodItem was just ok
Restaurant's just too much stuff A_Environment
could all of this be smoothed over by a nice F_Drinks?  well, i will never know because mine was too sweet
overall, a P_O_Experience/disappointment
i've been to the house of blues for a few concerts now, and there are plenty of other venues that offer a better sound F_FI_Quality, especially in las vegas
if you have the opportunity to see a band at another venue, i highly P_O_Experience/recommend it
the sound F_FI_Quality is awful, so Restaurant will be a very low chance you'll understand anything coming out of the singers mouth
it ends up being just a muffle that fades into the rest of the band
the ambience is great and just shy of being too hip
S_Staff was super friendly--felt like i was eating at a friend's house, but guess that's the point
limoncello and Food F_Dessert were great
our S_Staff suggested we get the chocolate one over F_Ingredients cream
you should try it
didn't try the F_FoodItem
we'll P_O_Experience/be_back
Restaurant has definitely improved
i remember the early days of soggy crusts, P_F_FI_Price/cheap F_FoodItem, subpar F_Ingredients and F_FI_CookingLevel  this is certainly no longer the case
the place was super jammed around 6pm on a S_OpenHours S_OpenHours
it was actually kind of exciting!  all the S_Staff in back were having a good ol' S_Del_Time, and the gals up front taking the S_Delivery were visibly stressed, but doing a great job
we ended up creating our own vegetarian F_FoodItem
we kept it simple, and just added F_FoodItem & F_FoodItem
it's everyone's new favorite
in fact, i've been S_Delivery the same combination at other F_FoodItem places, but F_FoodItem not nearly as P_F_FI_Taste/yummy as mamma mia's version
they have a great selection to build your own, however i'm sure that all their offerings are a hit as evidenced by the long line of hungry F_FoodItem lovers going out the door
i've been to F_FoodItem at other casinos, but this is the best by far! lots of fresh seafood, great carving stations, however i was not a fan of the way the prime rib was seasoned, and great F_Dessert!

at first i was P_O_Experience/disappointed with padre's S_Menu
i usually get F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem, and they only had soft F_FoodItem
but then i ventured out and got this amazing F_FoodItem F_FoodItem that came with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
really glad i tried it
i was also pleased to see that they had sol F_Drinks on the S_Menu
it is my favorite mexican cerveza, and i usually can't find it in Restaurant
great Food! best F_FoodItem F_FoodItem i've ever had
get the nachos, you won't be P_O_Experience/disappointed! 10x better than roberto's!

awesome Offers! their microbrewed F_Drinks are a mere $2 a pint from 3-6pm monday through friday (excluding holidays and monS_OpenHours night football
) they also have $2 well F_Drinks and F_Drinks as well as a great selection of A_Plc_Bar Food for $4
50
i had an ipa and a santa klaas holiday ale which was specially brewed for the holiday season
this was a very dark ale that is made with F_Drinks F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients nibs
it was a delicious and different F_FI_Taste ale with F_Drinks and chocolate overtones
the Service was friendly and fantastic!we were only Restaurant for F_Drinks this trip but will definitely return for more awesome F_Drinks and to try some of the P_F_FI_Taste/yummy Food!

think new jersey Food size S_Menu, lots and lots of choices covering most major Food groupings
i had an lto special called F_FoodItem which had a pleasant F_FI_Quality red F_Ingredients and was served over potato cakes
very generous F_FI_Size and i P_O_Experience/enjoyed it
we also tried the rib's which turned out to be very decent considering it is a chain Restaurant with a broad S_Menu
Service was very good and the store had a good sized A_OutsideView eating area
would certainly go again if in the area
you know how sometimes a place has such an impact on you that you start writing a review in your head as soon as you put something in your mouth? that happened and zero stars should be a thing
i decided to give this Food a chance since a client had booked rooms for my coworker and i at excalibur, and after getting up 6am for the flight and working until 7S_OpenHours that day, we were both exhausted and didn't want to go very far for Food
big mistake
no matter how tired or hungry you think you are, you are not desperate enough to eat here
i would have preferred walking back to la
the selection was awful, all the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Quality/dry, the seaFood looked sketchy enough that i was too scared of potential Food poisoning to try anything, and a lot of items at the F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar were browning
all i ended up eating was a couple F_Appetizer of F_FoodItem, one F_Appetizer of potato gratin, and F_FoodItem
yes, F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Price/cheap (only $22) but it's not even W_Price that
i wish i'd just gone hungry
went Restaurant for Food today
the place is next to hot n juicy
not big, but not too crowded at Food S_Del_Time
the S_Menu is very simple just S_Menu
i had the F_FoodItem soon F_FoodItem, my friend had dolsot bibimbap special
both of us P_O_Experience/enjoyed our Food
the F_FoodItem is tender and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, the F_FoodItem inside is also F_FI_CookingLevel
the Service is very fast too
we went at around 5:30 on a  tuesday S_OpenHours and the Restaurant was fairly P_A_Env_Type/busy
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, and the highlight of the Food
the only other two Food Food were P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm enough were the walnut F_FoodItem and the F_FI_CookingLevel clams
Restaurant were a lot of high value items at the Food, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and the like, but most of it was F_FI_Quality and not as tasty as it looked
Restaurant was a wide selection ans some interesting S_Menu, like clams smothered in cheddar F_FoodItem
i guess this is arizona, and i should not have been P_O_Experience/surprised that next to the sweet and sour F_Ingredients Restaurant was a tub of F_FoodItem
Restaurant was also obligatory chinese Food F_FoodItem
i don't eat any of these picky eater accommodation Food, so cannot comment on their F_FI_Taste
they had a S_Menu of F_Dessert, too, including a F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar
i had the green F_Drinks F_Dessert and it was okay, Restaurant were a couple of F_Ingredients crystals in it
the place was W_Price than i thought it would be
i think the W_Price range should be adjusted to W_Price $$
i did not try the F_FoodItem, but Restaurant was a S_Staff preparing it as we watched and it looked good
awesome Food, A_Places are a lot better than most places, W_Price are good too
well definitely be stopping in when in that area
P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff

i've been here twice now for the Food Food and the second S_Del_Time i even brought a friend who was a foodie and both S_Del_Time it was great
they have a great selection of dips on the Food, a few F_FoodItem and many P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm Food to choose from
i P_O_Experience/recommend taking a little bit of everything and if you follow my rule, you won't be P_O_Experience/disappointed
Food is absolutely P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and you'll have fun guessing the spices in the various Food
if you're in the mood for some tasty middle eastern Food, i would really P_O_Experience/recommend it
it's a little short on Ambience, but with F_FI_Taste like that, who's looking anywhere but their plate?

went to flo's tonight, we ordered hot and sour F_Appetizer, which was very sour & not Food at all; crunchy tofu with F_FoodItem, which was ok, one of the highlights of the Food; F_FI_Religious chow mein, F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/tasteless; F_FI_Religious F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem was ok, nothing special; and moo shu F_FoodItem, which wasn't good
the majority of the Food was P_F_FI_Taste/tasteless
Restaurant were 5 of us in total, and we O_Payment $50 plus tip
gag worthy Food and Service; sketchy business practices!  this place deserves 0 stars
i was in las vegas on a business trip and S_Delivery a slice of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
it was dripping with so much grease that even 5 napkins would not sop it up
i returned the entire slice F_FI_Quality and requested my W_Price the S_Staff at the register refused and told me to come back at night and ask for pete
i returned later and the S_Staff "S_Staff" told me pete wasn't Restaurant and they don't give W_Price  after ignoring me for 10 minutes she realized i wasn't going away so she called pete on the phone
he said he would have to mail me a check  for the purchase W_Price of the slice
uh, the slice was $3 and, as you probably guessed, i never received the check
in addition to the gross Food, i made the mistake of entering the A_Plc_RestRoom and the stench of urine and fllth almost knocked me unconscious! avoid this place under all circumstances!!

excellent Food! i was here for a Food meeting and was Service but i believe for the 3 of us the bill came out to $40 if you're trying to estimate W_Price note we were here on a monday and they close at 4:00 pm on monday's
Restaurant was ample A_Fur_Table inside, but i can see it hard to grab a A_Fur_Table during the Food rush
they have your standard mexican Food
i was craving some F_FoodItem so i S_Delivery the al pastor F_FoodItem combo with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
i was hardly able to finish but it was too good to leave Food the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/yummy too
interestingly enough they were lacking hot F_Ingredients options and brought out a small condiment cup of tapatio when i asked for some
everyone else seemed to tear up their Food as well and seemed P_O_Experience/satisfied
reason for the O_Exp_StarsByCus then? it's not the best F_FoodItem i've had, so i have to save the 5 stars for my favorite places, but for a lot of people this is a 5 star place
this place is awesome! i never have been a fan of chinese Restaurant, other than panda express, but this place is great
i'd P_O_Experience/recommend the sweet n sour F_FoodItem :) and the best part is, they S_Delivery!

i noticed a bunch of pho places on spring during my trip to vegas this past weekend
having partied hardy the night before, our group decided pho was definitely in order
maybe i'm spoiled a bit because i've had the best pho in san jose and westminster
and so my pho standards are pretty high
i felt it was an okay place at first glance: clean, lots of vietnamese locals, and spacious
the pho was really average
the Food lacked body and substance, and could have possibly been adulterated with some swanson's F_FoodItem broth
i hate that
the noodles were okay, but the F_FoodItem was totally skimpy in the F_FI_Size
Restaurant are F_FoodItem in pho dac biet, i got no such F_FoodItem in my bowl and no tripe either =(i also S_Delivery some vietnamese F_Ingredients F_Drinks (Restaurant sua da) and it wasn't strong enough
Restaurant skimped on the F_Drinks grounds
i like places that prepare the french press in front of you instead of going to the back and giving you pre-stirred F_Drinks, but they shafted me on the strength
it F_FI_Taste F_Drinks down
i'd probably never come back unless it were like the am and i was desperately wasted
the Service kind of sucked too
we were all hungover and needed F_Drinks
we had to ask 100x S_Del_Time for refills!this place kind of reminds of the F_FI_Quality and even appearance of lee's noodle house in san jose off of tully rd
if you're from san jose, you know what i'm talking about - this is lee's noodle house twin brother in vegas
second Food stop in my 5 day stay
the highlight of the Restaurant had to be the fire alarm that rang out in the middle of our Food
heh, dunno what happened Restaurant
all that aside, the Food itself was below average to average
probably the only thing i liked was the har gow
the F_Dessert was loathful; leaving it out in the open for what seemed like for hours (the colours look way off)
i didn't bother touching it, as who knows what kind of F_FI_Healthy has grown in those things
one of my favorite tempe spots, forefathers really instilled in me a love for the philly F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
when visiting, i always S_Delivery the 2nd F_FoodItem option with white american F_FoodItem, and either a side of F_FoodItem or their equally excellent F_Appetizer
for those wanting to manage their A_Places, their F_FoodItem also come in smaller sizes
after placing your S_Delivery, be sure to go to the small A_Furniture across from the F_Drinks machine and get a side of their sweet F_FoodItem to accompany your F_FoodItem
this place has great Food, and along with it a comfortable, casual dining A_Environment
it also has P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff and S_Staff
it's been a while since i lived in phoenix, but whenever i return and come to forefathers, Restaurant are people working here who remember me and O_Experience me back
if you check out forefathers, i am sure you'll want to P_O_Experience/come_back again
interesting reading other reviews complaining about the P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude S_Staff too
it is the hibernate reason i will never put my foot in cafepino again, apart from the fact that Food is P_F_FI_Price/overpriced
i much prefer to go to amc F_Dessert ridge and have F_Drinks and F_Appetizer half W_Price during Offers at the yard house, where the S_Staff is O_Experience and cares about his customers
eight of us went to movies and had Food at cafepino last month
the Food was okay but i had to cancel F_Dessert because it took so long to arrive and our movie was starting in a few minutes
we were Restaurant long before the movie started to have enough S_Del_Time to eat
when we wanted to O_Payment separately because everyone didn't have cash, the S_Staff scoffed at us and basically said he couldn't accommodate us, only one person had to O_Payment
we were all shocked at how P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude S_Staff was and decided to move our once-a-month movie night to a different location
good job in loosing eight customers in one fell swoop
bon chance!

ever since i came here the first time i went to vegas, i've been dying to P_O_Experience/come_back
the Food is so good!  i thought we just got lucky the first time we came, but as it turns out, everything we've tried on the S_Menu thus far is delicious
Ambience is classy and cool
it's a nice location within the palazzo hotel with lots of A_Fur_Table
Service was also good, as my F_Drinks glass was always full despite being very busy on a friday night at midnight
we got:moqueca mista - F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_Drinks, F_FoodItem, dende oil, chimichurri F_FoodItem - $29 - http://www
yelp
com/biz_photos/sushisamba-las-vegas?select=t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4ua#t4jwaobhrbkbp4vr92x4uathis thing is the best ever
creamy Food curry F_FI_Taste (hence F_Drinks) with the delicate seafood mixed in with bits of crushed cashews, giving the Food great texture
F_FoodItem was served within the F_Ingredients mixture as shown; the F_FoodItem F_FI_CookingLevel up all the F_Ingredients, making every F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Taste/divine
i thought after a while the Food would get too rich-tasting, but somehow i kept gobbling and gobbling until the plate was empty!el topo F_FoodItem F_FoodItem - salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, P_F_FI_Taste/crispy F_FoodItem - $15 (forgot to take a pic; too excited about the moqueca mista)very unique F_FoodItem with interesting F_FI_Taste and textures = P_F_FI_Taste/delicious!F_FoodItem teriyaki - samba style organic F_FoodItem, aji amarillo, purple potato mash, P_F_FI_Taste/crispy F_FoodItem - $26 (again forgot to take a pic
)when i saw the huge W_Price tag i thought "wtf?!", especially for a seemingly simple plate as F_FoodItem teriyaki (my friend S_Delivery this one so i had no control)
buttt i'll have to say that it was probably the best teriyaki F_FoodItem i've ever had in my life!  super juicy fillets of teriyaki F_FoodItem, pan F_FI_CookingLevel (i think) to a F_FI_CookingLevel  the F_Ingredients was perfect; not too saucy, not too dry, and definitely not overpowering to the Food
as with all finer dining Restaurant, especially on the las vegas strip, i did think the W_Price were a little inflated
hence the lack of that final star
however, probably one of my favorite places to eat while in vegas
i'll definitely hit it up again on future trips
they have a good Offers too (both early evening and S_OpenHours), so i'll have to take advantage of that next S_Del_Time! :)

just tried create S_OpenHours on a date with the hubby
great place to build your own F_FoodItem and custard sundaes!  too many choices for me, so i opted for the pre-designed option:  the abstract F_FoodItem F_FI_Religious) made Food (provolone, pineapple, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, terriyaki F_Ingredients) on a hawaiian F_FoodItem with sweet F_Appetizer
yum!  next S_Del_Time i'd like to try the F_FoodItem
and opt for a wheat F_FoodItem and maybe get a little more creative with toppings, but the combinations are endless
the options for the custard is just as abundant!  candy, nuts, F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients
and of course the pre-set combos
i tried the berriesoho sundae in a coneF_FoodItem, blueF_Ingredients, blackberries, whipped F_FoodItem, and F_Ingredients F_Dessert
i think it was the first S_Del_Time someone asked for a sundae in a F_Dessert, but it worked
the only problem was that it was melting faster than i could eat it, but still very yum!great place for ppl who like choices and want to be Food
the people who work Restaurant are very friendly and the place is A_Places
it's a little too pricey for me to be a "F_FI_Size" place to eat, but i will definitely P_O_Experience/go_back again
i cannot explain how much i love the Food here, especially the fungi F_FoodItem
to
die
for
they have a great Offers S_Menu from 3-6 and all day sunday, which i appreciate
the Service is hit and miss
if only they could be more consistent with the Service, this place would knock it out of the A_Places
S_Stf_Experience and S_Stf_Behavior Service, at one point the S_Staff didn't stop by for 20 minutes
the Food took over 45 minutes and was cold when it was served
$300 Food for 4 people, better to spend your money elsewhere
only good point was the key F_FoodItem
my partner and i went to eddie's house prior to her A_Decor show opening at a nearby gallery
we planned on eddie's as a start to a very special evening
we were A_Fur_Table on the A_Plc_Patio and it took our S_Staff 7 minutes to S_Stf_Behavior us and ask us if we would like F_Drinks
we S_Delivery F_Drinks and waited another 10 minutes for them to arrive
when he brought them he made no mention of the long wait
we S_Delivery an F_Appetizer to share and then a P_F_FI_Size/large F_FoodItem platter to share as our Food
he brought everything out at once which was not what we asked for
we ate our dinner and asked for the bill upon completion as we were leaving to get to the A_Decor show
we S_Del_Time and waited
and waited
i went inside to try to find him with no luck
20 minutes later he brought the bill out
the Food was average and over W_Price
we were charged for a P_F_FI_Size/small Food of extra pita F_FoodItem to supplement the original small serving that arrived with the hummus
all in all it was a P_O_Experience/disappointing experience due primarily to the dismissive behavior by our S_Staff
i called eddie's house the next day to share my feedback and got eddie on the phone
i started telling him about my experience and he he S_Stf_Behavior like i was interrupting him
he asked if he could call me right back and confirmed my phone number with me
he never called back
i will never return to eddie's house after this poor example of Service
Restaurant are too many other F_FI_Quality Restaurant in scottsdale to dine in who Service customers like they are W_Price the effort to be courteous
went with A_Env_Type and thought Food F_FI_Taste a bit like Restaurant Food
overall, my A_Env_Type loved it
i was just not too "krazy" about it
to be hnonest, i have only eaten here a few S_Del_Time, but i always use them for F_FI_CookingLevel
today was no different
perfect in every way
thank you mitch(S_Staff) for all of your hard work
great Service, thank you!

what a great A_Environment find! i live just around the corner and was so exited to find a new F_FI_Size place to go out to eat! the place has a great A_Environment with an old chevy right in the center
the S_Staff could not be any more P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly either! when it comes to the Food, you can't go wrong! the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem is to die for, and i can't wait to come for Food to try the F_FoodItem granola pancakes
i give it an a++!

the quick and dirty - on a great A_LocatedAreaA_Environment: Restaurant vasco da gama (henceforth referred to as cvdg) has been around for a while
a Restaurant that serves Food, it's offend crowded with couples and busy working professionals - its a great place to see and be seen and ironically one can even hide away here! (go to the back!)Food: tunal F_FoodItem?! yes please - a specialty of the place, cvdg surges paninis, F_Appetizer, F_Dessert and F_Drinks that are both temptingly good and filling
never had a bad Food here
Service: since the Restaurant can be quite P_A_Env_Type/crowded, be prepared to wait a little bit to be seated
choices are made in person at the counter, and Food is delivered to you once its ready
minimal Service, but always pleasant and courteous
pop in for a bit during the work day but my favourite S_Del_Time to visit is during the early hours of sat / sun - people are a lot more relaxed and Restaurant's a general sense of easy about the place as people are inclined to be a lot more mellow
summer times even bring a few A_OutsideView A_Fur_Table for some open A_Env_AC render-vousyou should go :)

Restaurant is horrible, i wouldn't feed this to my dog
it is however tasty and greasy if you haven't a  palate
this is such a cozy place! i had no idea it was right around the corner for me
4 weeks into going vegan and i was starting to feel like my only option at any Restaurant or Restaurant was F_Ingredients topped with F_FoodItem
not so at sunrise F_Drinks! i'm finding lots of other places offer items as well, but S_Menu need to be asked for
the F_Drinks was delicious, and just as beautiful to boot! the Food was great
i had the alien F_FoodItem, and my boyfriend had the nomnom F_FoodItem
both made vegan
no complaints from either of us! W_Price are fair
the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Appearance/adorable and P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly! support local, and keep this place alive!!

mmmm i love buffalo F_FI_CookingLevel! if ever i am feeling in a serious need for some F_FoodItem, this is always my first and last port of call as it always does the trick
situated just around the corner from the hibernate university campus, george square, buffalo grill is a great place for students to go for Food or Food
i completely and utterly adore buffalo grill's F_FoodItem
the S_Staff always ask you how well you want your F_FoodItem F_FI_CookingLevel, as it always comes out exactly how you have asked it to be done
i tend to S_Delivery their diablo F_FoodItem, which comes with sour cream, F_FoodItem and jalapenos F_FoodItem so F_FoodItem is pretty P_F_FI_Taste/spicy but amazing
the F_FoodItem come in two different sizes, and i always S_Delivery the smaller version as that fills me up and costs about £5 and the bigger size costs about £7
the F_FoodItem come with fries, F_FoodItem and, my favourite, F_FoodItem! buffalo grill also serves a huge variety of different scottish F_FoodItem which cost no more than £10 - what a bargain! but the buffalo grill is not just a place for F_FoodItem eaters, as they have a hibernate S_Menu which offers a good selection of F_FI_Religious Food too such as F_FoodItem's and F_FoodItem benedict
a variety of F_Dessert are also available including F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem pie which is amazing
buffalo grill also allow you to bring your own booze which is a much F_FI_Price option than buying F_Drinks in a Restaurant
i completely adore this place and cannot P_O_Experience/recommend it more highly - go!!

F_FoodItem in the uk has been grievously P_O_Experience/disappointing, both in W_Price and representation
gone are the days when $4 can score me a half-pounder cabaza/lengua F_FoodItem
tex mex was the last i expected this far up north
scotland rocks
let's do this bullet-point styleF_Drinks - decent tequila content and thoroughly slushed
nothing more annoying that semi-icy concoctions that don't travel up straws well
much respect for carrying dos equis, corona, sol, modelo and that obscure little label pacifico
tequila - they carry the good stuff; these S_Staff have done their homework
gun for the anejos
don julio gold anejo was my pick
floutas - more like giant taquitos, the corn tostada-wrapped F_FoodItem is deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried to crunchy perfection
F_FI_CookingLevel off with F_FoodItem, sour cream and guac it's what i'd expect to see in higher-end mexican Restaurant in la or san diego
carnitas - the F_FoodItem was served in cubes and was much too P_F_FI_Healthy/salty, unfortunately
F_FoodItem - covered in a healthy layer of F_FoodItem to be called such, it's an accurate enough representation of what my mexican friends' moms would make at home
approved
i really wish that i lived closer to one of the crackers A_LocatedArea, because their Food S_Menu rocks! after a field trip to ikea with my mom and sister we decided to grab a F_Appetizer to eat, i knew that crackers had recently opened nearby, so we stopped by
the inside is very cute, feels like you are in someones country home
the S_Menu has a huge variety of Food Food, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and F_Appetizer
on weekends, they serve Food all day! i got the carnitas Food skillet, and let me just say, they seriously have some of the best carnitas in town, no joke! the F_FoodItem was so F_FI_CookingLevel; covered with jack F_FoodItem on a bed of potatoes, heaven! my sister got the blt, and they were not skimpy on the F_Ingredients! i have had some of their soups before, and let's just say, the cream of F_FoodItem & artichoke is like heaven in a bowl! so rich, and F_FI_Taste, it is like eating dip without the F_FoodItem! they are only open until 2:00, but it is great spot to grab a F_Appetizer to eat for Food or Food!

one of the better Food places on this side of town, good selection, nice S_Staff, not too busy

i do enjoy the Food here
finding good island Food like how you would get in hawaii is state find in las vegas
my favorites are the kalbi, F_FoodItem and the weekly specials
my wife insists we come every tuesday for the fries noodles
all Food are ample portions
most like you will have Food for the A_Furniture tomorrow
the chantilly vale is to for
the live A_Ent_Music on the selected weekend is a treat
Service here is always on point
keep up the great work it's like you on an island in the middle of the F_Dessert
eh, but better airport Food then usual

if i had to eat one Food every day this would be the one i would pick
the long lines are a minus,but that shows others  [mostly locals] also feel as i do
Service was slow and the Food was horrible!!!! with 4 exclamation points
we went through the drive-thru and the handwritten sign says pull forward to S_Delivery, so we did
the S_Staff didn't come to the A_Furniture for 7 minutes
then he asks us to wait another couple of minutes to take our S_Delivery
at that point we should have left
but i was curious as to see what the rave was all about on the travel channel
when we finally get our S_Delivery taken
we S_Delivery a pastrami F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem fries
not only was the wait to S_Delivery long the S_Del_Time to get our Food was even longer
total S_Del_Time 25 minutes, no i'm not joking
as any fast Food eating american would do we pulled out the F_FoodItem fries and took a few out while we were driving away
yes they were hot as expected
but F_FoodItem were so P_F_FI_Healthy/salty and hardly any F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste
we were expecting minced F_FoodItem and to our surprise it was only F_FoodItem salt with more salt - yuck
the F_FoodItem was very thinly sliced but was very P_F_FI_Healthy/fatty
not typical of "la style pastrami" as advertised
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was hard and not P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
could it get any worse - yes, the pickle was not put in a separate wrapper as i asked, so the pickle F_Drinks made the inside F_FoodItem soggy
i do not like pickles on my F_FoodItem
the portion of pastrami was very skimpy
imo - this place is not Worthiness of any publicity on national A_Ent_Tv
Food is P_F_FI_Price/expensive and the Food is crap
if you are in los angeles got to the hat, you will not be P_O_Experience/disappointed!

if you go to happys , you become part of the happy's A_Env_Type! great S_Menu, simple good Food with generous portions! we love leo, donna and the entire crew
try it you will love it!

pros: great F_FoodItem, especially for ayce!!  whoever posted that their F_FoodItem are mostly F_FoodItem, are completely wrong!  in comparison to other ayce F_FoodItem places, they have very P_F_FI_Size/little F_FoodItem
great P_F_FI_Size/big portions of F_FoodItem, etc
maybe at one point they did mostly F_FoodItem, but not since nov 2011
nice S_Staff
Food ayce was approx
$20/person cons: it was super super hot A_Environment
i had to go outside a couple S_Del_Time to cool down
they must have had the A_Furniture cranked up
finally told them about the A_Env_AC temp and they were kind and turned it down (still a little hot)
also, the F_FoodItem were taking forever to come out
that was the longest wait for F_FoodItem i had to wait for
they were good and fancy (seemed to be made w/extra love), but if you are in a hurry, i would sit at the A_Plc_Bar!  not a very P_A_Env_Size/large Restaurant
not really good for big groups
ok Ambience-nothing fancy
overall, good place and would P_O_Experience/recommend it and would P_O_Experience/go_back
prob sit at the A_Plc_Bar! :p

thank goodness for good company! though the Service was great
the rest was
not so much
first strike: the filthiest wine glass i have ever seen
and i normally don't O_Payment attention to such things
good thing i did!! secondly, the F_Ingredients F_FI_CookingLevel was quite odd
not what im used to, and very 'mayonaise-y' (creamy)
and while the F_FoodItem were quite good, nothing stood out as P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic about Food
the tempura flakes on one of our F_FoodItem were definitely stale
(unless chewy tempura flakes are the new thing
?) next time i'm in the queen city, i will skip room 112
sorry (as for the filthy wine A_Furniture it was replaced even after the F_Drinks was poured in
the bottle was replaced as well)
the Food is just amazing! a F_FoodItem is about $6 then you O_Payment around $1 for whatever you want to add to the F_FoodItem (F_Ingredients, pickle
$3 for fries and you have an option of F_FI_Size fries, sweet potatoes or F_FoodItem! (i P_O_Experience/recommend the mixed one)
$6 for poutines! (which are really good!)F_Drinks are $2-$3
i usually take a F_Drinks and for $1 more, i get a F_FI_Size of vanilla icecream added to it! (just amazing)!

i have been to this place for 3 times now
their Service sucks
F_FI_Quality of Food is worst
i had F_Ingredients F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem last S_Del_Time and i had Food F_FI_Healthy and i threw up on my way back to work
i am not P_O_Experience/going_back again

great hidden gem in old town scottsdale!  we had an amazon deal to use and decided to stop in for Food with our furry friend this weekend
the S_Staff was so nice and P_S_Stf_Behavior/welcoming to us and our dog on the A_Plc_Patio
we tried a pretzel with mustard, F_Ingredients with noodles and F_FoodItem, the F_FoodItem and mozzarella F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and a homemade prickly pear cream F_Drinks
Food was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and a perfect Food!  highly P_O_Experience/recommend!

cherries has the potential to be a decent Food in market square, but they don't quite deliver
i stopped here for a late Food and grabbed a A_Furniture at the counter
the place was packed, which isn't saying much when the max capacity is like 30
anyway, it took awhile to order, even just to get a cup of F_Drinks
it seemed like they had enough S_Staff, but what they were all doing, i'm not sure
so i finally got my over-easy F_FoodItem (F_FoodItem already broken), F_Ingredients (crunch, crunch) and potatoes (eh)
oh, the F_FI_CookingLevel was good
i was so hungry, i didn't even care at that point
so, i finished the Food and waited, waited, S_Delivery for my check
thankfully, Food was fairly P_F_FI_Price/inexpensive
i was happy to O_Payment and leave quickly to find a real cup of F_Drinks somewhere else
one star for the atmosphere besides that the Food was really bad i got the F_FoodItem sliders and they were just plain gross
the F_FoodItem was nasty and F_FI_Taste like F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried in F_FI_Quality F_Ingredients
harsh i know
very good mexican F_FI_Taste F_Drinks, the W_Price are a little on the high side but W_Price it when you get fresh F_Ingredients in all the Food!

i've been to mundo twice now, and highly P_O_Experience/recommend it
Food is a bit P_F_FI_Price/pricey, but well W_Price it
the Service this S_Del_Time was not great, but the Food was P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic
i had the sea bass, which was amazing
Food came with F_FoodItem and was quite P_F_FI_Taste/spicy, which i like
when it arrived it was still wrapped in the paper pouch in which it was F_FI_CookingLevel, so that was a bit of a mess
i get it
it keeps F_FoodItem P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm and F_FI_Taste very fresh when you open it yourself
but then i had this big piece of soggy parchment on my S_Cutlery  i had to ask a S_Staff to take it away
otherwise, the F_FI_Taste and Food were superb
despite the A_Env_Type, it's a Food well W_Price S_Delivery
what a great experience!  dinner was excellence and the F_Drinks were strong
the A_Ent_Music is loud but you shouldn't be going here for a quite dinner
Restaurant is great for the beginning to your night out
i P_O_Experience/recommend any of the F_FoodItem and the Food platter
soooooo much fun!!!! we had a couch under the awning across from the A_Ent_Music A_Fur_Table and right next to the A_Entertainment A_Fur_Table!!! perfect since we were gambling and will i am was dj'ing
we were A_Fur_Table next to two A_Fur_Table of peeps A_Environment 30's-40's and we all had a blast!!! this is not rehab!! Restaurant was serious parting going on, including some slipping and sliding
the A_Decor in the center of the pool brought out the inner S_Staff in a lot of girls who some how managed to have heels on up there??? the Food and F_Drinks were awesome and our S_Staff's valerie and will were so P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive!!  we did not meet the  minimum for our bed and she was able to quickly calculate the amount of shots required to meet our quota
again so much fun!! i will definitely P_O_Experience/go_back, you should too
unless your under 25 : )

came on a monday afternoon for Food
and F_FoodItem was P_Food/delicious! i've only had tapas twice and Restaurant was not a thing we S_Delivery that was not full of flavor and savored each and every F_Appetizer
we orederedF_FoodItem F_FoodItem: sweet with a little kick
loved the different Food of this dishceviche of F_FoodItem: i didnt eat it, cause im not a fan of the F_FoodItem
but my friends loved itstuffed dates: hands down my fave Food of the afternoon
it was sweet and savory and tongasmic
F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and a F_FI_Size of F_Ingredients in the center
how can you not love??F_FI_Religious & F_FoodItem F_FoodItem: the F_FI_Religious one was great and didnt feel like you were eating F_FoodItem wrapped in P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem
it was smooth and great flavor
the F_FoodItem was good but the F_FI_Religious was my favecamarones a la diabla: i didnt eat  the F_FoodItem cause im not a fan of the F_FoodItem, but the F_Ingredients that came with  it was  superb! we requested more F_FoodItem and i lathered it up with the F_Ingredients and inhaled it! albondigas: i love F_FoodItem but i had better
the F_FoodItem was a bit P_F_FI_Quality/tough and not as succulant as F_FoodItem should be
but F_FoodItem had P_F_FI_Taste/delicious flavor
just the texture of the F_FoodItem turned me offlamb skewers:  F_FoodItem was a bit P_F_FI_Quality/dry but non the less P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! must eat with the F_FoodItem, the F_Ingredients and the F_FoodItem  all together!filet mignon sliders: yum yum yum!def will P_O_Experience/come_back when im back in vegas!

my wife and i both lived in thailand for many years and so we enjoy trying out thai places in the valley
we were not P_O_Experience/disappointed with thai F_Ingredients
pleasant atmosphere (just about the only thai Restaurant i've been to with tablecloths
this could be a mistake since the usual way to eat thai Food -- passing around and sharing several Food -- can get messy)
we shared larb gai (P_F_FI_Taste/spicy minced F_FoodItem with mint and other things) and F_FoodItem
we can P_O_Experience/recommend both, and Restaurant was enough so we could bring some home
we had both Food at "spice 10," and it was quite hot, the way we like it
if you prefer it milder just get a lower number
well this one beats the other one in chandler they have a few more trays and a nicer Ambience
everything i ate was real good from the creamy clam chowder to the F_Desserts
this is my new favorite chinese Food in arizona
a couple of things wrong were,my F_FoodItem was still P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen and all the trays were not out at opening
they are new with new S_Staff so i hope they iron out these problems quickly other than that it was a great Food experience and i am going to put them on my top ten list for F_FoodItem
twist continues to impress
contemporary dining A_Places with illuminated glass globes suspended throughout, outstanding A_OutsideView of the strip, warm and efficient Service, and incredible Food
what more can you ask for?straight to the Food
the hudson valley foie
presented two ways
poached (sous-vide) served with a horseradish emulsion, tart sauerkraut and smoky morteau F_FoodItem
a great savory balance between earthy, tart, smoky F_FI_Taste all cutting the richness of the foie
second, "nuggets" of a foie terrine "glazed" with glenmorangie dusted with sweet and spicy gingerbread power and hazelnuts
the smoky undertones of the single malt accentuates the mineral, livery F_FI_Taste of the F_FoodItem
P_F_FI_Taste/delish
apple ice cream on the side; perfect
the dover sole & prawns is hard to top
the orange scented F_FoodItem ("glazed" with orange cider) is brought to life by an earthy morel cream and vegetal flavors of turnips, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
the addition of F_FoodItem adds sweetness and a nice oceanic F_FI_Taste
complex yet refreshing Foodthe list of great Food goes on and on
the degustation S_Menu are the best way to sample twist
A_Places are scaled down so no risk of over eating (unless you have the six course grand F_Dessert)
beautiful and delicious; just remember, you've been warned
note for F_FoodItem lovers:  twist offers the best W_Price japanese a5 wagyu F_FoodItem in vegas
offered as a new york F_FoodItem;  10 ounces, $198
of course, eating this would be boring
multiple revisits, always a twist!

i love the Food here, is it better than in n out?  not so sure
the F_FoodItem are definitely P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_Taste/delish
i got a F_FI_Size F_FoodItem and fries and holy moly was it alot of Food!  i think the little F_FoodItem would have been fine and i could have easily split one S_Delivery of fries with my two boys
they fill up the cup of fries, which is a good size and then dump more into the bag!  i took off one half of a star because of the W_Price, i thought it was pretty pricey for fast Food
i also took off one quarter of a star for the loudness, i couldn't even hear myself think A_Environment because the music was so loud
they lose another quarter of a star because they do not offer kids Food
now that i know portion size though, i can S_Delivery more appropriately because we had a bunch of Food leftover on our first visit here
all of the S_Staff are super nice and quick so all around i really like this place and would return
after reading some of the reviews, i was hesitant to try mm
however, tonight was my friends birthday so we all met here for dinner
the Ambience of the Restaurant is very "chain like", not really what i was expecting(yes, i do know it's a chain)
our S_Staff, ashley, was very nice, and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive
she didn't let any of our F_Drinks go with out refills, and she split our F_FI_Size A_Fur_Table's check for us with out us even having to ask!the Food was pretty good
we had the drunken fun S_Staff?) F_Appetizer and the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
both were good, not amazing, but good
Food F_FI_Taste a little 'processed' or maybe just not very P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fresh
the Food was good and P_F_FI_Taste/crisp, but had an almost P_F_FI_CookingLevel/microwaved Food to it, like it was old
i might give them another try, i just don't know if it's really the place for me
this is a good hawaiian grill! the macaroni F_FoodItem is the best around
support your local businesses people! this is the best Restaurant i've been to in this area
i waited until i had a few visits to review cartel
firs and foremost, great F_Drinks
i have S_Delivery lattes, chai, dirty chai, and the cold brew (toddy)
Food have been P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
the ratio with the chai/milk is pretty spot on and the F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/fantastic
i would say the cold brew is probably my go to F_Drinks from now on, though the Food is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
the S_Staff has always been very nice and P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful
W_Price seem to be a tinsy bit high but the F_Drinks is tasty so i keep going back
the shop is a littttle pretentious but not enough to deter me
give it a shot, you'll love the F_Drinks
nami is hands down my absolute favorite F_Dessert establishment in all of phoenixhere are a couple of words to describe nami's tsoynami
yummydeliciouswonderfulheaven in a cupthe perfect dessertthe tsoynami's are F_FI_Quality vegan soy ice cream which you can choose several different topping options with
there are several F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste as well as their own creations
Food are all extremely P_F_FI_Taste/delicious but i think my top 3 are as follows
1- dough boychocolate F_FoodItem F_FoodItem dough and organic chocolate2-no's 'n' mintnewman's chocolate o's, mint flavor, organic chocolate3- clunky monkey (gf)fresh banana, organic F_FoodItem, organic chocolatethe Service at nami is wonderful as each S_Staff is very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Experience/knowledgable of the S_Menu but they also provide very helpful tips also, the cookies are fabulous, the cakes are scrumptious, and the F_Drinks is perfect
one of my favorite thai Food places in vegas!

because i've changed my eating habits and have successfully lost quite a bit of weight, i try to eat A_Decor for my mid-day Food
today was an exception as S_Staff craig wanted us to try out two special F_FoodItem
the hawaiian F_FoodItem and the brie F_FoodItem
my husband was able to try the Food last week, but this was my big chance and it did not P_O_Experience/disappoint
the hawaiian is 100% angus F_FoodItem (i get the 1/3lb F_FoodItem) topped with P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/melted swiss, F_FoodItem slices, P_F_FI_Size/thin sliced F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, mayo and crushed F_FoodItem
i'm going to coin a 90's phrase that i feel is appropriate to describe this F_FoodItem
orgasmic
honestly
i felt the earth move when i bit into this F_FoodItem
the creamy texture of the avocado paired so nicely with the sweetness of the pineapple
the F_FI_Taste of the ham was just right
it was sheer perfection between a sliced F_FoodItem! the brie F_FoodItem is also 100% angus F_FoodItem topped with P_F_FI_Size/thin sliced F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, sauteed F_FoodItem, and a slice of brie F_FoodItem
it is also amazing as well
the creamy yet tart flavor of the brie really lent itself nicely to the angus F_FoodItem and even though my son likes his F_FoodItem P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled well done, F_FoodItem was still juicy and P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful
i can't speak highly enough about ny F_FI_Taste
i can't wait to P_O_Experience/go_back later this week to try something new!

went here for dinner last night with two friends
as others pointed out, the A_Decor is beautiful, rustic yet classy however the Service was below average and the Food was ok
S_Staff forgot our wine S_Delivery, had to come back to the A_Fur_Table twice to ask us what we S_Delivery
the Food took an incredibly long S_Del_Time to come out and Restaurant was only two or three additional A_Fur_Table filled
we asked to have the bill split three ways, it took the S_Staff three tries to get it correct
overall, it's probably a nice A_Plc_Bar to enjoy a F_Drinks but i would not P_O_Experience/recommend it for a nice dinner out
we stopped here for a quick F_Appetizer and F_Drinks because my fiancé is a huge ramsay fan
we got the american kobe F_FoodItem sliders (wtf is that really?) which were about $18 for 2, but well W_Price it (especially when our entire tab was comped by trent's casino host)
the presentation was whatever and the W_Price was high, but let me just say that those things melted in your mouth
it was like eating a filet mignon mini-F_FoodItem
fantabulous!  i wish we would have know that someone else was O_Payment, because we definitely would have sprung for the F_FoodItem for 2
oh well, live and learn
given the typical airport Food joints, beaudevin is a breath of fresh A_Env_AC in the midst of clt's chaos
great place to spend some S_Del_Time in between flights
S_Menu is pretty good and the small S_Cutlery are perfect pairings
happiest hour! we went to the fleetwood mac concert at us airways last night and one of our group had heard that they have an amazing Offers
they couldn't have been more right
they have a nice selection of draft F_Drinks (not super extensive) but either 2 or 3 bucks at Offers, and some killer selections of Food for the 3-5 dollar range
the S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and the vibe was great for pre A_Entertainment before a A_Entertainment
this is my new stop before any concert or event downtown
my wife called to ask if they had a Offers
the S_Staff that answered said yes, please see it online
my wife looked and when we got here (i'm here now lol), they said "oh yea our website is old
strike one
seaweed F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Size/small
edamame small
strike 2 was when i asked for a A_Fur_Table away from the front door and was told they were "reserved"
at 530pm!? ok !the F_FoodItem was average
very P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem
very loud due to teppan right next to F_FoodItem
all in an A_Environment
Restaurant are no A_Decor or anything
strike 3 was when they brought out my S_Delivery with only half of the nigiri
weird, if you write "1" for nigiri it's literal, not in pairs as about every other F_FoodItem place i've been to for 20 years all over the globe, does!well i asked for the rest of the S_Delivery and i was told if have to be out at the back of the line
meaning i'd be waiting much too long
ridiculous
the F_FoodItem was average
very small pieces
very loud due to teppan right next to F_FoodItem
all in an open area
Restaurant are no A_Decor or anything
sakana and mido are better in all ways
i'd be P_O_Experience/surprised to see them make it to 2014
fantastic! i've watched shows where the host goes to a Restaurant, tries their Food and explains the flavors, textures, and so forth
i never really understood until i came to this Restaurant
so i'm going to keep it simple: this Restaurant's Food is P_F_FI_Quality/clean, P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, made to S_Delivery
you can F_FI_Taste every single F_Ingredients, layer by layer
a must go-back-to
if you like trendy joints check it out
the one S_Staff had good customer Service since he switched an order to something else nicely
the Food not that good
their specialty are the F_FoodItem!! you cant go wrong
the F_Ingredients fries are freakin amazing! i requested for sweet F_Ingredients fries (F_Appetizer)
the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem with 3 strips of F_Ingredients was def not W_Price the money
coulda made that myself
amazing foooood!!!!that calamari is to die for, it has slices of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and freshly made tartar F_Ingredients that has a kick of F_Ingredients
the 4 F_FoodItem P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem is superb! F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste like a P_F_FI_Taste/crispy F_FoodItem and when paired with the homemade F_FoodItem soup it is magical
lolthis is not your traditional pizza place it's fresh it's gormet and full of flavor!! the F_FoodItem put some high dollar restuarants to shame
love love love

loved this place! sat out of the A_Plc_Patio today for Food to watch some of the opening day red sox A_Entertainment
Food is amazing
S_Delivery the ipswich F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem which were relish and straight out of a cape cod S_Menu
husband had the Food, which was enormous and enough to bring home half for dinner
F_Drinks selection - more than worthy
i had the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem Food special and was everything i expected it to be
thanks for the cracker jacks tim! this place is great, be back very soon

i am saddened by the demise of this Restaurant
we walked in and had to "yoo hoo" to get S_Staff/S_Staff attention
the Restaurant was pitifully empty on a saturday night at 7:30
we S_Delivery our usual F_FoodItem satay F_Appetizer which was not "as good as usual", F_FoodItem was on the dry side and the peanut F_Ingredients was lumpy
as wew waited for our Food, i saw a bug on the floor which i had to deal with under the weight of my flip flop
it was then that i noticed how utterly filthy the A_Places was
my husband agreed, the place had undeniably succumbed to a fate several ethnic Restaurant at this very location have suffered
we pondered what else could be unwashed beside the floors and what else could possibly be creepy crawlin around the A_Plc_Kitchen
i left with the heebie jeebies and we both agreed we would not venture back
so very sad :(

whenever i am in this (lame) part of town, i try to go to this P_A_Env_Size/little Restaurant
today i had their F_FoodItem F_FoodItem with mole
always amazing! love this place and wish they would be closer to the west side!

we S_Delivery a 10" F_FoodItem with gluten-free crust
with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
they said delivery would take about an hour, and they were right
we're literally a mile from them so that was kind of crazy but they told us ahead of S_Del_Time so not a huge deal
i can't comment on what the Restaurant looks like on the inside because i've never been
we'll S_Delivery again but the lack of F_FoodItem will ensure that this isn't our F_FI_Size F_FoodItem spot
even with us getting *extra* F_FoodItem, there still wasn't a lot
i'm a total F_FoodItemaholic, so that was P_O_Experience/disappointing
Food was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot and P_F_FI_Quality/fresh, F_FI_Taste were great, delivery S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
can't really complain
:)

i really P_O_Experience/enjoyed the Food!  very creative hispanic Food and F_FoodItem as well
the atmosphere is quite nice as well
this place is brand new and has the formula down pat
go now grass hopper!

i'm just an avid F_FoodItem lover in a town filled with japanese-influenced Food, but it isn't as easy to find a great Restaurant for such a raw delicacy as you might think
furthermore, it is even more difficult to find a place that has P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem, scrumptious Food, great and P_S_Stf_Behavior/welcoming S_Staff, and a vivacious Ambience
do i need to say anymore? come see why kanji has such a high rating for yourself
i had Food here yesterday before the A_Entertainment with a few friends
i have also been Restaurant a few times upstairs
i really liked the fact that we had no problem getting a A_Fur_Table at the A_Plc_Bar or a A_Fur_Table
i usually go to the A_Plc_Bar on the north shore prior to A_Environment, but this was a lot less Ambience and good for the group i was with
in fact, truth be told the Restaurant was only about 1/2 full (on bucs opening day!?)
the Food was okay
i tried these F_FoodItem which were good and interesting because it had a decent F_FI_Quality F_FoodItem as the F_FoodItem and not just ground F_FoodItem
i also really liked the sweet F_FoodItem
they were delicious and you usually can't get these at too many places
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
it was a ton of F_FoodItem, however some of the F_FoodItem was a little F_FI_CookingLevel and it was F_Ingredients cold
i can understand serving cool even though id prefer warm, but F_Ingredients cold really wasn't that good when they put warm F_Ingredients on it
i also tried the F_Appetizer, which was really rich and had a good P_F_FI_Taste/spicy flavor
the only thing missing in the F_Appetizer was the F_FoodItem
a minor oversight i imagine
overall, a pretty decent Restaurant when you are looking to just have a few F_Drinks with friends
i've also tried the upstairs A_Plc_Bar which is the more upscale section
the A_Plc_Bar is Ambience which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of A_Fur_Table including A_Furniture
the Offers is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 pm
overall a decent place for quiet F_Drinks without the crowds and a little better than average Food
we sat at the A_Plc_Bar and only ate F_FoodItem, but all-in-all it was an excellent O_Experience!  S_Staff and the other S_Staff (sorry i forgot her name
she was very sweet) were on top of it, and Service was excellent
the F_FoodItem were F_FI_Taste and F_Drinks were good too
they made our charlotte O_Experience better
thanks!

i just had Food at the phoenix city grille
the Food was pretty good, but the Service was not the best
i got the F_FoodItem, and it was pretty good
we were Service quickly, but the S_Staff didn't come check on us for several minutes
i needed F_Ingredients for the F_FoodItem, but i had to wait at least S_Del_Time for the S_Staff to return to ask for it
i also had a F_Drinks
it was good, but the S_Staff never asked if i cared for another
the S_Staff only asked me if i wanted more F_Drinks when it was S_Del_Time to leave the Restaurant
it also seemed to take awhile to get the check and O_Payment for the Food
the Restaurant was only moderately busy, and it seems like they only had a few S_Staff working
i really don't fault the S_Staff
it just seems like S_Staff was waiting on too many people
very nice S_Staff excellent Food and a great place to see live bands

************the dinner plates are
a good value**************          the dinner plates come with a nice size F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem
plus a side of F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
we've eaten here three times
the first time was disappointing
the last two times
have been outstanding
the F_FoodItem are very generous
and the seasoning right on
my wife enjoyed her F_FoodItem
my F_FoodItem
the best i've had in arizona

of course if they claim to have the best F_FoodItem F_FoodItem-i had to try them
i liked the F_FoodItem, nice F_FI_Size pieces, deep F_FI_CookingLevel, not too heavy on the F_Ingredients
although i found the F_FoodItem a bit dry, and i didn'S_Staff think their F_Ingredients was anything special-but at least they had F_Ingredients! i asked for just the F_FoodItem and they charged me and gave me the entire Food, therefore only three stars
and my search for awesome F_FoodItem F_FoodItem continues
we went here for our anniversary tonight
i havent ate a red F_FoodItem for 10 years because of how gross it was! but we decided it was time again after reentering the real world ( we justed moved back from the bush alaska)
and to tell you it wasnt bad at all
i really enjoyed my Food and Service! and my F_Drinks actually had alcohol in it

ok, so i've never been a fan of domino's in the past and i can't say much has changed since they said they had redone their recipe for a "F_FI_Quality F_FoodItem
the F_Ingredients is just too overly seasoned
that really turns me off
it F_FI_Taste like they put way too much F_Ingredients combined with mrs
dash on it, ew
the texture is ok, but it's really not doing it for me
i prefer F_FoodItem hut or papa john's still if i'm going for a W_Price F_FoodItem on the quick
if i ever leave las vegas capriotti's will be the only thing i miss
this is the only capriotti's i went to that had an actual dine in sit down area
all the other capriotti's i've gone to had 2 or 3 A_Fur_Table for their Ambience and that was it
i think they put F_Ingredients on all of their F_FoodItem so i always S_Delivery w/no F_FoodItem since i'm not a fan of it
my favorite F_FoodItem here is the F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was ok and the F_FoodItem is always a good choice
they have plenty of other F_FoodItem to choose from but i haven't tried any others because i always get the F_FoodItem  the W_Price here are a little more than what you'd expect from a F_FoodItem place but i feel like it's definitely W_Price it and it's still very reasonable
a sF_FI_Size F_FoodItem is around $7, a F_FI_Size 12 inch is $9 and a F_FI_Size 20 inch is $13
every time you eat here they give you a $3 off coupon for your next visit
you have to go online and fill out a short questionnaire but it's W_Price it to get some money off for your next visit
other than the F_Ingredients overload the only thing i don't like about this place is that they close at 8 but they are still deserving of 5 stars despite of that
after nearly 4 years i've finally ventured out to chaya
what took me so long?  i'm always mildly hesitant about F_FoodItem when i'm in a city not by the coast, but a man does what he's gotta do when he's got a craving
three of us S_Delivery a F_FoodItem combination platter to split as well as our own Food
i S_Delivery F_FoodItem, my friend S_Delivery F_FoodItem and my last friend is boring
first came the F_FoodItem
it was pretty standard, but any sign of F_Ingredients is a good thing for the college male
next up was their F_FoodItem
ohmygoodness it was the best F_FoodItem i have ever had
now i've never had F_FoodItem in japan, but lots of people hyped it up for me and i was scared it would be a letdown
the flesh was so flavorful and juicy it completely blew my mind away and left me craving more as soon as it was over
droolF_Appetizer was also pretty standard
the F_FoodItem combination was a disappointment
yes, we had it coming for S_Delivery a platter of F_FoodItem, but it was only b/c the F_FoodItem/F_FoodItem platters would have either been too F_FI_Size (the 70 dollar boats) or too small (the 10 piece combo's)
in retrospect we should have just S_Delivery a F_FoodItem
i noticed halfway through the Food they had anago available that night too
my F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
personally i love F_FoodItem cheeks (as well as the part of F_FoodItem right by the tail when i S_Delivery F_FoodItem whole)
it's super F_FI_CookingLevel and rich and F_FI_Taste so delicate
my end of the bill came out to be around 30, which was perfectly
i would've been perfectly happy if we had dropped the F_FoodItem combination and i had picked up a piece of F_FoodItem and a piece of F_FoodItem instead
Service was excellent and the their timing was impeccable; they have it all down to an A_Decor
the next time i'm back i completely want to try their F_FoodItem
in japanese it means "it's up to you" with "you" being the S_Staffi was slightly disappointed when i saw my companions throw their wasabi into F_Ingredients and completely mix it up
that is not how F_FoodItem should be eaten
cabo is my favorite Restaurant
as a huge F_FoodItem/F_FoodItem lover i am always in heaven when i visit
no matter what you S_Delivery everything is always F_FI_Quality and F_FI_Taste
the S_Menu items aren't overly complicated and the featured specials are always a hit
two thumbs up!

W_Price every damn W_Price
who wouldn't love this Restaurant?? the wAmbience is F_FoodItem so we S_Delivery F_FoodItem
S_Delivery it at 1:39
he rings my bell at 1:50
needless to say the Food is great
from S_Delivery to receiving its an all around good experience
very A_Decor mexican Restaurant that has horrible Service from old ladies who can't hear or move fast enough to keep your F_Drinks filled
and the place smells very bad
i suggest a little remodeling along with some spring cleaning
since my last review i have been here many times and i must say Restaurant Service has improved a lot!  i really do love their Food
as of late i am stuck on their artesian F_FoodItem melt
yum!  so they get another star:)

went to grab a quick F_Appetizer yesterday with a colleague and we decided to go to pita house
big mistake
we called in our S_Delivery and the S_Staff on the phone seemed like it we were putting her out
i guess the computer in the non Restaurant section (where we'd be picking up our Food) was down
we weren't told how long it would be or how much our S_Delivery was going to cost
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem with the house F_FoodItem
we head over, O_Payment and get out S_Delivery (the gal seemed iS_Stf_Behavior to have to walk over to the other side to run the card), and head back to work
i dive into my Food and something is off
the F_FoodItem was F_FI_Quality, like wilted warm
who wants to eat warm floppy F_Ingredients?  anyone
anyone
bueller?    my F_FoodItem was drowning in tzatziki
i ended up throwing most of my Food away -  Restaurant was no salvaging any of it
not sure if Restaurant's new S_Staff or S_Staff
but the F_FI_Quality and Service has definitely gone downhill
if i return, it wont be for a while
ive been here like 5 times now and the only thing i get is the F_FoodItem that's the only reason i give it a 5 star lol can't speak for anything else!anyway, the F_FoodItem are amazing
i hate when F_FoodItem are soggy on the outside,  but these are perrrfect, F_FI_Taste on the outside but still smothered in F_Ingredients
i get the F_FoodItem and my boyfriend usually gets the F_FoodItem and they are both P_F_FI_Taste/delish
and it comes with fF_Appetizer!  10 F_FoodItem & seasoned F_FI_CookingLevel for like 8 bucks, always hits the spot and fills me up

the outdoor A_Fur_Table is great with the A_OutsideView in the A_OutsideView
the Food was mediocre, while the Service was good and outdoor A_Fur_Table great, i would O_Experience secondary to the F_FI_Quality of the Food
to note: they serve until 2 am!

never had a bad Food here
good F_FoodItem F_FoodItems and F_Drinks
the place is always crowded
great for people watching
i've been Restaurant twice and this place is awesome! the first S_Del_Time i went it was very packed for the usa world cup A_Entertainment
i split the pretzel F_Appetizer, which came with F_FoodItem
the pretzels were F_FI_Size and really F_FI_CookingLevel, soft, and great
i shared the tap room tenderloin and S_Delivery it with F_Ingredients
it was F_FI_CookingLevel perfectly and the chipotle really enhanced the F_FI_Taste
would definitely recommend
shared a F_FoodItem which was really great and refreshing on a hot summer day
the second time i went with family from new jersey who are quite picky folks
they had just gotten in from a long flight and were starved
they were super O_Experience with the F_Drinks, both of my parents S_Delivery flights and loved all
as for F_Appetizer- we S_Delivery the buffalo F_FoodItem, which to our pleasant surprise were way F_FI_Taste than expected, the F_FoodItem artichoke dip, which was filled with way more F_FI_Taste than i had ever had, the F_FoodItem, which was superb, and a F_FoodItem/F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
every single Food that touched my sunbru cleansed palette was amazing
not one thing was bland, they were all kicked with amazing F_FI_Taste and combinations i could never replicate
can't wait to keep trying the great things on the S_Menu!

for the W_Price and the amount of Food you get, i think it's only ok
i'm a small little girl with a tiny stomach
i went to earls afterwards and put down a F_FoodItem, a F_Appetizer, and half a F_FoodItem
the Service was great tho
it's just a little too quiet in here for me
i almost fell asleep
del inferno, mi corazonthis dt caught my eye one night while we were driving back to our room
had i been driving, we surely would have been rear-ended because i have a tendency to slam on my brakes when i see their happy signs
note: i only S_Delivery crunchy F_FoodItem
whether i'm at del F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem bell, i do not stray from my simple S_Delivery: between 3 and 8 crunchy F_FoodItem
i usually prefer them with A_Decor F_FoodItem and extra F_Ingredients
they have to have 3 packets of hot F_Ingredients (i like to use one mild, one F_FI_Size, and one hot) and a half-packet of F_Ingredients so here we are in vegas and i see dt, so of course (!) i made my husband park even though we'd been on our feet all day and were exhausted
we found a S_Parking spot several blocks away and walked through a detour for construction and around some dark corners until we were finally back on the strip and headed up to the Food court
a P_S_Stf_Behavior/polite S_Staff gave me my F_FoodItem ($1
59 each) and the night was complete
del F_FoodItem - please come to walnut creek, ca :)  xoxo

stoped by with the A_Env_Type for my little sister's birthday, S_Delivery a F_FoodItemF_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem were F_FI_Size and F_FI_Taste, the F_FoodItem, also very F_FI_Size and F_FI_Taste
the have these amazing super F_FI_Size shoestring F_Appetizer with F_Appetizer seasoning
first time i've been to this A_LocatedArea, usually frequent town square but is very comparable
Service is very Service between the two
F_FI_Size A_Places, good Restaurant, great Service, and plenty of A_Fur_Table
a little bit W_Price depending what you S_Delivery, but overall a nice dining experience
probably the best F_FoodItem in town
wood fired oven (used for F_FoodItem, of course) also bakes their own F_FoodItem, and wonderfully F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem for their vege, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_Appetizer
they have a nice short list of house F_FoodItem, or build your own to suit
obscure S_Menu is fine, no harm trying a selection you haven't heard of before
F_Dessert are all homemade as well
best F_Drinks i have ever had
the french kiss F_Drinks with bailey's and kahlua
and this is coming from someone who worked at baskin robbins through high school
F_FoodItem were awesome
my boyfriend and i chose the angus build-a-F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem were F_FI_CookingLevel perfectly and we really liked the ciabatta F_FoodItem
the jalapeno F_Ingredients was awesome
the Food was really F_FI_CookingLevel and good for dipping the sweet F_Appetizer
we will definitely return!

S_Staff colicchio, the naming of a Restaurant cannot be more apt
and forgive little ole me for claiming that you, sir, got the craft of F_FoodItem, down to a science
in my experience, while other F_FoodItem Restaurant excel on F_FoodItem, they typically fall apart when it comes to a collective experience with the inclusion of the sides
our selections of  the F_FoodItem risotto, F_Ingredients gratinand brentwood sweet cF_Ingredients had our A_Fur_Table clamoring for more
oh, how i wish to revisit the evening soon
i have been to the great dane for dinning and for just drinking on several occasions
i love the A_Decor of the Ambience and the A_Decor
the dane F_FoodItem is great
i also enjoy the F_FoodItem
if you just want F_Appetizer i recommend the F_Appetizer F_Appetizer and F_Appetizer! of course you can't forget the F_Drinks sampler!

maybe i am just a sucker for Food, but i like this place
it isnt the best i've had
they dont have a F_FoodItem section, just some F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem, and clams and F_FoodItem (F_FI_CookingLevel), which are good nuff for me, considering the W_Price
it is $18
95 sat-thru dinner, which is more reasonable than other hotel F_FoodItem in vegas
friday night is F_FoodItem night, but i've never been
my fave items here are: F_FoodItem (fill up on these), F_FoodItem with F_Ingredients sprinkled on top, F_FoodItem cream rotellini
the F_FoodItem is decent (F_FI_Taste F_FoodItem being the best) and they have a "make your own F_FoodItem" station, for the picky eaters, about 40 different F_Dessert (F_Dessert is best)
and the F_FoodItem, while F_FI_CookingLevel, has a little funk on the F_Ingredients
it's borderline F_Ingredients F_FoodItem F_FoodItem-ish
they should stick to one
a cross between F_FI_Size kansas city F_FoodItem F_Ingredients and hoisin based F_Ingredients isnt that great on the palate
nothing much to complain about
not too many people know about this place, so it is never crowded the 3 times i've gone (i go to vegas quite a bit my friends)
Service is ok
and place is A_Places, so you will be A_Fur_Table :)

i'm a little late on writing this since i was in vegas over super bowl weekend, but it's still W_Price writing about
this would have been the best Restaurant i've ever been to, but it sadly wasn't
this evening, i wanted to Service my gf out to a great dinner before hitting up zumanity
as usual, we ran a few minutes late, but 10 minutes isn't anything to fuss over at 99
9% of Restaurant
however, it took them over W_Waiting to A_Fur_Table us
umm
with a show we don't want to be late for, that's some crumby management of A_Fur_Table
for the most part, the Service was top notch and the S_Staff was great
for dinner we S_Delivery the F_FoodItem the foir gras torchon, an iceberg F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem sides, and a great F_Dessert
the Food was, for the most part, superb
even the sides were as decadent as the hibernate entrée
i just wish we had had more time
the F_FoodItem in the chateaubriand was juicy, F_FI_CookingLevel, and everything one could hope for as far as red F_FoodItem goes
the F_FoodItem was excellent, just a little rich for my palate
i've had F_FoodItem every way you could have it and honestly, i prefer pan seared
in the end, we had a rushed dinner because of being A_Fur_Table late, getting the check took forever because of some "system problem", and we ended up being late to zumanity!  grrrr!it ended up being okay though, because when we got Restaurant, one of the "actors" gave us shit about being late, but after we explained what happened, he hooked us up with front row/couch A_Fur_Table!  thanks, sw for the cirque upgrade, i guess
spoiler alert: the bill is average $120 per person
with that being said, if you want to be a foodie
or at least S_Stf_Behavior the part
or just be Service like you own the bellagio for a night, come right on down
it's located down the escalators and it will be one of the most decadent Food of your life
i don't claim to know F_Drinks or F_Drinks but i know they must be seriously good for the W_Price they offer and the S_Staff is great about suggesting pairings with your Food
what i do claim to know is F_FI_Taste Food and that they do deliver
you can pick from 2 S_Menu: the degustation S_Menu (5 course) or the prix fixe (4 course)
with only a $10 difference, i opted for the 5 course
i will summarize because many have F_FI_Taste the gloriousness that i have and have lived to write about it as well
maine F_FoodItem F_FoodItem: F_FoodItem as in F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, etc
cool, refined, and accentuates the F_FoodItem
not overly drowned in superfluous additives like mayo
pan-seared F_FoodItem:  i have F_FI_Taste F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem
but this was A_Decor-perfect, cut-with a fork, sophisticatedly simple
F_FoodItem F_FoodItem probably my least favorite but only by personal F_FI_Taste
nice blacked F_Ingredients with a tangy center
basically blackened foie gras
kobe filet mignon: yes ladies and gentlemen, i chose to add $160 to my Food and try this heavenly cut of F_FoodItem
perfectly marbled and juicy (recommended F_FI_Size-rare)
while i may not agree that it should cost an additional $160, i cannot deny that it was the highlight of my dinner and probably the best cut of F_FoodItem i have ever F_FI_Taste
also accompanied by a the best ring of mashed F_Ingredients but still no contest
you can get kobe cuts across the street at gordon ramsay F_FoodItem in paris and frankly better than Food i've eaten in my life (until i ate at picasso)
F_Dessert:  by now you will be full and probably not appreciate the choice as much as you should
tough choices
but if you make it this far, congratulations and here's to hoping payday comes soon after this Food
great S_Staff
they know that for a lot of us, this Food hurts the pockets, but S_Staff S_Stf_Behavior you through it and they talk like all those fancy S_Staff in the movies too

not the best place, but the S_Staff was giving outstanding Service
why on earth would S_Staff aaron sanchez put his name on any of the Food at this Restaurant?! horrible! F_FI_Taste! don't waste your W_Waiting on Food
perhaps as a A_Ent_Music venue it is ok, but the Food was disgusting
i S_Delivery an F_Appetizer of F_FoodItem wings
sure the crunch was spot on but it was under F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem itself F_FI_Taste like worn out shoe leather
i followed this by one of S_Staff sanchez's signature Food - a half rack of ribs
one F_Appetizer into it and i was sorely F_Appetizer
the F_FoodItem must have been F_FI_CookingLeveld or F_FI_CookingLevel
it too was F_FI_Taste
to cover this up, it was slathered with a F_Ingredients that F_FI_Taste like F_Ingredients with hints of cayenne
this is not at all what i expected from an adobo F_Ingredients
it was just straight up yuck! i had it all packaged up to take back to my hotel and was so angry i tossed it in the garbage as i walked back to my room
shame on you aaron sanchez
either take your good name off such horse-menure Food or fire your executive S_Staff and get someone who knows how to make it the way you intended it
Restaurant is adorable, the S_Staff give great Service and the Food is F_FI_Taste
what's not to love!?

3
5 starsour S_Staff was incredibly nice and the calamari F_Appetizer was F_FI_Taste
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem and the description made it sound like F_FoodItem with marinara F_Ingredients and F_FoodItem
it was actually like a F_FoodItem, which is not my favorite thing and having the linguini sitting in seafood F_Ingredients wasn't great
if you like cioppino though, they are very generous with the seafood
my bf got the F_FoodItem and he said it was way too P_F_FI_Healthy/salty
still pretty good, but it needed more F_Ingredients or something to balance out the F_Ingredients
we were kind of disappointed, which is sad because we love this place, especially the one in la
this place is amazing! i had the best F_FoodItem ever
the ribs were do F_FI_CookingLevel, the F_FoodItem melted in my mouth and the mac n F_FoodItem was so good too! O_Experience this place
the S_Staff were S_Stf_Behavior and donny, S_Staff,  really S_Stf_Behavior that we were happy
as visitors to phoenix this past weekend, our group decided we wanted some F_FI_Taste mexican Food
we found a review for this place online and drove about 20 minutes (to what seemed like bfe) and finally arrived with hungry bellies
we were S_Stf_Behavior by all 5 of the ladies standing near the entrance who A_Fur_Table us quickly
our S_Staff arrived at our A_Fur_Table quickly for our F_Drinks S_Delivery and was quite P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful
my only complaint about the Service is that my friend's father wanted to try their $4 rita-tini (?) that was advertised on the A_Decor that was made with 3 amigos F_Drinks
when he asked for the $4 special, we were told it was strictly for Offers
the sign itself said absolutely nothing about Offers - and the only reason i mention this is because every other sign in the A_Plc_Bar that offered a F_Drinks special -only for Offers- designated that clearly on the sign
the S_Staff wasn't P_S_Stf_Appearance/amused when he jokingly asked if she could make an exception
our Food were simply F_FI_Taste
the carne asada was easily the best carne asada i've ever had, and being from southern california i would like to think we have quite the selection
i personally S_Delivery a 2 F_FoodItem tacos plate, which included F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was F_FI_CookingLevel differently from any other place i have ever been to, it was incredibly juicy and surprisingly F_FI_Tastel
i couldn't pin point exactly what the other people at my A_Fur_Table had S_Delivery, but we were all settling into Food comas shortly after commencing our delightful Food (which wasn't the best thing considering we all had a 5 hour drive to make back to california)
if i ever find myself in phoenix again, or even somewhere remotely close by- i would definitely stop in for another Food
we went here at 5 pm for Food with my adult kids to celebrate my wife's birthday
the Service was great
S_Staff seemed S_Stf_Appearance and friendly
my kids love the F_FoodItem that was suggested by the S_Staff, we even S_Delivery the second one
my wife was happy getting an S_Delivery from my kids a giant fortune F_FoodItem with a "happy birthday" written on the plate
we went home with a good memory and would like to come back when we are in vegas next S_Del_Time
we found this Restaurant via opentable
com for our 10th wedding anniversary
the A_OutsideView isn't bad
the palms hotel is not on the strip
you would have to take a cab to get Restaurant
the average fare for a single trip: $10my husband S_Delivery a F_FoodItemi
i forgot the name of Food
out of world! good A_Places of F_FoodItem
i S_Delivery a F_FoodItem
my gosh, the F_FoodItem was so juicy and i decided to keep some for home so i could enjoy chewing the F_FoodItem
W_Price a trip!

this Restaurant is definitely just ok
for $200 plus for three people i expect more
Food ok, nothing special
you can get better at wendy's asian Restaurant on spring mountain and jones!  and definitely better Food and Service at raku
japanaise is a lovely looking Restaurant with very cool Ambience but it ends Restaurant
i didn't like having a paper overlay on my tablecloth or the fact that the busboy took my fork off my used F_Appetizer plate and placed it back on the A_Fur_Table for me to use on entrée
also, one of the three F_Appetizer arrived ten minutes after the other two were served
wanted to be polite, so i waited, and then my Food was cold when i got to eat it
what is the delay in getting a hamachi F_Appetizer to the A_Fur_Table?  i truly throught they forgot my daughter's S_Delivery it took so long
i also said it was a birthday dinner when i made O_Reservation and was told they acknowledge it
also whispered it to S_Staff
nothing!  i am local and think i expect more Service
i won't be coming back for sure
goodness gracious alive, do i ever love this Restaurant
i head out to u
F_FoodItem a couple of sundays a month with my roomie and her pops
we are A_Fur_Table W_Waiting, and any number of leggy beauties are at our beck and call for the entirety of our stay
the S_Staff is gracious, and the S_Staff are perpetually P_S_Stf_Behavior/smiling
the vibe is A_Decor
the clientele runs from old folks to hipsters to the hangover crowd
the S_Menu has quite a bit to choose from, but i always have the F_FoodItem florentine (try it; i promise you won't regret it)
i've heard tell that the F_FI_Religious benedict and F_FoodItem over easy are remarkable, as well
S_Staff leave a pitcher of F_Ingredients cold F_Drinks with us as we eat--they don't pester us or rush us or hint that we need to leave, even when our conversations run long
i can't think of a better place to get Food
the F_FoodItem is good
i looove the Ambience
it is young and fun
yes, Restaurant is amigos
but a wise man would know that F_FoodItem is not about that, but the dedication and love of the Food
i eat here once a week
i do have to agree though that the F_Appetizer or F_Dessert are not included
but its good and they Service you well
i used to go here a lot for Food when i worked in old town, if the line wasn't super long
the F_FoodItem are F_FI_Healthy, all the while keeping it really F_FI_Taste
Food i have tried has not disappointed and the F_Drinks is so good
F_FoodItem club was my usual Food S_Delivery
sardella's does a pretty decent F_FoodItem and with the location it's convenient to stop in an pick one up on the way home
that's about as good as it gets
it's like F_FoodItem the F_FI_Size when you S_Delivery from here
you ask for blue F_FoodItem with your F_FoodItem you get ranch
you S_Delivery a F_FoodItem without an F_Ingredients you are allergic to, you might get the F_Ingredients anyway
and honestly, how hard is it to cut a F_FoodItem
i don't think i've ever been to a F_FoodItem place that has cut a F_FoodItem in a way that Restaurant were little triangle pieces in the middle
not just once, but 3 times
today was the last straw, i truly saw what was behind this locations issues
i spoke to a S_Staff behind the counter that appeared to be running the store about my last F_FoodItem that was supposed to be half works, but ended up less than a third covered with F_Ingredients
his feed back was "yeah?', 'have you ever tried to make a F_FoodItem?'
are you kidding me? i told him i was only trying to bring it to his attention and he continued on with 'listen, i have to feed 100 people/hour'
that's a great attitude and clearly shows that F_FI_Quality assurance is not sardella's primary objective
take it for what it is, i've been coming to this location on just about a weekly basis but i can confidently say that i can only put up with so much
love this place!  i could eat here all the time
i always go for Food with friends or for dinner with A_Env_Type
great for kids
Restaurant is grass for the kids to run around on
it is like going on a picnic at the park but with great Food
we go about once a month! well maybe more!

F_FoodItem were F_FI_Taste
S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful
just made a quick stop before a concert with my lady
i will definantley try to go back next time i'm in the area
!!

i had the worst F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (salmon skin F_FoodItem) in my life here! it was F_FI_CookingLevel
other F_FoodItem and sashimi are medocre at best
mido and kabuki are way better than this place
pho-gettaboudit
not O_Experience, the spring F_FoodItem were over-F_FI_CookingLevel and the F_FoodItem in the pho was no bueno
the others at my A_Fur_Table seemed to enjoy their Food, but i think they're just used to being let down
also, let me stand on my soap box and announce something to all small business S_Staff
you don't like it when people O_Payment with credit or debit cards?  you don'S_Staff like O_Payment that 3-4
5% fee for electronic O_Payment customers?  huh
well guess what
you should build that into your W_Price!  'cause guess what?  no one likes to see a sign that they will be O_Payment 50 cents or whatever extra just because they don't have cash
it rubs me the wrong way almost every time - and i know i'm not the only one
so - in the best interest of your getting people to return and recommend your place of business to others?  get with the 21st century and suck it up - debit / credit cards aren't going anywhere
my parents owned a korean Restaurant so i know good korean Food! i enjoyed their kalbi (F_FoodItem) kalbi tang (short rib soup) bulgogi (F_FI_Size marinated F_FoodItem) F_Appetizer with F_FoodItem and their F_FoodItem
Restaurant has been times where the side Food weren't as good
for instance the F_FoodItem kimchi was soggy and F_FoodItem sprouts were bland but the hibernate Food made up for it
they do get busy so the S_Staff button that's on every A_Fur_Table comes in handy when you need something
the iceberg F_FoodItem with what was kindly called "F_FoodItem", actually just "buttermilk" i'm pretty sure
was sub-optimal
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were good, and the special i got the night i went was freaking amazing
overall, it was a semi-quiet place to sit and have a Food, the S_Staff were very P_S_Stf_Behavior/polite and excellent, i was never wanting for a F_Drinks, and everything ran very smoothly
F_FoodItem - real good
sweet, sweet gluttonous maizie's
i always emerge from the dimly A_Decor A_Plc_Bar riddled with guilt at my lack of self control, but i keep coming back for more! S_Parking is hectic and the Restaurant remains consistently busy, but neither are such an issue that i would feel hesitant to come here
the inside has urban swank and remains unpretentious
the S_Staff is S_Stf_Behavior but not S_Stf_Behavior
and the Food
oh god, the Food! the buffalo F_FoodItem dip is cheesy, high calorie, ooey gooey F_FI_Taste
huge chunks of partially F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem swim in the dip, making it incredibly filling
the F_FoodItem pesto F_FoodItem is way too good as well
thick cuts of salty F_FoodItem, dripping F_FoodItem, generously spread pesto and perfectly F_FI_CookingLevel crust
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem is amazing! what a unique idea
i love the quirky, well balanced S_Menu
Restaurant is something to fit most moods and cravings
i need to come in for Food and brunch to see what the day time experience is like, but i'm sure i won't be disappointed
this Restaurant is in the popular section of old montreal
we had our first monsieur croquette - who knew a F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem could be so F_FI_Taste
we also had the F_FoodItem which was O_Experience
the Service was good and S_Stf_Behavior
the best part is the A_LocatedArea and the A_OutsideView from the A_Plc_Patio for people watching
we love this F_FoodItem place! they have the best F_FoodItem F_FoodItem in town and great Offers W_Price and selection
try the las vegas F_FoodItem-- so good!

absolutely amazing!!! we were 3 guys
i went with 2 other guys and they are both real foodies
we all said that it might have been top 3 Food of all time
no one had anything slightly bad to say
we S_Delivery like champions
we shared 4 F_Appetizer, 2 F_FoodItem, and 2 F_Dessert
the F_FoodItem was impeccable! duck in a can was an O_Experience and it was well W_Price it
it is really a Service to dine at a Restaurant like pdc
very impressive
we sat at the A_Plc_Bar overlooking the F_FI_CookingLevel prepare every Food
it was a great experience being in the thick of it and seeing them work so cohesively - when it came to our Food we appreciated it even more!the F_FoodItem was excellent
my only complaint would have been to have had more F_FoodItem, but i guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing! we had considered getting a F_FoodItem Food (given the Restaurant name involves a pig) but decided to go for duck in a can
its unique and F_FI_Taste
would recommend going here if you are in montreal, but make a O_Reservation!

farmer boys is ok for a change
nothing spectacular here, just good Food, good W_Price
i do find that they slop too much F_Ingredients on the F_FoodItem
not one of the top F_FoodItem places in vegas
i don't know why i was so reluctant to dine at the nordstrom Restaurant at first; time after time, the F_FI_Quality of the Food proves to be F_FI_Quality to other local offerings, regardless of the particular nordstrom location
in this case, we were at the fashion show mall, and i opted for the cranberry F_FoodItem on the advice of the S_Staff
my wife got the blackened F_FoodItem on a F_FoodItem
both were excellent, and the Service as always was friendly and S_Stf_Behavior
the only thing i would point out is that the room temperature always seems to lean a bit towards the polar ice caps side of the thermometer
for me, this is a plus, but be warned if you are one of those people who likes a Ambience room
Restaurant's not much else to say that hasn't already been said
behold, the £2
00 sub!serving up a lovely variety of scrummy fillings, all good lives up to its good name by delivering excellent Service, delicious, soft filled F_FoodItem and the £2 sub deal that has successfully bowled me over
even during Food hour you will experience speedy Service from S_Stf_Behavior S_Staff, and plenty to choose from off their up-to-date S_Menu
their website is pretty straightforward to navigate - fun and modern while also giving you some insight into the lunchtime S_Menu
great if you're nipping in on your Food hour or have a busy day of shopping ahead of you, all good is really good at spoiling us!

everything is bad but the $2 miller lites

black dog has the best F_FoodItem in the champaign/urbana area hands down
now all they need is a larger A_Places to serve it in, i love the A_Plc_Bar setting, but not one that has outgrown its A_Places because of how good their product is
waits are common of up to 30 mins anytime you go
as for the Food, lets start with the F_FoodItem F_Appetizer, F_FI_Taste F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem and the kick of the carolina F_FoodItem F_Ingredients puts them over the top
my wife can't stop talking about how good the burnt ends are, and she must not be the only one because the sell out frequently
loved the F_FoodItem, just wish they had some baby backs to choose from
all in all you will not beat this place for F_FoodItem anywhere within a hundred miles!

Food is P_F_FI_Taste/tasty and a good value
don't let the name fool you, not everything on the S_Menu is greasy
wish they had a little more indoor A_Fur_Table so one could avoid the flies and the heat, but i guess that is part of the Restaurant's character
awesome pho here
i usually get the #7 (F_FoodItem F_FoodItem with fresh F_FoodItem
)  although the F_FoodItem pho is pretty good too
honestly, i have not been disappointed an anything i've had from Restaurant
the thai iF_FI_CookingLevel F_Drinks is really good, too
when you first walk in to the place, you may think twice - it is an old F_FoodItem bell converted to vietnamese Restaurant
but don't let that stop you - the Food is excellent
i've gotten a lot of people hooked on the place - even people who are picky eaters and won't try anything "non-american
"

my wife brought me here for Food on a sunday
the F_FoodItem was awesome
i believe this is one a a few different locations for archies
i'll be back
and i'll probably have the pastrami again (that's how i F_FoodItem)
time flies when you're having fun
it's been almost a full year since my initial review of F_Ingredients, and i've been back probably ten times or more
i've seen a lot of transition with the S_Staff but i can say that their Service has gotten much better since the beginning
the casual Ambience is right up my alley for a weekend Food, and my yogi F_FoodItem / protein F_FoodItem S_Delivery have stayed consistent too
i was Restaurant earlier today and while the Service was spot-on, i did find a piece of F_FoodItem in my otherwise F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem - but i overlooked it and enjoyed my Food nonetheless
my husband has been to F_Ingredients even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled what's to come on their new Food S_Menu (think pastrami F_FoodItem)
so, go for Food, go for Food, go for a bloody mary or a mimosa
just kick back and enjoy your Food!

i love their F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar here! even though they serve cold dolma it is still pretty F_FI_Taste
i also like their F_FoodItem here with some artichokes
the W_Price is about $6
00 a pound but it is very filling and healthy
this is a perfect place to eat for someone who is broke but would still like to have a nutritious Food
this area is severely lacking in sit down Restaurant choices, so this was nice to see a sit down place going into the old nicks 24/7, especially because it seems to have taken them 1200 years to get this place open
i had actually thought they had pulled out it took so long
the S_Menu here is F_FI_Size
the F_FoodItem are yum
the F_FoodItem are nice
they have this italian F_FoodItem which is absolutely divine!  i just wish the F_FoodItem had more side choices
you get a bland F_FoodItem F_FoodItem at Food or F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem F_FoodItem at dinner which are nice when fresh, but if left too long before hitting the A_Fur_Table they are cold and floppy
i have found the F_FoodItem to be hit and miss
their tiramisu is totally P_F_FI_Taste/delish!  and anyone that knows me knows, that if the tiramisu doesn't impress i am hard pressed to come back
the Service here sways between S_Stf_Behavior or absent, guess its just the luck of the draw
the W_Price are right, and if you sign up for their monthly newsletter you get some pretty nice bargains
after arriving in vegas off of an early morning flight, we wanted to find a place to grab some quick Food and where we could enjoy the beautifully hot and sunny weather
we headed out from our hotel, aria, and cabo wabo's A_Plc_Patio fit the bill
the second floor A_Plc_Patio provided nice A_OutsideView of the bellagio A_OutsideViewand the misters under the umbrellas were an added bonus!we started with some F_FoodItem and queso which came with two huge baskets of corn F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was ok, the F_FoodItem was really runny, and the F_FoodItem were in F_FI_Size pieces which make dipping a challenge
for mains, between us we had the baja F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, the jalapeno F_FoodItem, and the southwest cobb F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was a bit F_FI_CookingLevel and dry, but the overall F_FI_Taste was good and P_F_FI_Taste/spicy
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem featured F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem which was also a bit try, and they definitely weren't the best i'd ever had
the F_FoodItem looked great, and was a huge A_Places
Restaurant definitely wasn't any Food that would be W_Price returning for
the W_Price were a bit expensive for what we got, particularly the $15 F_Dessert mama F_Drinks that was not that tasty
the S_Staff was S_Stf_Behavior, but was well versed in upselling, however not in a pushy way
i wouldn't return, Restaurant are other Restaurant in vegas with equally decent A_Plc_Patio that i would try first
really good F_FI_Size level
awesome F_FoodItem plates
pretty mundane po'boys
overly charred F_FoodItem
incredible F_FoodItem F_Appetizer
cramped indoor A_Fur_Table but still good eats
don't go here if you're vegetarian
Food were excellent!  softshell po boy, F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem, all wonderful!F_Dessert were good - the F_FoodItem were great!friday night Restaurant was A_Ent_Music on the A_Plc_Patio - it was loud but very A_Environment
i'm very picky when it comes to F_FoodItem, but one thing i will say it's their F_FoodItem is tasty, i S_Delivery delivery to my hotel room and they were right W_Waiting
i had their  original crust F_FoodItem they were cut in squares no biggie, the F_FoodItem wasn't greasy their a little more W_Price than F_FoodItem like F_FoodItem hut but it was all W_Price it
you get what you O_Payment for
met a friend here for Food and we were both well O_Experience
Service was good and fast, so fast they also cleared my chai before i was done drinking it!F_FoodItem was perfectly F_FI_CookingLevel and well seasoned
though you'd expect nothing less from this italian 'chain'
i've been to la favourita a few times, but this was my first visit to vittoria and i wouldn't hesitate to return
W_Price are reasonable for center of town and A_Places weren't too bad, tho it was definitely a 2 course Food
think i would have left slightly hungry if i hadn't had F_Dessert
okay so i have been to the location in hawaii and was happy to know that on my visits here in vegas i can now satisfy my tastebuds again with more of "thelmas special"(crunchy luau style F_FoodItem in thelmas F_Ingredients)
this place has something for everyone
it combines a great value on their Food and even better is served up by some of the S_Stf_Behavior S_Staff who really make you feel O_Experience! give em' a try!!!

went to the auld hoose with a group of yelpers in search of F_FoodItem
well, it wasn't much of a search, we had previously been informed that this place has the biggest F_FoodItem ever - seriously see the A_Decor!!  so i came armed with a hunger to match
3 of us shared a bowl of these F_FoodItem that are suggested for 3-4
they came pretty quickly and looked amazing when they did
great ratio of toppings to nachos, as so often Restaurant is just not enough
F_FI_Taste F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients and F_FoodItem throughout
it took us a good 20 minutes or so to make a serious dent in the mound and start to get to the underneath layers, which were still hot
after eating about a quarter of the bowl myself, i really should have stopped, but as i hate wasting Food and the other 2 had had enough, i just kept shovelling it in
literally
using the nachos to shovel up the toppings
big mistake
when i finally finished all the toppings, apart from some jalapeños which are a little on the spicy side for my mild palate, Restaurant was a only a handful of nachos left
about 15 minutes later, when i got up to use the A_Plc_Bathroom, i realised just how full i was - serious F_FoodItem top and struggled to do my pants back up
walking home was not at all comfortable, more of a waddle
then i seriously needed to lie down and stretch out
i don't hesitate to say that these are the best nachos i've ever had
i just wish we had a 4th person to help us eat the monstrosity
as for the pub; it is quite small, but with character
laid back S_Staff, heavy A_Ent_Music playing in the background, not your usual pub A_Ent_Music
would definitely go back for the nachos alone, but i might give it a while!

great selection
F_FoodItem is excellent
if i could give 0 stars, i would
i used to visit the paradise location until it closed due to salmonella
i figured this westside location would be fine
my coworker and i went last night for dinner
the Service was absolutely terrible considering they were about a quarter full, but we dealt with it
soon after we got home we were both experiencing terrible abdominal pains, followed by throwing up every F_Appetizer we ate
this went on for a few hours
double Food poisoning? disgusting
they need to revamp their entire business
A_Plc_Kitchen, S_Staff, Service
firefly is headed down a bad road
this is my favorite Food in vegas
i used to frequent the rio and m F_FoodItem for years, but ever since i tried this place, i'm never going back
some of the Food is served individually in small pots or Food which is nice since i have no portion control
all of the Food i tried that had starchy F_FoodItem were good
(i
the leek F_FoodItem F_Appetizer!!!! this was ridiculous and the risotto) only gripe was that the prime rib was over-F_FI_CookingLevel by my standards
the F_Dessert A_Plc_Bar was murder
i think i ate like 40 chocolate covered F_FoodItem
i swear they sprinkled a little bit of crack into each one
they had oreo-covered F_Desserts, F_FoodItem F_Dessert, and a bunch of little things of which i had no idea their names or what they consisted of
but most of it was pretty darn good
i can't wait to go back in a couple weeks and go to town on their Food
this place was recommended by a friend when i moved to las vegas
the Food is consistent, and everyone i have brought here loves it!

F_Drinks locally F_FI_CookingLevel F_Drinks
loved the F_FI_CookingLevel F_Drinks growler over the summer
just the basics, but tasty
very disappointed-went in just minutes before closing time
was just getting a "quick" sub & F_Drinks to go
Restaurant was 1 other customer in shop
i parked in handicap S_Parking spot right in front
made my S_Delivery filled my F_Drinks
had a A_Fur_Table to wait for my sub (*because of my handicap) "shift mgr
graham" had stepped out to give that other customer something that was accidentally left out of his S_Delivery
as graham came back in he says "just so you know,  we're closed" then gave me an awkward look
then walked away
& i know he knew that i was dumbfounded by his comment because he kept awkwardly looking over at me - i hadn't even received my Food- how did he know if i was or wasn't planning to eat in shop or leave
or was that just his way of saying get out
???  well when i did receive my Food i had asked for his name so i could call back the next day to speak to management
graham had the S_Staff that who gave me his name, & he wasn't aware that is good friend text my son to "apologize if he sounded disrespectful" not even 5 minutes after i left the shop
seems to me that graham was rethinking the way he was speaking to customers
ya think???

fabulous Food!!!!!  great location!!!  fabulous customer Service!!!!  the Food was great will go again!!!  have already told at least 10 other people to go try it out!!!  fun little spot!!!!  make sure to make O_Reservation as they get very busy!!!  the people working Restaurant where so helpful & kind & all had a beautiful smile!!!  can't wait to go again!!!

superb Service, excellent deer F_FoodItem, tasty and rich F_FoodItem F_FI_CookingLevel perfectly
very satisfied Food
i was going to be generous and give three stars but then i tried the peach cobbler
when i walked up to the podium to place my S_Delivery i asked if i could sample their F_FoodItem F_Ingredients
the man said he would bring out the house F_FoodItem F_Ingredients and some type of sweet F_FoodItem F_Ingredients
i did not like either F_Ingredients and this should have been an inclination of what was to come
i S_Delivery the two F_FoodItem plate with pulled F_FoodItem and pulled F_FoodItem and for my side i chose the baked F_FoodItem
10 minutes later my Food was ready
first, i tried the pulled F_FoodItem and the pulled F_FoodItem and both were less then impressive
i used some F_FoodItem F_Ingredients that i had at home to spruce up the F_FoodItem
next, i tried the baked F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem were good, i liked the chunks of F_FoodItem and i think their house F_FoodItem F_Ingredients F_FI_Taste better when it is F_FI_CookingLevel into something
lastly, the peach cobbler was inedible
i took one F_Appetizer and that was it, all i could F_FI_Taste was nutmeg
still in search of good F_FoodItem in las vegas and that includes the sides as well
super W_Price F_FoodItem tuesdays and thursdays
i had always preferred traditional F_FoodItem (tuesday) over boneless F_FoodItem (thursday)
personally the boneless F_FoodItem somehow do not feel like i'm having F_FoodItem
despite being easier to eat, i would like my F_FoodItem experience to be messy, but that is just me =)i have tried a huge variety from the non spicy sweet F_FoodItem  to the extremely spicy wild
some favorites are F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, honey F_FoodItem, asian zing and mango habanero
the F_FoodItem tuesdays is the only reason for showing up
it's a great way to get W_Price Food
i've been wanting to try this place but since the other ramen place had overly salty broth the last two times, i got turned off eating ramen all together
Restaurant was a odd day of constant rain and cool temps in this blister which needed to be celebrated with some soup
made for a perfect excuse to have something warming
i grabbed up a miso ramen and the bf went for spicy ramen and on the recommendation of the S_Staff for a "lighter" broth got shoyu base
the F_FoodItem was F_FI_Taste and F_FI_CookingLevel (has some oil floaties, but enough to be a deterrent) and not overtly salty
i really like that it comes with a soft boiled soy F_FoodItem, the thicker rustic F_FI_CookingLevel style cut of chashu was F_FI_CookingLevel and the ramen was rightfully chewy
this is a bit different from the traditional sapporo toppings i'm used to as it normally has corn, F_FoodItem sprouts, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
i suppose i could add those toppings next time
i took a F_FI_Taste of the bfs shoyu spicy broth and it was fairly good
still a bit porky, but much lighter since it isn't creamy like the miso and the spicy crept up to a F_FI_Size F_FI_CookingLevel
we got a mini chashu bowl to share
it was much smokier than the chashu in the soup so it seems they throw it on the grill before serving and top with a drizzle of sweet soy so it's a different experience
i like this preparation
i wish they offer some F_Ingredients as a side condiment as the little bit of acid would be nice with the sweet
we came within the last hour of being open so i figured that's why Service is quick, but hope that it F_Appetizer comes out that fast regularly
our S_Staff was friendly and didn't make us feel rushed
i definitely prefer this over the other ramen place
somehow my bf got it in his head he doesn't like ramen so even though i like it, it may be a trek i make again alone
i can't say enough good things about postino
as far as locations go, i think gilbert has the best Food overall followed by postino arcadia and then postino central, but i would give all of them 5 stars except postino central which i gave 4 (due to freshness of F_Ingredients)
if this is your first time trying postino, you must try the F_FoodItem
it is out of this world
i've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy postino's F_FoodItem, but it is never as good
aside from the F_FoodItem, the F_FoodItem are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic
most importantly, the F_Drinks is amazing at postino
if you are not sure which to try, always try the postino exclusive
it will never let you down
all the locations except for gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is S_Stf_Behavior also
even better, on mondays and tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of F_Drinks and a tray of F_FoodItem! it cannot be beat!!

hands down, the best sisig we've F_FI_Taste in the us
Service sucked though
took a really long S_Del_Time for us to be A_Fur_Table (although Restaurant were a few empty A_Fur_Table), S_Staff took an even longer S_Del_Time to come back to get our S_Delivery and we were already halfway done with our Food when the sisig came out
the A_Fur_Table beside us who came in later than us got their sisig way ahead of us so maybe they forgot our S_Delivery
good thing the sisig was W_Price the wait! will definitely go back for that
i'll keep it simple
this place sits right under five S_Staff and in-n-out on my list of favorite fast (fresh) Food F_FoodItem joints
it's a great F_FoodItem, very fresh
but you don't have as many options and the fries don't even compare to five S_Staff
i got the F_FoodItem and swiss char
that's basically the extent of their F_FoodItem options
and i thoroughly enjoyed it! but the whole time i was thinking i wish this F_FoodItem had F_Ingredients and fresh jalapenos on it!!nice place, but given the choice i'm going across the street
normally i don't give 2 star's but i am going to give this over hyped Food one for the first time being that i'm a Food lover and have experience in tons of them to compare to
first off this is as i seen one if not the most expensive Food's in town right now with myself O_Payment $48 to get in even with a player's card
2nd off i have no clue how they got 500 Food out of the mixture Restaurant is no way by far 500 Food in this Food Restaurant is the same amount of selection from stateion to station as any other typical big Food in vegas maybe Restaurant trying to hype up the fact you can customize a Food up to 500 ways but either way i'm not buying it because i was expecting to see once again the king of Food's here!let's say the F_FI_Quality was very poor, the F_FoodItem in some Food F_FI_Taste like F_FoodItem in a bag, the italian Food was very bland nothing interesting or unique especially the F_FoodItem balls F_FI_Taste like F_FI_CookingLevel freezer selection
they didn't even serve F_FoodItem so i had to settle on F_FoodItem chops also that were very W_Price in F_FI_Quality
just the list goes on and on of just miss after miss of trying to hit the spot on F_FI_Quality and selection
the only positive thing i can say about this place is that my greeter was very nice and gave me a quick tour of the place and the S_Staff was a very nice gentleman which i tipped him accordingly but other then that i'll never return
hole in the A_Decor but the Food is very good
awesome place my husband and i love it
S_Staff is really friendly and the Food is great
absolutely love this place!!! so pleased that it arrived in the surprise area! this location has great S_Staff and Service and if they ever do make a mistake (which has happened only once in the 100+ times i've been Restaurant) they are very quick to make sure that you are S_Stf_Behavior and properly taken care of! love me some freddy's!

had early friday night pre-theater dinner here
once we got a S_Staff's attention the Service was very good
S_Stf_Behavior with good suggestions but not intrusive
casual open A_Env_AC atmosphere, causal but lively ambience, perfect for dinner with friends
my wife & her friend enjoyed a "prickly pear F_Drinks" not too sweet veryP_F_FI_Taste/_tasty!  excellent Food overall F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were fresh
guac was tasty & paired well with the F_FoodItem
we had 3 Food perfect for sharing
mexican street corn nicely spiced a bit messy but W_Price it
nice fresh updated take on classic fare
will certainly go back!

this place is the best F_FoodItem in town and chu is hella cutie
ron is great and all the F_FoodItem S_Staff are awesome F_Ingredients
i try to come all the time

we were excited to have a F_FoodItem joint in the area - but unfortunately we will not be F_FI_Size here
the S_Staff is extremely friendly - opening the door as we walked in and a S_Staff taking our F_Drinks S_Delivery immediately - but the S_Staff cannot make up for the sub par Food
we had F_FoodItem F_FoodItem that was F_FI_CookingLevel - followed by my husbands F_FoodItem F_FoodItem that to me looked canned - and he said did not F_FI_Taste much better - not to mention the double corn tortillas could not even stay together
move on to my F_FI_CookingLevel mahi F_FoodItem that somehow was extreme greasy
i also had a side of plantains that were more like burnt sautéed bananas than plantains - though my husbands F_Appetizer were good
so we may be back for a F_FoodItem - but not Food
oh and one last note - the A_Decor are very beachish - but the music was not - it should have been old beach music - beach boys, steel drums, bob marley etc
this is a review from a wine lover
went here for a bday party and this place does not serve F_Drinks / F_Drinks, only a few F_Drinks
just writing this as an fyi to anyone expecting a variety of F_Drinks choices
not a F_Drinks person
? go somewhere else
oh man, first of all i am soooo happy Restaurant is finally a place like this in the east valley
second, it's amazing! the Ambience is super cute and O_Experience, the S_Staff is friendly and helpful, and the Food
holy F_FoodItem, yum! so far, the F_FoodItem duo and the F_FoodItem are both incredible
i'll definitely be back to try more since pretty much everything on the S_Menu sounds F_FI_Taste
oh and if you like peanut F_Ingredients & jelly they have an awesome F_FoodItem!

F_FI_CookingLevel F_FoodItem is where it's at! love these F_FoodItem
i've tried them all

3
5 stars for Food
i really enjoyed the F_FoodItem it was very flavorful
the dolmades was good too
it has the right acidity on it
the F_FoodItem, however, was dry and lacking F_FI_Taste
the F_FoodItem feta fries lacks F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste and it F_FI_Taste like an old refried fries
if it's not then it was way F_FI_CookingLevel
O_Exp_StarsByCus for the W_Price: we O_Payment $26
10 for 2 combo F_FoodItem wrap with one side each
fyi their combo doesn't come with F_Drinks
you would assume for the W_Price it does
i'm so rarely on the early end of a trendy Restaurant that i feel pretty cool having visited the summit room just a month after they opened! it looks totally different than when it was bruegger's - i can't speak to the mayobird side, but i definitely felt like i was in a casual, trendy Restaurant
a girlfriend and i went after work and got Restaurant right at 5:00 when they opened
we were only the second people A_Environment, and we grabbed a A_Fur_Table at the A_Plc_Bar
the A_Plc_Bar itself is awfully pretty
glass bottles as far as the eye can see and silver A_Plc_Bar A_Furniture lend themselves to a very clean, modern feel without being sterile
Restaurant were maybe 12-14 A_Fur_Table at the A_Plc_Bar, a few A_Fur_Table along the side, and a high, long A_Fur_Table at the front near the front door
Restaurant's also a huge, inviting A_Plc_Patio, but it was a little sweltering the night we were Restaurant
i also love the huge, private S_Parking lot, which is a little rare on east blvd
our S_Staff, scott, was so fun and gave us honest recommendations on what to get
i think he got a little overwhelmed later in the evening, but i'm guessing they're just getting their footing
we opted to split the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem flat F_FoodItem F_Appetizer
the F_FoodItem flat F_FoodItem came in four pieces, which were F_FI_Taste if just a smidgen dry, and the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was pretty F_FI_Taste, too
it came over a corn pudding, which F_FI_Taste verrrry corny, so buyer beware
we were also given complimentary cheddar scones before dinner, which F_FI_Taste like the delicious red F_FoodItem cheddar bay biscuits, only in A_Decor scone form
mmmmm
we each got a signature F_FoodItem; Restaurant are 7, and they're named after the tallest summit on each continent
the mount vinson was very smooth - cinnamon, ginger F_Drinks, vanilla - and the kilimanjaro was refreshing and sweet for summer - F_Drinks, cranberry, gin
when we left, we noticed that the A_Plc_Patio was packed! this is a great "A_Environment" addition to a casual row of Restaurant on east blvd
do yourself a favor, and check out the summit room
nice new chain all u can eat F_FoodItem place of F_FoodItem tokyo,Service are fast and friendly,Food are almost fresh and tasty,especially the raw F_FoodItem sashimi which was sweet and yummy!one downside is the mussel Food we had last night were not so fresh
the A_Decor Restaurant is cool, i like the fancy chandelier ,maybe that's the reason it's a little pricey for a ayce F_FoodItem place
i accidentally scheduled a reservation at lavecchia during Restaurant week, which frankly could have been a recipe for disaster
as i'm new to A_LocatedArea, i wound up looking for Restaurant at the old location
the S_Staff, sweetheart that S_Staff was, told me she'd meet me in the lobby of the new A_LocatedArea to make sure we found it
i'm sure the comments previous to mine related to Service are valid
however, that was not the case for me
we got two differing copies of the Restaurant week S_Menu, and our S_Staff merely looked at them briefly before telling us to S_Delivery whatever we'd like off of either and she'd handle it
Restaurant were also out of the F_Drinks we S_Delivery, and she brought us a better bottle and charged us the less expensive F_FI_Price
S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive but not intrusive throughout and more or less fell all over herself to make sure we knew how much S_Staff appreciated we were understanding of the "mistakes"
it's rare for a S_Staff to go so above and beyond to make sure i'm happy
the Food- decent for upscale
i had F_FoodItem (average) and a F_FoodItem that was cooked exactly like a medium-rare F_FoodItem should be
my dining partner had F_FoodItem, and i will not judge a Restaurant based on the presentation of that boring ass F_FoodItem
it F_FI_Taste like F_FoodItem and an appealing F_FoodItem
the Service along merited a return trip
i'm looking forward to seeing if the F_FoodItem F_FI_Quality
i love F_FoodItem, and i love the F_FoodItem Restaurant
F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem are a beautiful combination atop the thin crust, F_Ingredients, and F_Ingredients
all the F_FoodItem are excellent actually, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem too
it's not five O_Exp_StarsByCus because i just don't think they were going for that sort of thing, it certainly won't break your A_Places with under F_FI_Price7 Food specials and average F_FI_Price F_FoodItem
possibly better than actual new york F_FoodItem, but i'll leave that up for debate
i used to like their Foodhonestly
it was my one year anniversary
me and me man went Restaurant to celebratei had a F_FoodItem tailand a fileton the way home, i got violently illlike, within ten minutes of leaving Restaurant
and no, i only had a few glasses of F_Drinks :)i ended up going home, and laying on the A_Places for awhile crying, moaning, vomiting, etcafter about an hour, i couldn't take it anymorei called 911the paramedics showed up, i was naked and crying on the A_Places
it was a very romantic anniversary, let me tell you
after a long night at scottsdale osborn hospital, it was determined that the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/undercooked/tainted and made me severly ill
i'll never eat Restaurant again
simply because i've never been so sick
it's a shame though, because on the way down, the F_FoodItem had these cajun seasonings and really was exceptionally P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
howeveri contacted ruths chris and they refunded my Food amount, O_Payment my hospital copay, and were sooo nice and accomodating to my every demand
bravo
although, boo for almost killing me
eh, i'm torn
i have lived Restaurant since 1984 and Restaurant was the first place i ever ate in A_Places as a 5 year old
i keep coming back for more over and over again
i crave it constantly! i get the simple F_FoodItem F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and it's super hot on a hot S_Cutlery every time and still F_FI_Taste the same after all these years
best F_FoodItem/F_FoodItem you will every have as well
massive F_Drinks is always a bonus
not giving it 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus due to the inside not have been touched in probably 30 years
needs to be updated a tad, but other than that
Food wise, it's my favorite mexican Food in az
:)
i chose to have a happy hour F_Appetizer Restaurant a couple of days ago
it had been a while since i was a patron Restaurant, and some F_FoodItem sounded amazing at the time
and, as always, the hummus (all 3) was excellent
i opted to sit on the A_Plc_Patio overlooking the lake that sits just across a small patch of grass and a concrete pathway
"how did this pond get Restaurant?" i thought for just a moment
then decided i didn't care because my black F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was being brought out to me
the Service is almost always amazing
the guest ducks, unfortunately, have been trained by those with lesser wills to beg A_Fur_Table-side for some scraps from your S_Cutlery, and subsequently F_FoodItem all over the dining area A_Places
all i hear from the white duck is 'quack quack!', which i assume in duckinese means 'more hummus', but i can't be too sure
i don't even know spanish
other than the pandering ducks, my O_Experience Restaurant was very good again
looking forward to the next visit!
this is a perennial favorite of my husband and i
we love the A_Environment, the Food, F_Drinks and juicy slabs of F_FoodItem we can choose from
their A_Plc_Patio also has a nice vibe to it when the weather cools off some, the fireplace prevents things from getting too chilly during our short fall and winter seasons
my favorite has always been the prime F_FoodItem, medium rare almost to the outer edges with a generous helping of horseradish and au jus
i also can't eat Restaurant without the F_FoodItem neptune
we each get an S_Delivery to avoid sharing
i love liberty market
i grew up in gilbert and remember when this was a small A_LocatedArea
i've been wanting to check this place out since the conversion and i'm so glad i finally stopped by
Restaurant was perfect
Restaurant just feels like home
casual, but warm
when we walked in my friend and i were lost and didn't know where to start
luckily one of the S_Staff quickly handed us S_Menu and told us where to S_Delivery
i had a couple of F_Ingredients F_FoodItem and the F_FoodItem
i loved both
the F_FoodItem came with 4 P_F_FI_Size/big F_FoodItem in marinara F_Ingredients and and two slices of P_F_FI_CookingLevel/toasted F_FoodItem
it was so hard narrowing down my S_Menu because Restaurant were so many P_F_FI_Taste/delicious looking Food on the S_Menu and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but i resisted
next time i think i'll just give in and have a slice of red velvet or F_Ingredients F_FoodItem, or a cup F_FoodItem or a slice of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem or a sticky F_FoodItem
so much to choose from
i would love to come back Restaurant and have a F_Drinks and sit and enjoy the atmosphere at the espresso A_Plc_Bar
loved all the different A_Decor in the A_Plc_Bathroom stalls
you have to check each one out
joe was Restaurant and stopped by each A_Fur_Table to see how everyone was doing
we spent so much time Restaurant chatting and catching up
it's a great place to come and hang out
i will P_O_Experience/be_back soon
what a breath of fresh A_Env_AC! finally, a market concept done right! awesome branding, excellent design, P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff
i felt so at home! the Food was amazing: fresh deli F_FoodItem, cranberry, brie with a A_Decor tang of F_FoodItem
and the sweet F_Ingredients F_FoodItem was a great new try
i love how every detail was addressed: well, but not oversized F_Drinks mugs, great china, even the F_Drinks station had the perfect set of utensils for my self-Service F_Drinks
one F_FoodItem would be Food
it ends at 11a on weekdays and 1p on weekends
as an avid Food all-day advocate, this P_O_Experience/disappoints me
think about extending those S_Del_Time! lgo did it with great success
overall, huge fan
if you haven't gone, check it out!!
lali j
and i took a A_OutsideView trip to tokyo lobby last night
we'd heard about it through excellent reviews in the new S_Del_Time and the republic (a positive review in the republic is often a neon sign that says "stay away," but we decided to risk it)
as a transplanted new yorker/san franciscan/los angeleno, i have to say tokyo lobby has been my favorite F_FoodItem O_Experience in the valley
if you're used to ra or any of the other mcsushi A_Places, it's worth the schlep up to north glendale (which is almost as far as the yukon from where we live) to check this place out
is a small, 10 A_Fur_Table joint, but it's crowded in a vibrant, fun way
Service is fast and friendly
it's in a strip mall, but if you keep your eyes left of center as you approach from the S_Parking lot, you won't see the walmart on your right
the usual/F_FI_Religious suspects are brilliant -- stunning unagi, maguro, tobiko, etc
the sides and F_Appetizer were fab, too: great seaweed F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem tokyo lobby is creative with the specialty F_FoodItem -- the marilyn mon-F_FoodItem (not kidding) was terrific: a P_F_FI_Taste/spicy F_FoodItem F_FoodItem wrapped in albacore with an elegant F_Ingredients of crispy/crunchy F_FoodItem
Restaurant's also a full S_Menu of earthbound F_Ingredients and assorted other goodies
everything looked great
really -- check this place out!
the Service was excellent (maybe because i went when Restaurant weren't that many people Restaurant
the Food was amazing! i had the veal raviolli
it didn't F_FI_Taste gamey at all, and the F_Ingredients was amazing
i love this A_Places!
pros: great A_Environment
open 24/7
great phó
phone S_Delivery easy to go
the red been F_Dessert is awesome! over all good F_FI_Prices
cons: hit or miss with the S_Staff
sometimes i feel rushed
last week - i dropped by the aloha A_Plc_Kitchen and A_Plc_Bar for Food
had high hopes that this would be a A_LocatedArea that would come S_OpenHours to being like the Food i love and miss when i'm back home on the islands
however - i've learned to live with P_O_Experience/disappointment in life and my visit Restaurant was just another added to that list
the A_Plc_DiningRoom is nice - somewhat clean, open and modern(ish) compared to other "local" style Restaurant i've been to
the names of the Food were promising and the F_FI_Price seemed in line with the portion F_FI_Size i had seen on people's A_Fur_Table as i S_Del_Time to place my S_Delivery
i was coming down with a cold so i wanted saimin - even with it being in the 90's and humid which they don't S_Staff
a Food style Restaurant that doesn't S_Staff saimin - odd
even fast food joints in hawaii S_Staff saimin
at least they S_Staff P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem
so, i settled for that
too much F_FoodItem which normally isn't a bad thing however, after a few F_Appetizer, i started to separate the F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients
sorted thru and picked out the minced F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem and with the leftover F_FoodItem, it looked like i hadn't made a dent in the S_Cutlery
i also chose a side of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
ugh
all i'm going to say is that i have to wonder if the S_Staff have ever been to the islands
either that or the S_Staff have started tayloring their Food to the F_FI_Taste of people who haven't been either
or maybe, i didn't choose the right Food that they specialize in
whatever the case, i didn't like what i S_Delivery and i doubt i'll be back any S_Del_Time soon
i love this place
it's easily one of my favorite Restaurant in A_LocatedArea
the Ambience is great - this is a beautiful Restaurant
it's a very intimate A_Environment and is a great Ambience for a romantic date night
but it still manages to maintain a simplistic charm
the Food is absolutely P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
i usually get the F_FoodItem, and P_O_Experience/recommend it wholeheartedly
the F_Drinks list is extensive and the Service is wonderful
no complaints
went during Food over the weekend, and it was easily one of the very best indian F_FoodItem i've had a chance to eat at
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem Food was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, as were all of the vegetarian options Restaurant
whereas it doesn't seem a major thing, the condiment A_Plc_Bar; F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, etc, was one of the most complete i've seen
will head Restaurant again
the discovery of this place in 2004 forever changed my tastebuds
since it's S_OpenHours now, i can finally review based on the Restaurant when it first opened and i fell in love with it, and not after the shady change in business S_Staff where i boycotted the last year or so anyway
$5 for delicious S_Cutlery of dumplings, either F_FoodItem or F_Ingredients, either F_Ingredients or spicy
i always got spicy half and half (half F_Ingredients, half F_FoodItem), never with sour cream tho cuz i don't like the stuff
just 1 extra dollar for a F_Drinks and it was among the cheapest, most filling dinners in town
as a campus "safewalker," i stopped Restaurant nearly every night i worked for my dinner
before they S_OpenHours, i bought up several S_Delivery for freezing (which they let you do), and rationed them out for months after their S_OpenHours
they let me in on the secret for the spicy F_Ingredients
~F_Ingredients~a little F_FoodItem F_Drinks vinegar~cilantro~curry powder~srirachatop that with a piece of pumpernickel, and you have nothing short of pure magic
5 years later i still have dreams about Restaurant, and once even tried requesting a pel meni mold for my birthday (still S_Del_Time on one of those - hint hint people)!when i moved to boston, i was thrilled to find a russian grocery store that had P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen F_FoodItem
tho i have tried both their packaged and their home-made S_Menu, nothing has come S_OpenHours to the madison gem
original pel meni genious  - if you're reading, please please come to boston!  i will eat Food at your store and bring throngs to this mecca - just please make this dream a reality!  i suppose i'd settle on just learning your pel meni recipe if nothing else
went Restaurant for brunch yesterday (sat)
two words, stay away!yes, the S_Staff look P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
but if its good indian Food you're looking for, Restaurant is a big let down
the brunch S_Menu was sparse, most Food F_Drinks down (F_FI_Taste nothing like they should), Food didn't F_FI_Taste P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh & to make it worse - my glass of F_Drinks had stuff floating in it
working in the capitol area for 15 years, la canasta capitolio is a must
Restaurant are very few places to eat near the capitol, but la canasta not only provides a place for a F_Appetizer to eat, but some good Food as well
i don't like F_FoodItem, so i generally stick to the red F_Ingredients F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, which is very good
F_FI_Price are reasonable, too
i think their hibernate business comes from the government workers in the A_LocatedArea, and lot's of police and fifi's (firefighters)
if the pd and fifi's eat Restaurant, it must be good
free F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem (very good F_FoodItem) is a definite plus! also, i've heard their Food F_FoodItem's are excellent
i was visiting arizona from new york & came Restaurant to celebrate my dear friends birthday
we also came to see another friend perform with his A_Ent_LiveShow
the Ambience is great
the S_Staff are all very P_S_Stf_Appearance/handsome S_Staff & really gorgeous "pin up" girl looking ladies
i am not a F_Drinks drinker
i love F_Drinks but i get the bubble guts when i F_Drinks it (yeah, i know tmi)
anyway, it was very intimidating to hear that we were going to a F_Drinks A_Plc_Bar
however, the S_Staff was super sweet & P_S_Stf_Behavior/accomadating
they actually recreated a F_Drinks for me called a "F_Drinks" that i had at blue wasabi which is my new favorite F_Drinks
of course, it wasn't exactly the same but it was still pretty good
i was really P_O_Experience/impressed with the fact that the S_Staff went out of S_Staff way to get me something that i could F_Drinks
S_Staff even stopped me at one point & said " i feel like you are not happy
i really want to make you happy"
that was so super sweet of S_Staff & i gave S_Staff a very good tip for all of S_Staff efforts
i didn't try the Food
the great S_Staff & S_Staff & live band are worth seeing
it ia a bit pricey so be prepared to spend some money
also, the A_OutsideView is in the back of the club so it is hard to find it
thank god my friend came out to get us
i will definitely be back in the future if time permits it
i am sitting Restaurant as i type this
my wife, her parents and i were visiting from out of town and decided to drop by an "Food deli" for Food
firstly this place is closer to a deli you'd find on new york rather than one in italy
in S_Del_OrderingMethod, i heard two people S_Delivery fettuccine alfredo for Food
so, Restaurant's our S_Delivery:  one F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (one if the few Food Food on the S_Menu),  one Food sausage F_FoodItem, one portobello F_FoodItem and one cheese panini
while i was S_Delivery,  the S_Staff ( the S_Staff) kept giving me an odd look
like "who do you think you S_Delivery Restaurant?"  i also got a F_Drinks which was on display
when i asked for it,  he didn't know what it was so i had to show him the bottle
also, the request to have a double espresso and F_Drinks made later seemed to give him and an associate all kinds of inconvenience
Restaurant's what we got:the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was good albeit a bit greasy
the Food F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was ok
the portobello F_FoodItem never arrived
instead we got another half of a F_FoodIteme F_FoodItem
when i told this to the S_Staff, he said "if you want portobello i'll make you one
"  no apologies no cares
when it finally came out, it was bad
the cheese panini (which had bacon in it!) was nasty
when i went to ask for a S_Cutlery,  the S_Staff said that they should be out by the F_Drinks machine
i informed him they were not
S_Staff screamed for 'ernesto to bring out the S_Cutlery" and told me "the should be out soon, i think"
also got first apology of the day
the F_Dessert was atrocious
it's beyond words how bad it is
really awful
seriously
finally,  to add injury to insult, we were overcharged 50c
this was explained as a computer error
we got the money back
will never return
a friend of our's found this place on yelp, saying it was the #2 O_Exp_StarsByCus Restaurant so we had to give it a try since it was close to where we live
it's in a strip mall and i would never have expected a Restaurant like this to exist Restaurant
the Ambience and A_Decor is nice
they have a pri fix S_Menu for $55 which includes 1 Food and 2 something else (F_Appetizer, F_FoodItem, or F_Dessert)
our favorite F_Appetizer was the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem ( they told us it was a signature Food)
the F_FoodItem was the favorite for the Food and for F_Dessert, the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_Appetizer F_FI_Taste exactly like a warm F_Ingredients joy
yumm, this place also gave out little extra F_Dessert at the end ( F_Ingredients F_Ingredients, peanut F_Ingredients balls, and lemon thing) that's a nice touch to end the Food
the Service was impeccable, almost better than any on the strip Restaurant
great Restaurant!
before eating at hikari, i have tried only two other all you can eat F_FoodItem joints
todai in honolulu, and midori F_FoodItem in los angeles
in a fight between the 3 i think hikari wins hands down
i had 4 pieces of F_FoodItem, 4 uni, 4 F_FoodItem, 2 F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, 2 F_FoodItem, 1 F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
it must have been a good catch they had come in because F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and melt in your mouth buttery
the F_FoodItem was really good too!with a ratio of 5 to 1 i think the S_Staff had a really good memory for the amount of orders he had to deal with too
i will definitely P_O_Experience/be_back when i go vegas again
i may even write another review; regardless of the fact that reminiscing of the Food creates so much hunger pain
i love this place! the bakery is in the front
but walk down the aisle on the side of the bakery and you will discover a Restaurant
a trattoria
sit down
relax
S_Delivery a F_FoodItem
a Food of F_FoodItem
or a S_Cutlery of F_Drinks to dip your biscotti in
everything mixes and matches in the back
ask for larry- the S_Staff!
the A_Environment was pretty nice when we first stepped in
they accommodated to our party of ten in a reasonable time
upon A_Fur_Table we S_Delivery our F_Drinks and a few bottles of $10 F_Drinks
the catch is that you have to S_Delivery $10 of Food in S_Delivery to take advantage of the deal
then the S_Del_Time began
the Food took what seemed like forever and a day, i was thinking about eating the F_FI_Size of lemon in my F_Drinks  to stave the hunger
however, when it finally came i was P_O_Experience/surprised at the portions of some of the Food
i S_Delivery F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and what came out did not resemble Food like a F_FoodItem
it was a bunch of F_Ingredients thrown onto a tortilla and that was it
i've had better attempts of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem at rubio's
this was a true testament that sometimes it's better to get F_FI_Quality then F_FI_Size
we had F_Dessert of s'mores and that was probably their only saving grace
although it's nothing more than your normal F_Ingredients, but the fact that they Service it Restaurant made the end a little more tolerable
well, if i recall correctly, Restaurant's three types of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, a few S_Menu of F_FoodItem, a few types of F_FoodItem  and a few F_Drinks on tap, but one bartendress that made us come back more than once
what friendly Service
:)also, i was eating too much F_FI_Price Food and needed to get back to earth and not be too addicted to vegas
the S_Staff looked like a trained A_Ent_LiveShow, i wished i remembered to ask her
which reminds me, Restaurant is a whole lot of trained theater A_Ent_LiveShow in vegas
five O_Exp_StarsByCus for that
3 and 1/2 O_Exp_StarsByCus
it's a build a F_FoodItem type Restaurant, named #2 F_FoodItem joint in las vegas
you pick your type of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem including kobe, sustainable, sirloin, etc and other including F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, etc
then you can pick your F_FoodItem - F_FoodItem, sesame, whole wheat, ciabatta, etc, F_FoodItem - pepperjack, swiss, american, cheddar, etc, and fixings:  F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, etc, F_Ingredients - F_Ingredients, shallot reduction, etc
some F_FoodItem are already built for you and you got your schmancy ones including a $60 F_Ingredients F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem/F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, etc
pick your side of fries:  skinny, F_FoodItem, sweet F_Ingredients
first S_Del_Time Restaurant i picked the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem which was pretty F_FI_Taste, but i don't remember too much about it
second S_Del_Time i S_Delivery a sustainable on wheat w/swiss F_FoodItem and shallot reduction
honestly, F_FoodItem didn't have much F_Ingredients, and the F_Ingredients didn't either so my F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste pretty A_Env_Size
good selection of F_Drinks and small A_Ent_Tv for each A_Fur_Table
while the F_FI_Price for a typical F_FoodItem isn't through the roof, (around $20) your best bet if you're pinching your wallet would be the slider F_Appetizer, three cute sliders w/fries for only $12
95
whether it's just for a couple F_Appetizer, a lite Food or for a full Food, mesa grill is always a great S_Menu
the S_Menu has a vast array of southwestern flavored Food and Restaurant should be something on the S_Menu for S_Staff
we have eaten Restaurant on several S_Del_Time and have yet to be P_O_Experience/disappointed
the Service is very attentive and professional and simply add to the enjoyment of your Food
the Restaurant is A_LocatedArea right in the heart of caesars palace, so its a great place to enjoy a Food and then go catch a A_Entertainment or enjoy some A_Entertainment
definitely Worthiness checking out
Restaurant week review i have to preface this review with, this is my first visit Restaurant and we came Restaurant specifically for Restaurant week, the Food S_Menu
original plan was to sit A_OutsideView on the nice terrace overlooking the bellagio A_Decor, but the weather prevented us from doing that, so the S_Staff sat us next to the A_Furniture, which was perfect
our S_Staff P_O_Experience/suggested 2 of his favorite F_FoodItem F_Drinks specialties from the A_Plc_Bar, i wish i could remember the names of them, they were so good
for my app i went with crispy F_Ingredients riblets; sweet F_Ingredients raita, F_Ingredients reduction, honeyed F_Dessert, micro F_Ingredients
this was delicious
and rather large for an app, it was perfectly F_FI_CookingLevel, a little crunch on the A_OutsideView and tender on the inside
my friend S_Delivery the wild F_FoodItem tart; caramelized F_FoodItem, herbed imported F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_Ingredients F_Ingredients
F_FoodItem also was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, had the perefect amount of every F_Ingredients
we both chose the same F_FoodItem course, pacific sole milanese; creamy fava F_FoodItem risotto, garlicky F_FoodItem, lemon F_Ingredients F_Ingredients emulsion, shaved F_Ingredients insalata
right away i noticed it looked greasy, i think the combination of the milanese with the F_Ingredients F_Ingredients emulsion made this Food very heavy and it covered the F_FI_Taste of the sole
i kept having to F_Drinks F_Drinks after every F_Appetizer
i loved the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem under the F_FoodItem, so that's what i ended up eating
dissapointed because i ended up not eating the F_FoodItem
we both chose the same F_Dessert as well, tiramisu F_Dessert; F_Ingredients F_Ingredients F_FoodItem, F_Dessert
this was a different twist on tiramsu, which is one of my favorite F_Dessert
it had a good F_FI_Taste, nothing spectacular
id give this 3 1/2 O_Exp_StarsByCus if it werent for the long S_Del_OrderingMethod and bitchy Service S_Staff
the F_FI_Price was fair and the F_FI_Quality and S_Menu was pretty good
S_Del_Time 30 S_Del_Time in S_Del_OrderingMethod at 1:30pm on a monday for Food
tried to go to Food at 6pm the night before but the S_Del_OrderingMethod was out into the A_Entertainment and although we didnt S_Del_Time prob would have been at least 90 S_Del_Time or longer
at one point i went to scoop some F_FoodItem onto my S_Cutlery but the only S_Cutlery in the F_FoodItem was slotted;/ so i borrowed the sppon next to it (which was not in F_FoodItem) and the man behind the sneeze glass came unglued!!! lol he shouted "why you not ask me for different spoon? now its all contaminated and i cannot S_Staff!!!!" i apologized but suggested he wasnt standing Restaurant when i needed the S_Cutlery and its silly to put a slotted spoon in F_FoodItem but S_Staff wasnt listening and didnt P_S_Stf_Behavior/care as he was too busy acting like an overdramatic little bitch
F_FoodItem was great, rotisserie F_FoodItem was F_FI_Quality
decent F_FI_Price for b, l & d (approx $15, $20, and $30)
be prepared to eat off schedule Food or S_Del_Time in a long S_Del_OrderingMethod
our F_FoodItem was awesomely P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
and that's coming from someone who generally avoids junk Food altogether
after the first F_Appetizer my husband and i agreed we need to come back to la creperie the next time we're in F_FoodItem
great Ambience and the Food were solid
would have given add'l O_Exp_StarsByCus if the Service was kicked up a couple notches
for a Restaurant of this caliber, overall Service O_Experience was par at best
marketing side note - lose the life-size cutout ads of rick all over the place
pretty tacky
as soon as i found out i would be traveling to phoenix, i began looking up A_Places to eat
matt's P_F_FI_Size/big Food was the first thing to crank up my yelpdar!b r i e f  s u m m a r y-- probably the most reviewed/well known place in downtown phoenix-- featured on A_Ent_Tv like everyone else said-- this newer A_LocatedArea is a block further than the old (way bigger now!)-- warm & welcoming Ambience-- P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive S_Staff (seems like they have a system)-- i P_O_Experience/recommend coming early, only 6 A_Fur_Table @ 6:45am (wed morning)-- salami scramble was definitely unique but needed some F_FoodItem-- F_Ingredients had decent flavor (F_Ingredients) but i wish i got hash browns-- waffle was hot & fresh & syrup was high F_FI_Quality-- sourdough F_FI_CookingLevel was P_F_FI_Size/thick & good-- F_FoodItem preserves were delicious!-- the regular S_Menu is very limited-- S_Staff P_O_Experience/recommends trying the Offers-- very sad i couldn't try the french F_FI_CookingLevel, it's only a Offers! :(well i woke up super early because i didn't want to get stuck Restaurant and i had a meeting at 8am! i forgot that az is an S_Del_Time ahead of ca
i woke up so tired and barely made it Restaurant at 6:45am
i walked from the westin which was a healthy walk at 6 in the morning! i was a bit P_O_Experience/disappointed to find the old A_LocatedArea but luckily i saw the new A_LocatedArea was only a block further
i really like the feel and Ambience of matt's P_F_FI_Size/big Food (mbb)
the S_Del_Time S_Staff were all ladies and S_Staff were all very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive even at 6am! i was barely awake and i wasn't sure if i was going to come Restaurant again so i ended up S_Delivery basically 2 Food so i could try 2 things
my S_Staff loves the waffle so i had to get it
the Offers she also P_O_Experience/recommended but i'm just not a fan of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem so i opted for the F_FoodItem
i'm from the san francisco bay area so i'm almost accustomed to what mbb is doing with F_FI_Quality, local F_Ingredients
i applaud them for keeping their Food F_FI_Quality so high but i wasn't uberly P_O_Experience/impressed because i'm sort of used to it
i expect to O_Payment a decent amount of money for high F_FI_Quality Food
i didn't feel like F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Price/overpriced, i thought the F_FI_Price were about right in my opinion
the waffle was above average and i could F_FI_Taste the F_FI_Quality of the syrup
i really wanted the french F_FI_CookingLevel but it wasn't being offered
to me, if you're famous for french F_FI_CookingLevel, you should offer it on your S_Menu! nevertheless, the waffle is a good alternative
the salami scramble was so unique and different
i've never had anything quite like it but i really wish they would have added some creamy F_FoodItem to smooth out the salami after F_FI_Taste
i think i added some ketchup or hot F_Ingredients to my F_Ingredients and it helped balance the salami
if you like salami, i P_O_Experience/recommend
i probably wouldn't S_Delivery again, i just was feeling adventurous
i was a bit P_O_Experience/surprised that the sourdough F_FoodItem was so P_F_FI_Size/thick but it was still good
the preserves really enabled me to eat all of it otherwise it would been just too much F_FoodItem for me
clearly this place is living up to the hype as it is the number 1 O_Exp_StarsByCus place in downtown phoenix
i didn't search further than that because i didn't have a rental car or anything
i would definitely P_O_Experience/recommend coming Restaurant and if i'm ever out Restaurant again, i hope that i can grab some of their french F_FI_CookingLevel!
pro: it is not very busy for Food and you can easily grab a A_Fur_Table and a quick Food when other places nearby are busy
not a bad A_Places to eat and have a F_Drinks
con: a pretty average Restaurant with no special flair
nothing special
i have been a few times and will P_O_Experience/go_again
what?!? i had O_Reservation Restaurant for 10pm for my girlfriends birthday (S_OpenHours at 11) the host tells me they 'feel like' S_OpenHours early, and they won't Service us
i ask to speak to the S_Staff and he says he won't allow that
the F_Drinks who were leaving when were denied said it was gross and super greasy anyway
if you choose to eat at what they used to call, "F_Drinks Restaurant" (you know, the 24 S_Del_Time, huge S_Menu, Food all day places) then Restaurant bellagio is as nice as they come
it's so luxurious sitting in Restaurant bellagio and peering out into the conservatory, having the aromas of the A_Decor and being able to see all the seasonal displays
if you go, ask to sit close to the conservatory, instead of in the back of the Restaurant where all you get to see is keno screen
the Service at Restaurant bellagio is great; i asked specifically for watermelon on my F_FoodItem S_Cutlery and the S_Staff made sure it happened (by having someone run to another A_Plc_Kitchen to aquire some)
i would P_O_Experience/recommend Restaurant bellagio to anyone wanting to enjoy Food by the conservatory, or anyone that wants a reasonably F_FI_Price Food
we used a Restaurant
com deal to try this local spot for the first time
we were definitely charmed by the A_Plc_Patio and A_OutsideView A_Places, but not so much by the $25 yucky short F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and $12 F_Drinks down F_Drinks
the sides (cornbread and F_Ingredientsmed F_Ingredients- S_Staff selections) were decent the F_FoodItem F_Appetizer had good flavor but again all wayyy overpriced
won't be back
my husband and i love Restaurant! it's right down the street from us so it's super convenient! the S_Staff are always nice and super P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
everyone Restaurant is really easy going and the original philly F_FoodItem sandwhichs are awesome!!!! it's the only thing i ever S_Delivery because why mess with the best? F_FI_Price are very reasonable
just wish the shopping center they were A_LocatedArea in was easier to access
and i wish they S_Delivery! ;)
we visited this A_LocatedArea on a saturday afternoon and we didn't have to S_Del_Time to be A_Fur_Table
our S_Staff was pretty nice at first
my husband and i each S_Delivery one of their F_FoodItem with a side of fries
the fries were very greasy and mushy
they were not appetizing at all
i left most of them on my S_Cutlery
the F_FoodItem honestly looked like something i could have made at home and it didn't F_FI_Taste any better
as we were eating, we noticed the Restaurant began to get a little more P_A_Env_Type/crowded
that was when the Service from our S_Staff got bad
S_Staff never came back to refill our F_Drinks or ask if we needed Food
S_Staff simply came by to give us our O_Payment
it was like S_Staff was rushing us out
very P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude
i will not be P_O_Experience/going_back, the Food really sucked and the Service really sucked
how could one not be a fan of carnevino?! it's amazing! the Food was excellent, the Service was excellent, and the F_Drinks were flowing
if you find yourself in vegas craving a really good piece of F_FoodItem, and have an overflowing wallet, this is the place to go! while the F_FI_Price were a little high for my F_FI_Taste, our traveling buddies wanted to take us Restaurant
we definitely P_O_Experience/enjoyed our Food, by far it was amazing
i sampled things i hadn't before, and it was all around enjoyable
the Service was excellent, many different S_Staff stopped by our A_Fur_Table for different things, and S_Staff was extremely P_S_Stf_Appearance/professional and P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
i absolutely loved the F_Ingredients side Food, it was by far my favorite
i also loved the F_Ingredients with the F_FoodItem (who woulda thunk?), that was amazing
the F_FoodItem was great, if you have the budget to spend
we ate dinner at Restaurant sienna on sunday night and, yet again, found a great place to eat in uptown charlotte
we were P_O_Experience/surprised to have the place almost all to ourselves, but then again, it was a sunday night and it was rainy
we loved the Ambience Restaurant - from the A_OutsideView i can see how it might be mistaken for a high priced snooty place, as a previous reviewer pointed out, and just like him, we were mistaken - it was laid back and affordable! we were very happy with the S_Menu, which offers a great selection of antipasti, F_Appetizer/F_FoodItem, and Food, which range from F_FoodItem, veal, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem
we S_Delivery the portabello for an app, along with the mussels
the mussels were the largest i have ever seen! (see pic)
and F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
the portabello was very good and my only complaint Restaurant is that Restaurant wasn't enough of it between my fiancee and i
one thing i wasn't too happy with: the F_FoodItem they bring you when you sit down
it's sliced F_FoodItem, like F_FoodItem F_FoodItem! not even P_F_FI_CookingLevel/toasted or anything, just a few pieces from a F_FoodItem you buy at your local grocery store
maybe it was just because it was a sunday, but we thought that was pretty weird
but once we F_FI_Taste the F_Appetizer we didn't even notice the F_FoodItem anymore anyway
the Service Restaurant was excellent, everything was brought to us on S_Del_Time and our S_Staff knew the S_Menu and made great recommendations
for my Food, i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem with pesto over angel hair F_FoodItem - this Food alone is a 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus Food! it was just enough, not too thick to make you feel sick after, just the perfect blend of F_FoodItem, pesto, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem - amazing! my fiancee S_Delivery the filet mignon with the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem over it
he was happy with it, although he did say the filet was pretty mediocre, and then if it didn't have the crabmeat on top it wouldn't have been anything special
but regardless, both Food were very good and we both agreed we will totally be P_O_Experience/going_back! it's on our list of places to take family members when they visit
five S_Staff makes the best F_FoodItem i have ever had in my life, period
we met another couple Restaurant for dinner last week and had a great time
we've been Restaurant before and were again, pleased
the happy hours are great, the Food and Service are very good
the indoor/A_OutsideView A_Plc_Bar & A_Plc_Patio A_Fur_Table area is roomy and nice
the times we've been Restaurant, the S_Staff, (sorry, i forgot his name
a tall man) is always so P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
check it out, you won't be P_O_Experience/disappointed!
decided to try this place for dinner
for a fast Food place, Food is very P_F_FI_Price/overpriced
the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem was dripping with F_Ingredients, and was otherwise fairly bland
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, but the fries are merely average
the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was decent at least
Service - 4atmosphere - 4food - 6vegetarian friendly - 7general awesomeness - 5we had a party of about 10 for brunch on a sunday morning, and had an incredibly difficult S_Del_Time receiving the most basic Service
getting a S_Cutlery of F_Drinks took 4 requests and about 20 min, the rest of the Food followed a similar path
i love this place!! i could eat Restaurant almost every day
Service is always great with little S_Del_Time S_Del_Time and the S_Staff is very friendly
discovered siena bistro last spring
it's been a favorite for Food ever since
it's lovely to sit A_OutsideView and enjoy the A_OutsideView and peacefulness
the frittata and F_FoodItem carbonara are great
Service has always been attentive
it's really a great value
awesome to find out that they have a regular open mic/live A_Ent_Music schedule
this is, hands down, the absolute best F_FoodItem place (not counting the fancy shmancy or seaside places)
it's a bit hidden because it's A_LocatedArea inside a higher end grocery store (that they also own), but once you find it, it's like a hidden gem that you either want to keep for yourself or show off to the whole world
i kid you not, i make the trip down to montréal whenever i can, just to eat Restaurant
the S_Staff are such good people, and their great characters show through the carefully prepared Food, which by the way are also presented in generous proportions
i've only ever had take-out from Restaurant, and i've always P_O_Experience/enjoyed the Food
it's good F_FI_Quality F_Ingredients-canadian Food, and i've never been P_O_Experience/disappointed in a Food
the sesame F_FoodItem really does set this place apart though
you have to try it
my S_Delivery have always been filled quickly, and the Service is pleasant
this spot was my favorite F_FoodItem place in the west valley
the F_FoodItem Restaurant is great and the S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
most of my out of town guests even my pickiest of friends loved it
the only complaint is that sometimes the servers are overwhelmed on the weekends and i don't get refills on my F_Drinks on those days
they need to hire more S_Staff for the busy weekends
this place is always packed with customers
i will eat Restaurant everytime i P_O_Experience/come_back to town even without the refills on F_Drinks the las vegas F_FoodItem is awesome !
i've been Restaurant a few times, mostly because it's close to my house but i like it
the atmosphere is a little loud but if you are into 85 A_Ent_Tv's displaying 40 different A_Entertainment programs it's all good
what brings me back
their mojito's
love 'em
the Food is good
i had the queso with bits of F_FoodItem
it was good
it was something you could grab at other decent mexican Restaurant
the Food is not necessarily the problem with this place
this
my friends
is another tourist trap
the F_FI_Price are in the stratosphere for the Food you get
the A_LocatedArea is smack dab in the middle of the pyramid
imagine this:  you are eating a F_FoodItem and enjoying your Food when you look up and see an ad for the bodies exhibit
with the dude's guts all hanging out
pretty bad right?  now imagine you see the bodies exhibit ad and so you turn around to see
gasp
an ad for the F_Ingredients top A_Entertainment
with his ugly mug staring right back at you
i lost my F_Appetizer after seeing F_Ingredients top, and i O_Payment a fortune for ok mexican Food
that is what is wrong with this place
the Food Food is different everyday
the S_Staff said saturdays and sundays are the best days to come
you can also check the S_Menu of the day in fb
i used to love this place but now the Service has gone downhill, they got rid of their good iced F_Drinks and substituted it with some chemical-taating off brand, their F_FI_Price have gone way up
$9
75 for a sald with F_FoodItem in a stripmall joint is way too much, the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude and the greek A_Ent_Music is sooooooo loud
they added the suite next store to their dinig A_Plc_DiningRoom, so they raised all their F_FI_Price by 2 or 3 dollars each S_Cutlery to compensate
i liked them a lot better when Restaurant were smaller, friendlier and didnt cut corners on the Food
sadly this will be or last time coming Restaurant
based on décor alone, boca 7 would get four O_Exp_StarsByCus for all its F_FoodItem-out-of-F_Drinks glam in mesa
the design work by the dentist/co-S_Staff is totally over the top
the devil is in the details and a few of them need tweaking
the heights of the black crystal chandeliers and huge red fabric spheres need to be varied to make the Ambience look less cluttered
this Restaurant is also in desperate need of a dimmer switch
it is tradition that asian Restaurant be lit like they're in the middle of a raid to emphasize that they are clean, but all those chandeliers blazing on high are too much at boca 7
the screw heads used to affix the huge asian symbols to the back A_Decor also need to be hidden
and what's with putting the cheapest paper S_Cutlery on the market on the granite A_Fur_Table?  when you've spent this much money on the A_Decor, either get a nice paper S_Cutlery or splash out for cloth S_Cutlery
unfortunately, the Food does not live up to the A_Decor
compared to a vietnamese gem like cyclo, the Food Restaurant is a bit of a P_O_Experience/disappointment
Restaurant's nothing wrong with it, but this is the Food i would expect to find in a very F_FI_Religious vietnamese Restaurant
however, this setting makes me expect something much more modern
perhaps the S_Staff should look to jin ju in chicago as a template to follow as i think that Restaurant is much closer to the concept of mod asian fare in a hip setting that would work for them
now whether or not that concept will actually work in mesa is another question altogether
the S_Menu is a hoot
it's filled with advertising and reads like a gay who's who of phoenix dentists and bankruptcy lawyers
this place is Worthiness a visit just to check out the décor
if liberace had been vietnamese, this could have been his Restaurant
i love their pumpkin F_FoodItem the most
thanks to groupon's $6 for $12 coupon i probably wouldn't know about this place
my first expeirence with new mexican Food so didn't know what to expect
similar S_Menu as your typical mexican restuarant and a few of their own
had the F_FoodItem carlito's F_FoodItem (pic) which i really liked for $7
60 with all of it's 8 complimentary add-ons, F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and so on
F_FoodItem and sour cream was extra
it was loaded with P_F_FI_Taste/tasty chunks of F_FoodItem, i could definitely F_FI_Taste a difference in the F_Ingredients and seasoning
they also have a F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem for $4
60 that you can mixup all kind of F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem together, or the combo F_FoodItem for around $6-7 which is the F_FI_Religious and F_FoodItem
total wasn't $12 yet so i added the F_FoodItem  F_FoodItem for also $7
60
they weren't that bad, had a bunch of F_Ingredients that resembled those layered F_FoodItem dips what i usually eat while watching football
F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and sour cream and some P_F_FI_Size/large F_FoodItem pieces
didn't care for their F_FoodItem, shaped and seasoned like doritos, and got soggy quickly
they have a good nightly special from 4-9pm
mondays - santa fe sliders for $1tuesdays -F_FoodItem F_FoodItem for $1wednesday - hump day - 1/2 off Food F_FoodItem till 11 am and $6 F_FoodItem
thurdays - bottomless bowls green chile shew for $6
50
friday - F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem fajitas from $6-8
saturaday - F_FoodItem for $8
95sunday - 2 for 1 Food F_FoodItem all day
they also Service F_Drinks, F_Drinks, and F_Drinks so that's cool
they were busy during Food, they had A_Fur_Table and a few A_Plc_Bar counters to eat at
also like all of their A_Decor and their open A_OutsideView of the A_Plc_Kitchen
went Restaurant dinner 1/31/12
they had the unlimited F_FoodItem tail for $70 special
really liked their selection
nice F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem legs were already S_OpenHours for easy eating
good overall
if you are in some serious craving for some gourmet F_FoodItem, come Restaurant! you have to O_Payment a little, but it's Worthiness it!you get a S_Menu of their pre-made F_FoodItem or you can just customize it!  you get to choose a huge array of F_Ingredients and other nice sautéed F_Ingredients
what makes their F_FoodItem extra good is the F_FoodItem and the patty
the F_FoodItem is sooo soft and F_FI_CookingLevel while the F_FoodItem is so perfectly made
after the first F_Appetizer, i just kept eating away
i never finished a F_FoodItem so fast
hehehehe! =)
the A_LocatedArea of fugu is a huge bonus
being A_LocatedArea on state st right on campus, it's definitely popular amongst students especially
they Service good sze chuan Food, which means that the majority of the Food will be F_FI_CookingLevel with P_F_FI_Taste/spicy oil -- making F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Taste/spicy
their S_Menu actually runs pretty parallel to that of ichiban
i have written a review of that pretty recently and i S_Delivery and P_O_Experience/recommend the same favorites as i do at ichiban
plus, tRestaurant are many reviews of fugu out Restaurant with good Service on what to get, so i will talk more about the O_Experience and Service Restaurant
went to Food once for my post-seminar celebration with my group
we had the Food specials, which was a good deal coming to about $10
it has a set consisting of the F_FoodItem course, a F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem to go with it
most of their sets are Service in bento boxes, which is a pretty cool concept
for dinner you just S_Delivery off their S_Menu
Service wise, it's a little off what i could call top-notch
which means that your F_FoodItem course Food might come before or together with your F_Appetizer
on some occasion especially when they are busy, you might have to remind them about parts of your S_Delivery
but they are pretty good about reminders, and will get you what you want fast
i would visit more often but ichiban has equally good sze chuan delicacies with a much larger sitting area and ample S_Parking
between one or the other it all F_FI_CookingLevel down to personal preference and convenience
if i live downtown and i do not have a car, fugu will be the logical option
otherwise, take your pick, either way you will get nice sze chuan Food =)
wow, i went Restaurant for the first time today without checking reviews
thank god i didn't because i would have missed out on a great Food
maybe they are better when its slow
anyways, Restaurant's my take:Service - very good, our S_Staff checked up on us twice, brought Food and F_Drinks all within 30 S_Del_Time
Food was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot, F_Drinks were cold, 9
5/10 because it was very slow so no excuses
Food/F_Drinks F_FI_Quality: once again very good
i had the quesadilla cancun and the filling was as P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot as a fajita when i dug in
margaritas were also decent, not as strong as i like but it was only 4pm so it's ok
my only complaint was the F_FoodItem were a tad cold
otherwise 9/10
price - it was $40 for two Food and two F_Drinks including tip, for the F_FI_Quality and A_Places it was a decent price
could have had a P_F_FI_Size/larger F_FoodItem of sides, so id give it a 8/10
O_Experience - very A_Decor crowd at 4pm, im sure it picks up after 6
very colorful Restaurant with nice A_Decor and pretty cool carved tabletops and A_Fur_Table, although a little cramped in the A_Fur_Table it was a nice looking mexican Restaurant
8/10
overall - 34
5/40 - thank god the reviews below are no longer the case, it was a very good Food and i will P_O_Experience/be_back
maybe they had a change of S_Staff? i would P_O_Experience/reccommend this place
never seen so many kids work so hard at a fast Food Restaurant
this place was crazy and they are getting them in and out
great job S_Staff
i know its a fast Food chain Restaurant, but normally the Food is pretty decent but when i went to this one, Service was very slow and the Food was so so
i do not think i will be P_O_Experience/coming_back Restaurant again
i'm not a fan of golden corral, but since my parents got coupons we went Restaurant for brunch
all golden corrals are pretty cheap considering the amount of Food you can actually eat
the Food wasn't bad, F_FoodItem was pretty P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and since we went 10 S_Del_Time before Food was over we got to get the chance of getting free F_FoodItem F_Drinks
i walked in and saw a Food A_Decor, which i don't think i've seen in any other golden corrals before
i grew up going to these Restaurant, so as default i got sick of it and never come
this golden corral was pretty new, right to the new opened walmart, this Restaurant is A_LocatedArea in the right place for business
the S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Behavior/helped with any F_Drinks and picking up S_Cutlery
the S_Staff were also P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful if you wanted something from the grill
A_Plc_Bathroom were pretty clean, so if you need a break and need to drop some weight to eat more, you're welcome to do it! haha
very diverse crowd which makes golden corral feel more homey and you could get a nice look of the diversity in charlotte
anyways, i'll come back if my parents have the F_FI_Taste for it
this Restaurant isn't bad, especially if you're hungry for F_FoodItem or any of their many selections
eating at benedict's made me feel like having brunch at my favorite aunt's house
the Restaurant was homey, the Service was warm and the Food was comforting
the place was small and only had a few small A_Fur_Table
Restaurant were some A_Fur_Table A_OutsideView that offered A_Fur_Table for larger groups
i can easily understand if it would take a while to get a A_Fur_Table on a busy day
good thing (or unfortunately) we got to benedict's a little past Food already
we immediately got a A_Fur_Table and we were greeted as soon as we went through the door
i don't think they have a lot of S_Staff
take note of this when you visit this place when it's busy
i would think S_Staff would scramble to make sure S_Staff is P_S_Stf_Behavior/helped and taken P_S_Stf_Behavior/cared of
as i've written, the place felt like home, even my own mom or aunt would have a hard time managing several guest at one time
the Service was hands-on
the lady who Service us during our visit was very warm
S_Staff was engaging and very P_S_Staff/friendly
again, like what i wrote, S_Staff was just like my favorite aunt
i did have some concerns, else i would have O_Exp_StarsByCus this with 5 O_Exp_StarsByCus
i S_Delivery 3 Food from their S_Menu that were not available
thus, why coming Restaurant late might be a disadvantage
they ran out of F_FoodItem for the F_FoodItem, challah F_FoodItem for the french F_FI_CookingLevel and avocado for the california F_FoodItem benedict
would have been nice to try it out
maybe i'll come in early the next S_Del_Time so i get to try what i want
the Food that were Service to us was very good
let me correct that, it was very good
it was better than other big time brunch places that i have visited
it was original and full of flavor
we had the arizona F_FoodItem benedict and their F_FoodItem and bacon croissant F_FoodItem
the croissant F_FoodItem was soft, airy and P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
the additional kick on the F_FoodItem was the pesto F_Ingredients
the F_FoodItem was F_FI_CookingLevel nicely and the F_FoodItem, though not as P_F_FI_Taste/crispy as i wanted had a good F_Appetizer as well
my wife loved the arizona F_FoodItem benedict
it had tomatillo F_Ingredients instead of the usual hollandaise F_Ingredients
Restaurant was also a hint of F_Ingredients tortilla F_FI_Taste on the F_Ingredients that gave the Food a mexican finish
F_FoodItem were poached perfectly and the runny F_FoodItem complimented the F_Ingredients
the sausage wasn't bad as well
not too P_F_FI_Healthy/salty and but had enough kick at the end to tell you that you are eating a sausage
F_Drinks and F_FoodItem were also very good
add the warm Ambience and Service with good, benedict's Restaurant just felt like home

P_A_Env_Size/thin, square (that's their gimmick 'our F_FoodItem is in a square shape') dry Restaurant-resteraunt F_FoodItem that's forgettable
F_FoodItem also uninspired
last night i had one of the best Food of my life
i found out that bistro la bon,  a Restaurant i've been wanting to try forever, has a 10 course tasting every thursday
for $35pp you get 10 amazing courses, bigger A_Places than i thought too
the S_Staff is so P_S_Stf_Experience/creative and i think this is his play time
he puts together F_Ingredients you wouldn't think to but they turn out amazing
i know the first two and last two S_Cutlery, but i'm a little uncertain on the S_Delivery in between
watermelon gazpacho that was unexpectedly (and delightfully) a little spicy2
fresh buffalo mozzarella with heirloom F_FoodItem, micro F_FoodItem, and 12 yr balsamic3
F_FoodItem F_FoodItem stuffed peppadew F_FoodItem with carmalized F_FoodItem and a F_Ingredients honey F_Ingredients - this was a favorite4
seared F_FoodItem over mashed F_Ingredients with demi glaze- dining partner said F_FoodItem was perfectly F_FI_CookingLevel
crispy avocado and F_FoodItem with sweet F_Ingredients F_Ingredients- another favorite6
F_FoodItem- don't remember much about it, i don't like seafood7
sweedish F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients with ligonberry8
some kind of cream F_FoodItem whipped cream with ouzi? F_FoodItem- really good and very different9
the most amazing F_FoodItem S_Cutlery with a brie type F_FoodItem and apricot marmalade that went perfect together10
Food flourless F_FoodItem with mango sorbetthe Food was just to die for, but also the anticipation of what was coming next was really exciting
i can't wait to P_O_Experience/go_back
it's different every week
i have visit alot of mexican Restaurant especially in us in n
y and sf
im very picky when it comes to Food, because i only want to have the best
A_Decor: very nice, both A_Decor and S_Staff: P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive, but without any smilefood: now the most important of a mexican concept, everything was ok, F_FoodItem S_Cutlery was very good, faijtas was also ok
the guacalole was not good, it was really bad actually
the marguritas was very good
probably one of the better mexican places in edinburgh
my wife loves this place regardless of where we are, but i just don't have that same love for chipotle as S_Staff does
lol - well, Restaurant was one down the street from where we were staying last week, so we stopped by for Food
their S_Staff is very P_S_Stf_Behavior/enthusiastic as they greet you with a huge hello, how are ya as soon as you enter the business
they S_Menu is, of course, the same as all the others, but the black F_FoodItem just F_FI_Taste better than usual, for some reason
i just got the bowl with barbacoa to keep it safe because i've been known as a bit of a "tortilla snob"
haha, but this S_Cutlery was very, very good
i was absolutely P_O_Experience/impressed with the F_FI_Taste of this Food and will definitely go back the next time we're in town visiting our daughter!#kudosontheenthusiasm
i like centurion
it's got more A_Places now after their expansion, and it's a quirky, unusual O_Experience
you feel really close to the A_Plc_Kitchen and S_Staff, and the Food is always good
it's terrific that after 5pm weekday and all day saturday and sunday, street S_Parking is completely free (so no need to add coins)
trust me, i live downtown
their 7 course tasting S_Menu is unbelievably tasty ($50 for Food only, $75 with F_Drinks pairings)
the 21% gratuity they automatically add though is highly annoying (15% is fine, 18% okay, but 21% is a mugging)
Service is good
their risotto of the day is unbelievable ($8)
they make the best risotto in all of phoenix, in my opinion, and are creativetheir F_FoodItem are good too, but maybe a dollar or two too P_F_FI_Price/expensive
their mussels are also a standout and fairly priced
personally, i'd stick with the three above for an everyday dinner, and the tasting S_Menu for a special occasion like an anniversary
their brunch is also fun
P_O_Experience/disappointment on a tiny S_Cutlery
i'm giving tpf 3 O_Exp_StarsByCus because the Restaurant is exceptionally beautiful, they had live spanish guitar and a flamenco A_Ent_LiveShow when i was Restaurant and the sangria is fabulous
the Food on the other hand , blah
from someone who F_FI_CookingLevel and considers eating a A_Entertainment, i could totally F_FI_Taste that many of the F_Ingredients had been bought pre made and frozen
i'll give a little run down on what we had
F_FoodItem- were P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen, par baked like you buy at the grocery store for thanksgiving dinner but they did come with the most amazing F_FoodItem dip
they called it aioli ,it wasn't even close to an aioli, but delicious all the same
almondigas con tomate - essentially P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen F_FoodItem balls sitting in canned spaghetti F_Ingredients
tortilla de patatas - F_Ingredients used to make it - P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen  pisto gratinado~ F_Ingredients in iberico béchamel F_Ingredients covered in puff F_FoodItem - 2nd best Food we had
the highlight of the Food was an open faced F_FoodItem with P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem and goat F_FoodItem
i don't see it on the online S_Menu to get the actual name but it was gooey, garlicy,goat cheesy and i could have eaten 3 of them
F_FoodItem - P_F_FI_Taste/tasty, tart and a great deal
the sangria on its own is $8 a glass but by the pitcher it is only $36
we got 6 full glasses out of the pitcher so you can do the math on the value
we had a few other things but they weren't Worthiness mentioning
i'm also not going to go to detailed into the Service because the place was packed and had several large parties of self entitled scottsdaleites blocking the aisles and demanding much more attention than was necessary but i will say it was about 30 mins before we got our F_Drinks and over an hour before we got our 1st Food
the rest came about 25 mins after that
the S_Staff was apologetic and we understood that it was more the A_Plc_Kitchen and clientele than Food else
i wouldn't P_O_Experience/go_back for the Food but i would for the A_Ent_Music and the sangria
corner F_FoodItem is a decent place to grab a decent F_FoodItem, and the F_FI_Price are pretty good as well, although Restaurant are other pizzerias in the city that do give better value for money
however, if you live local, then it's a great place to go to
the Restaurant does not do deliveries, but if you call them up you can pre-S_Delivery a F_FoodItem so that is ready when you get tRestaurant
when i came Restaurant i S_Delivery a 12" pepperoni F_FoodItem and it was £6, which is pretty good, although the F_FoodItem was more greasy than normal and i used a tissue to absorb areas of excess F_Ingredients
the F_Drinks F_FI_Price Restaurant were also pretty expensive so i decided to go to a local off-license to get a F_Drinks Restaurant instead
corner F_FoodItem also do other Food Food as well, such as kebabs, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and a range of ben and jerry F_Ingredients creams
i was tired my child was tired, i S_Delivery on the phone to expedite the Food to bring home, my child ate at wendy's right around the corner, i S_Delivery my 40 dollars worth of Food, gave my name and phone number
i said can you have it ready at 8pm
¨no problem¨ they said
ha ha ha i S_Del_Time like a dope til 8pm because my kid ate and we were done by 7:35
i walked in at 8pm and they said ¨my name¨ i was thinking wow !  they said okay ¨we make S_Delivery now" omg  i would give them zero O_Exp_StarsByCus but i can't
i still want to try one thing on the S_Menu i never tried anywhere else sounds good, but i refuse
i never see anyone in the place i pass it daily
laundering money? hm
we meet Restaurant every wednesday and it's always awesome
megan is a great S_Staff and i love the P_F_FI_Size/big F_FoodItem!
hooray! we finally made it Restaurant for Food
it felt as though we were in downtown phoenix again due to the hip and locally owned feel
i wish Restaurant could be so many more places like this in the A_Environment
the Ambience is small and charming
you can certainly tell a lot of love and effort were put into making this establishment a success
they S_Staff Food, Food and dinner
have F_Drinks's, Food F_Drinks's, F_Drinks, F_Drinks, F_Drinks, F_Drinks and hard F_Drinks
it's small inside with about 6 A_Fur_Table and a A_Plc_Bar with A_Fur_Table around it as well
cute F_FoodItem friendly A_Plc_Patio with umbrellas A_OutsideView
multiple F_FI_Religious options available! i had the F_FI_Religious-tarian F_FoodItem and it was great
seems like they have varied S_Menu options and special Food that change from day to day
the F_Ingredients were fresh and F_FI_Quality
32 has done amazingly with a concept that is very difficult for Restaurant
to excel at all 3 Food, keep up S_Menu, have a spectacular F_Drinks A_Plc_Bar, innovative S_Menu, and now have a full A_Plc_Bar as well
Restaurant is even a drive through A_Furniture! i felt right at home and cannot wait to come back for some F_Drinks
the F_Drinks list looked extensive and varied
keep supporting local and get Restaurant! it's amazing
i kind of want to live in a little loft above it
i love this place
we try and go every other week
the Service is a little slow but the Food is great
i have been to several thai Restaurant from nyc to ca and this one is in my top 3 for sure!
this is a brand new Restaurant
i was excited to see that it's now open
the A_Decor has a cool bistro A_Decor
i sat on the A_Plc_Patio with my bike because there is no S_Parking
Restaurant are a lack of bike racks at the arizona center, in general
but back to the Restaurant, the Food was pretty good
i had trouble deciding what to try
i had a F_FoodItem and it was ok, but next time i would try an actual Food Food
my friend said the F_Drinks was really good
F_FI_Price are medium ranged
similar to those of paradise bakery, one of their competitors i would assume
the S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
i love this place! it's right next to my house! i brought so many friends and family over Restaurant! i S_Delivery F_FoodItem to go almost every week! stuff is always nice and happy to see you:) i P_O_Experience/recommend to check it out! it's good for 2 or big party!!!!
this place is mind-blowing
awesome home-F_FI_CookingLevel style brazilian Food at an affordable F_FI_Price
perfectly P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem, great vegetarian options, and savory smoothies (try the mango!) don't get discouraged by the long cooking S_Del_Time - the S_Staff/S_Staff is making everything a la S_Del_Time in the back
this place is simply glorious
to add even more to the proverbial pie, the S_Staff gave us bowls of what i can only describe as the best lentil F_Appetizer i've ever had, on the house, because of the S_Del_Time
this is a gem that should not be ignored!
awful awful Food and Service! an insult to F_Ingredients/asian Food! seriously! i figured, since it was featured in the F_Ingredients newspaper, it must somehow represent what we eat
but no
not one Food was acceptable
they had a thailand style F_FoodItem, which in my opinion should be made with something along mango, F_Ingredients, sweet and spicy
but it was chop suey with F_FoodItem F_Ingredients and tiny bit of F_Ingredients! the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was all breading, goey sticky starchy F_Ingredients, A_Env_Size, too sweet
Restaurant was no F_FoodItem available even though it is one of their most marketed S_Menu Food
and the Service was beyond bad
even though it is a all you can eat, after S_Delivery the first time, they seem to try to ignore you as much as possible as soon as you try to S_Delivery something else
we S_Del_Time 30 S_Del_Time for a second round, abandonned and asked for the O_Payment
surprisingly, the O_Payment came in fast enough
i really do not P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant at all
i just can't say i was that P_O_Experience/impressed
nice P_F_FI_Size/big F_FoodItem and decent F_FI_Price but the Food took a really long S_Del_Time to come out and it just wasn't that great
outstanding!  wonderful Food, F_FoodItem, and Service!  my husband and i frequently Restaurant and enjoy trying local places and we are so pleased that we came Restaurant
the S_Staff was great and when we were A_Fur_Table S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/honest and told us we could S_Delivery F_FoodItem and relax a little so the A_Plc_Kitchen could catch up!  we went for a relaxing evening and that definitely started it - he offered great input for various Food on the S_Menu based on what we said we like
the Food was top notch - P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem F_FI_CookingLevel to perfection, and the F_FoodItem gidori was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
we shared an upside down F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem F_Ingredients-cream, yummy
all courses were great and the F_FI_Price was very reasonable for the Food we received
the Ambience was cozy and sophisticated
we highly P_O_Experience/recommend trying this - we will P_O_Experience/go_back !
worst Service ever
the F_FoodItem is not P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, okay some places aren't P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh but at least they F_FI_Taste good
lots and lots of F_FoodItem in their F_FoodItem
the S_Staff don't want to be Restaurant and don't know how to handle large groups
overall, i would never return
unbelievably P_F_FI_Taste/delicious Food Restaurant
the value this little gem offers is fantastic- thai Food to the delicious F_Drinks
we came during the week and had outstanding Service and a terrific time
the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients kicked it off and we had a great Food all the way through to the F_FoodItem eye finish! and if the Food itself was not even enough don't leave with out a pot of F_Drinks and a thai F_FoodItem! don't be scared the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem makes it
give it a shot you are gonna love it!
very unethical and no integrity
went in with a comp
asked S_Staff if they accept it Restaurant
they told me yes and i S_Delivery and ate
S_Del_Time to O_Payment the O_Payment and they told me the computer will not accept it and they dont accept the comps anymore
got S_Staff and S_Staff said same thing
i told S_Staff why should i O_Payment for your S_Staff mistake?  S_Staff said sorry, but they cant do Food and they cant discount my O_Payment
nice
what that tells me is if they make a mistake i will O_Payment for it
if the Food is cold, if it takes an S_Del_Time, if F_FoodItem P_F_FI_CookingLevel/burnt
you will still O_Payment or it
when you have so many S_Menu in town (and aria as well), why go Restaurant?
i am angry this place drove out teakwoods
it's a convenient A_Environment spot, so my husband and i were hoping at least a great new place drove away our favorite F_FoodItem and A_Entertainment A_Plc_Bar
no
the S_Staff were too P_S_Stf_Behavior/lazy to change the A_Decor, it was dark and weird and confused
the A_Places is underutilized, the S_Menu had no direction, and the Food was awful
the entire place lacks both concept and execution
we will not be returning, and are sad to have lost  a A_Environment gem
i wish i could O_Exp_StarsByCus this higher
along with most of you, i love supporting local Restaurant and businesses - especially if it's a Food joint
however, while the Food was decent, nothing about my O_Experience really stood out
walking in, my friend and i were the only ones in Restaurant, except for one person A_Fur_Table at the counter about to leave
i wasn't sure whether the lack of customers was because the Food was bad or simply because it was late morning on a thursday
i ended up getting the Food sliders, due to many good reviews of it Restaurant on yelp
yes the F_Appetizer were fresh, and yes they were good
but overall, the Food was just meh
my sausage was super oily and the F_Ingredients were underseasoned
as for my F_Drinks? super burnt, which is usually a huge indicator that it's just been sitting on the warmer for quite some time
it was completely and utterly undrinkable
sad to say, i probably wouldn't P_O_Experience/recommend this spot next time my friends and i are trying to find somewhere to eat
but, if any of them want to try it, i wouldn't be opposed to giving it a second chance
if you like Food that's been dropped on the A_Places and Service to you anyways then this is the place to go otherwise the Food is really good
confession time
authentic mexican Food places intimidate me
i am very interested in trying out new things but rarely do because of the language barrier
the S_Staff at F_FoodItem F_FoodItem are the nicest most P_S_Stf_Behavior/helpful S_Staff i have ever had at an 'over the counter' Restaurant
my first time in they took the time to explain the entire S_Menu and let me sample all the different F_FoodItem
it was a great O_Experience
i settled on soyrizo
the Food is excellent
as a confused white S_Staff i think of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem as a chipotle style Ambience with real mexican F_FI_Taste
i make a point to stop by and try something new whenever i am on the east side
came to carmines for a business dinner
we had a large group and the S_Staff was really great about changing our A_Fur_Table as our party size increased
we sat near the back and could watch as the S_Staff brought out the Food for other Food and man just like the reveiws say - F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Size/huge! i've been to other family style italian Restaurant (bucca or maggianos) and i think carmines is way better than both of those
we S_Delivery the carmines F_FoodItem and anti F_FoodItem Food to start
then our F_FoodItem were F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem in red F_Ingredients, veal parm, and broccoli and sausage rigatoni in white F_Ingredients
F_FoodItem were all really P_F_FI_Taste/tasty- i especially liked the veal parm
for F_Dessert we had the titanic and choc F_FoodItem F_Appetizer
all in all a great Food - had F_Drinks flowing and good fun
i do have to mention they have a S_Staff Restaurant that sings Food opera -- amazing
S_Staff was singing happy birthday to a few folks and came over and sang our group a different song
he was super nice and he's really good! go see him for yourself!!!
absolutely fantastic! fresh, unique and tons of S_Menu
kids loved it too
definitely making this a regular stop
very quiet over Food S_Del_Time
was exactly what i was looking for too
however i hope they aren't relying on their Food A_Env_Type for business, because it's lacking
the Food was great
$8
10 for F_Appetizer, F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem and brown F_FoodItem
ladies working were super nice and i P_O_Experience/enjoyed their company while sitting at the A_Plc_Bar
i'll be back
super spicy just the way i like it!!!
good F_FoodItem; they marinate cheaper, tougher cuts of F_FoodItem & make it F_FI_Taste good by charcoal grilling
the side of F_Ingredients was excellent
we P_O_Experience/enjoyed the skirt and hanger F_FoodItem
the caesar F_FoodItem was good but  the A_Decor did not F_FI_Taste like it had F_FoodItem in it
the S_Staff was the ditziest i have ever experienced
every 3rd word was yummie
gr8 english vocabulary S_Staff had, dah
poor vegas education or just an absolute ditz
when we asked about the sides
well, S_Staff comment was they are all so awesome & yummie with no description of any
we finally got F_FoodItem as we finished our Food
the tuscan F_FoodItem was the P_F_FI_Healthy/saltiest i have ever had
absolutely inedible
we will  return for the F_FoodItem & sides
they are quite disorganized with so many S_Staff that are poorly trained or just poorly educated young kids
poor on the Service side
definitely not even S_OpenHours to t bones in red rock
the F_FoodItem in the butcher Restaurant are off the chart P_F_FI_Price/expensive & they raise the per lb price almost every day
no way is a lousy P_F_FI_CookingLevel/tough ny strip F_FoodItem worth $27
/lb
the whole carcusses are hanging in their A_Furniture as are 2 whole headless pigs and their heads are on the top shelf
that is enough to turn anybody off
very attractive Restaurant but extremely loud with marble-like hard A_Places
the Restaurant is on the 2nd A_Places
nice A_OutsideView dining if it is not too hot outdoors
relatively new local joint S_OpenHours to home
nice A_Decor on the inside!  very clean
wait S_Staff was good, but not great
now on to the Food and F_Drinks
b and g F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
carne asada F_FoodItem were ok
F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was good
they S_Staff a good S_Menu of local micro brews
need to P_O_Experience/come_back for some 'shine and copper mule!  nice place,  we will P_O_Experience/be_back
finally got Restaurant for dinner, heard about this Restaurant from my friends many times! the Food F_FI_Quality is good, A_Environment is not bad, doesn't feel like those typical japanese Restaurant, i definitely will P_O_Experience/come_back again!! had a great dinner Restaurant!! love it
!!!
i ate Restaurant last night
it was better than when we tried to go when they first opened - too crowded, not enough wait S_Staff
i had the F_FoodItem eye F_FoodItem it was so so
the F_Ingredients was just F_Ingredients and some F_FoodItem, nothing to write home about
will go again try something different, to get my final opinion of this place
today was my fourth visit and probably my last visit
i was extremely happy the first time because i'm from chicago and grew up on al's on (taylor)
anyway, the Food was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
i think i even wrote a good review the first time i came Restaurant
however the second time i went i was P_O_Experience/disappointed the F_FoodItem was luke P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm and F_FoodItem were kinda P_F_FI_Healthy/salty but still had great flavor
third visit went the same way, so i thought to myself maybe i'm going to often and my F_FI_Taste buds are getting use to the Food
well today i went after about 2 months and it was the same type of Food but worse
the F_FoodItem was cold, the fries well i'll just say i had fries with my F_Ingredients, it was ridiculous
i got upset because F_FoodItem pretty P_F_FI_Price/pricey
i don't want to ruin what i grew up on so i'll wait to go to a chicago to have al's on taylor
i gave it 3 O_Exp_StarsByCus because the S_Staff is always nice, the S_Staff remembered me big plus because i love great customer Service
the Restaurant is always clean and the flavor of the F_FoodItem was good
i P_O_Experience/suggest getting a different warmer for the F_FoodItem and tell your S_Staff easy with the F_Ingredients
i stopped in for a A_Decor Food and was favorably P_O_Experience/impressed by the place
it's a nice, clean, well-A_Decor dining A_Plc_DiningRoom
the S_Del_Time S_Staff was P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and Restaurant was no S_Del_Time for Service
i S_Delivery the half F_FoodItem with F_Appetizer and cornbread
the F_FoodItem was a nice combination of F_FoodItem greens
the cornbread was a huge chunk that could easily have been shared among 4 Food
the reason i'm giving them only a 4 O_Exp_StarsByCus rating is that the chunky pot roast F_Appetizer was too salty for me
when my S_Staff checked back with me i told S_Staff about the F_FI_Taste
S_Staff apologized and offered to bring a bowl of their F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_Appetizer instead
that was too F_Ingredientsy for me as well
it may be that i'm just too sensitive to F_Ingredients
whatever, S_Staff were very P_S_Stf_Behavior/accommodating and asked what they could offer instead
since i'd pigged out on all that F_FoodItem and the P_F_FI_Taste/yummy F_Ingredients F_FoodItem, i was no longer hungry
so they took the F_FI_Price of the F_Appetizer off my O_Payment
i don't consider my personal sensitivity to F_Ingredients to be any fault of my S_Staff
accordingly, i added the F_FI_Price of the F_Appetizer to her tip
i was a P_O_Experience/satisfied customer when i left, and i'll definitely P_O_Experience/be_back to try something from their Food S_Menu
so bomb the dim sum option is on point like seriously
P_O_Experience/recommend this place for those craving asian Food on a budget
i will definitely P_O_Experience/come_back for sure ;)
the pan fried dumplings and a F_Drinks F_Drinks boba F_Drinks were my christmas dinner
i wish i had chosen more wisely
we came Restaurant after wandering the strip because i was cold and starving and just couldn't S_Del_Time any longer for Food
it wasn't bad
it was actually pretty good
F_FoodItem was just way more P_F_FI_Price/expensive than it was worth
my Food was $22 which is ridiculous for those two Food
i got 6 dumplings
for that, i should have gotten more dumplings or 6 with more exotic F_Ingredients than just F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
$13 is appropriate for 6 dumplings if they're made of ostrich or kobe F_FoodItem
the three O_Exp_StarsByCus are because my boyfriend had an amazing F_FoodItem
a little more P_F_FI_Price/expensive than the Food truck ($8) but it was ok because it's something i can't recreate by myself, decent A_Places F_FI_Size and you can't get it just anywhere
i don't know specifically which one he had, but F_FoodItem was absolutely P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
5 O_Exp_StarsByCus for fukuburger just by itself
the dumplings weren't bad but they weren't outstanding either
just average
i encourage you to try the F_FoodItem if you're curious about fame, but i'll never come back for Food else
a bit P_F_FI_Price/overpriced, but for being part of the new downtown summerlin, i can see how they want to cater for a certain crowd
came Restaurant for an office Food, we made O_Reservation for 10
even though we had a O_Reservation and made it on S_Del_Time, we still had to S_Del_Time 20mins
not too bad, but you would think they have the A_Fur_Table ready for a O_Reservation beforehand
the F_FoodItem was ok, i had better
i feel it was somewhat plain with the S_Menu only A_Entertainment the 'standard' specials
like spicy crunch F_FoodItem
etc
nothing too fancy that can be seen as signature
as for the Food, we had a bunch of F_FoodItem, standard blt, F_FoodItem, etc
the the kobe F_FoodItem was the most fancy one
i personally had the sautéed norwegian F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was tender, P_F_FI_Taste/flavorful, but not dry
the F_Ingredients was creamy and perfectly paired with the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
i P_O_Experience/recommend this 100%
for this F_FoodItem alone, i would P_O_Experience/come_back, my husband likes classic F_FoodItem so he is good with that
the Ambience is nice, very modern, suiting the overall setting of the mall
only visited during Food, so we'll see how dinner will be
perhaps i'll update the review when we have done so with my dinner O_Experience
S_Staff was S_Stf_Behavior, didn't know the Offers, again, went Restaurant opening week, so i'm sure everything was new
visited this Restaurant fast Food estsblishment last night as the little one wanted a F_FoodItem
drove through and S_Delivery some Food to S_Del_OrderingMethod
little one took the F_FoodItem out and exclaimed how P_F_FI_Size/small F_FoodItem was
in fact he said i hope F_FoodItem is two!  (F_FoodItem were half the F_FI_Size of any F_FoodItem we ever saw!) little one then started pealing the breading off the F_FoodItem (which he likes to eat last) revealing a very F_Ingredients skinney little F_Ingredients about the F_FI_Size of my pointing finger
cant believe S_Staff would S_Staff this P_F_FI_CookingLevel/burnt shriveled half sized  F_FoodItem to anyone
sonic should be deeply ashamed
i also had some F_FoodItem F_FoodItem was overbreaded and P_F_FI_Taste/tasteless
ugh
! if for some reason you like sonic, it must not be for Food we  S_Delivery
my first and last Restaurant for sure
ra is ok
i like to go to hh but if u don't get Restaurant early, it starts to get real loud
the Food is usually great, the F_FoodItem is my favorite
i also usually Food the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, & F_FoodItem
F_FI_Price are decent during hh
last time i went the A_Fur_Table smelled weird :(
fellow hikers and i stopped Restaurant elvira's Food on a recent saturday after a hike up gold canyon to see the petroglyphs
Food is one of my favorite Food groups, so i won't say "no" to trying a new Restaurant! (and certainly not after just having torched 1,019 calories hiking before Food
)we arrived right around Food time and were quickly accommodated with A_Fur_Table and A_Furniture pulled together for our group
the A_Decor A_Decor is very bright and colorful; we found ourselves looking around at all the different A_Decor
i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem with double F_FoodItem (no F_FoodItem)
the F_Ingredients gave it a different F_FI_Taste than i'm used to, but it was really good
the added F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients made for a perfect combination
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were excellent too
the A_Plc_RestRoom are A_Plc_RestRoom, so if you have a group who, say, just came from hiking gold canyon and say, all have to go the A_Plc_Bathroom, well
make sure you get in the A_Fur_Door first
we had great Service, and it wasn't too A_Env_Type on a saturday for Food
i P_O_Experience/recommend this place!
we Ambience refer to F_FoodItem bell as F_FoodItem hell
sometimes S_Staff get your S_Delivery S_Delivery and sometimes S_Staff don't
just make sure you Food it before you leave
this one has an A_OutsideView A_Plc_Patio which is nice when it is A_Env_Type A_LocatedArea in A_LocatedArea
only popped in for a few F_Drinks on a sunday afternoon
caught in-between the two Offers, ended up with two $F_FI_Price blue moons
S_Staff was leslie and S_Staff was very nice and upon wandering around the Restaurant was pretty P_O_Experience/impressed with the A_Env_Size and other nooks and crannies like the small upstairs A_Plc_Patio and sneaky small A_Plc_Patio
A_Places also had A_Places and lots of A_Fur_Table and no kiddies allowed up Restaurant
had a A_Plc_Bar A_Fur_Table and was watching some of the action in the A_Plc_Kitchen during my hour visit
Food and S_Menu appears similiar to another A_Plc_Bar, so this must be part  of a Restaurant
i remember the "foccaccia" Restaurant is really a F_FoodItem made with F_FoodItem dough and has nothing to do with the real F_FoodItem
F_Appetizer are said to be P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh cut, but Restaurant were fryers full of fries ready to dipped upon S_Delivery - so not sure about that claim
very big A_Plc_Bar and a great place to watch A_Entertainment as well
i saw a someone praise this Restaurant on facebook and i started chuckling
my wife asked me to go with her to the Restaurant a couple years ago
she was very excited until the Food actually came
that's when she said, this isn't what we S_Delivery
i said yeah F_FoodItem is less then 4 oz of F_FoodItem to share between 2 people
she said, no i meant these are the wrong F_Ingredients
i said hang on
we are O_Payment F_FI_Price for 2 cups of raw F_FoodItem, 4 oz of F_FoodItem, and F_FoodItem stock? she said well your O_Payment for the Ambience
plus F_Dessert is to die for
F_Dessert came, she said isn't this great and i said we are dipping less then a cup of F_FoodItem in Food
at the end she said you hated it, didn't you
i said baby i loved being Restaurant with you, but i have never O_Payment so much W_Price in all my life to eat every day Food and stay hungry
for the same W_Price we could have gone to any number of nice Restaurant and actually had a full Food
my wife laughed and then said yeah your right
it's a great P_A_Env_Size/little niche Restaurant idea, but once you get past all the hoopla this is Restaurant is a huge rip off
on the plus side, it's a nice romantic place with super dark A_Fur_Table
cooking your own Food gives you plenty of time to sit and talk with that Offers someone
S_Delivery F_FoodItem chow fun for Food today
F_FI_Taste was good but a little lacking as well as a bit on the greasy side
came out to about $F_FI_Price and the S_Staff size could probably feed two
i always have a good Food Restaurant and Food very well priced with an interesting S_Menu
my only thing is that it's tough with all the different Food on the A_Decor
it would be easier if all the Food on the A_Decor were on a S_Menu
Food is always P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and they have japanese comfort fare too like udon
not the O_Experience i was expecting
Food was average Service was good but overpriced
the F_FoodItem F_FI_Taste P_F_FI_CookingLevel/boiled the one good thing the fries were fab
won't be returning to this Ambience
ugh
the P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff gets O_Exp_StarsByCus but the Ambience is atrocious
A_Decor is beyond tacky, A_Places are scary, and the whole Restaurant needs an upgrade badly
yeah, sure its P_O_Pay_Price/cheap and not the mgm but the only reasons that i can think of anyone wanting to stay Restaurant is if they're really tight on budget or just want to ogle young girls in ridiculous outfits while A_Entertainment
at least the A_Places don't seem to have bedbugs
we stopped Restaurant for Food and the weather had the A_Plc_Patio closed which was a bummer
the A_Plc_Bar is great and the Food was good
everyone P_O_Experience/enjoyed their Food and had a great time
i would P_O_Experience/recommend this Restaurant after checking out the A_OutsideView stations
a small english pub tucked away in  an alley behind harris teeter
they have a huge A_OutsideView A_Places
the inside has a large community A_Fur_Table in the back for when the Restaurant gets P_A_Env_Type/crowded
they have an extensive F_Drinks selection
as far as the Food goes you have to be very careful
i have tried many things on the S_Menu and i have only been P_O_Experience/impressed by the F_FoodItem and the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
but, the F_FoodItem is the best you'll get Restaurant
the Food is also very affordable
i am not a F_FI_Religious but i am a big fan! not your typical Restaurant with its Food and so on
a lot more interesting A_LocatedArea Food
the Restaurant is not fancy but the S_Staff is really nice and the Food really interesting! went Restaurant 4 times in the last 2 months and the O_Experience is consistent
this little mexican joint has to have the best, mouth watering, orgasmic F_FoodItem tongue F_FoodItem on the face of this planet
my pastor introduced me to this Restaurant while my friend and i were starving in our little office ready to devour every thing we laid eyes on
i S_Delivery 6 F_FoodItem and i tell you it's amazing!!  the F_FoodItem are made P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh in front of your eyes and the tongue must of been braised for hours upon hours
because the F_FoodItem just melts in your mouth
matter a fact get the F_FoodItem
you'll get more F_FoodItem and is P_F_FI_Price/cheaper
with your F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem that you purchase you also receive a P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients
on the side if you want more F_FoodItem F_Ingredients or F_Ingredients, radishes, amazing F_FoodItem, they're available
if you truly want a P_F_FI_Taste/delicious F_FoodItem drop by any, i think Restaurant are 8 A_LocatedArea in phoenix?  don't eat the F_FoodItem
this Restaurant blows F_FoodItem out of the water
i have no idea how they ever received a O_Exp_StarsByCus rating
this Restaurant was below mediocre first of all it had a very distinct smell in the whole Restaurant and it was not a very F_Appetizer one that's for sure
secondly the S_Staff only came by twice once to get our S_Delivery and the second time to bring out the Food, S_Staff never bothered checking up on us or Food we actually had to flag someone else down just to get a refill
the Food was ok i S_Delivery two F_FoodItem with an F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem as well as a half S_Delivery of the F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem tasted as if they used a F_Ingredients and tossed in some unripe F_Ingredients which was very P_O_Experience/disappointing because i usually love F_FoodItem out
the F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem on the other hand were much better but still not good enough to bring me back
john had the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem Service with F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
he said the F_FoodItem itself wasn't bad but not his favorite, the F_FoodItem despite having them topped with cheese, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients were very F_FI_Quality and needed a good dash of F_Ingredients
overall you would be much more P_O_Experience/satisfied going to your A_Environment Restaurant Restaurant in my opinion
i stopped by quickly the other day before my dinner at the Restaurant for a quick F_Drinks and O_Experience a delicious F_Drinks that the S_Staff promised wouldn't F_FI_Taste like a F_Drinks and S_Staff was right
the last time i had been Restaurant was for dinner but that was probably seven years ago
a repeat visit is definitely in S_Delivery
their F_Drinks are delicious and Ambience is lively
i've been coming Restaurant for years - dating back to when it was in an old Restaurant on A_LocatedArea before they moved into the current bat cave - and the Food never P_O_Experience/disappoints
the stacked F_FoodItem are my favorite, complete with the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem on top to make everything F_FI_Quality
the Restaurant is always tender, and all of the Food pack F_FI_Quality Service is friendly
you can't come to A_LocatedArea and not eat Restaurant at least once
everything looked fun
its all broken
Food worth a damn is out of S_Delivery
waste of time
why go any where else? Food is the best on the strip, best executed,F_Drinks list rocks with interesting S_Menu, and the A_OutsideView is well, the best in A_LocatedArea
one of the few Restaurant i have stored in my phone
this particular A_LocatedArea is open 24/7
if you already know what you Food, i'd P_O_Experience/recommend calling it in, as they can get busy
as a F_FI_Religious, i'd say their F_FoodItem are amazing
F_FI_Religious is my favorite (take F_FoodItem to go and add famous F_FoodItem to it, trust me)
the F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem is awesome too, just tell them to go easy on the Restaurant, they drown it
the F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem is a garden burger patty, good if you like F_FoodItem
you can also S_Delivery the F_FoodItem with F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem
it's W_Price the F_FI_Price more than the Restaurant across the street, that's for sure
Restaurant also sell really good F_Appetizer, i'd P_O_Experience/recommend the Restaurant F_FoodItem
writing this review makes me want to S_Delivery a F_FoodItem right now!!
super P_F_FI_Taste/yummy F_FoodItem, F_Appetizer, F_FoodItem
good F_Drinks S_Menu too which seems to be a rarity in A_LocatedArea
we had to S_Del_Time about S_Del_Time at Food on a monday, so i would be prepared for a S_Del_OrderingMethod
sadly, our S_Staff was not the sharpest knife in the drawer thus taking away a O_Exp_StarsByCus rating
best F_FoodItem i've had in a long time though!oh, and Restaurant was someone famous at the A_Plc_Bar when we were Restaurant
but we were too lame or hungover to know who she was
still, it must be a good place to scope out celebs
if you can figure out who they are
being the only A_LocatedArea in A_LocatedArea the Restaurant at the A_LocatedArea automatically earns itself a positive reputation
however, the Restaurant's success and appeal are also a result of the Restaurant's fun-oriented Ambience as well as its individuality
as mentioned earlier, Restaurant is A_LocatedArea at the A_LocatedArea in tempe, a large mall different from other malls in A_LocatedArea
Restaurant are plenty of things to do Restaurant because the A_LocatedArea is home to a harkins imax movie theater and a gameworks in addition to all of the stores
the assortment of available activities makes the mall a good place to plan an entire day of events
this is exactly what my girlfriend and i did for our one-year anniversary; we started off the day with a Food at the rainforest café, strolled around the mall for a while, and then saw a movie at the harkins
all in all, it proved to be an entertaining day, and the highlight of it was our fun-filled visit to the Restaurant
the setting of the Restaurant is similar to that of an amusement A_Places rather than a regular Restaurant, and is the hibernate reason that people choose to visit Restaurant
the Restaurant was designed to look like a tropical rainforest, and is filled with A_Decor, A_Decor, and P_A_Env_Size/large A_Environment filled with A_Decor
A_Decor and A_Decor add to the wild vibe, and provide an entertaining A_Environment different from other Restaurant
because of its similarity to amusement A_Places such as disneyland, the Restaurant is popular among families and teenagers looking to have a good time
as a result, the Restaurant is often filled with P_A_Env_Type/loud, energetic children, which can be annoying but also adds to the overall mood because their antics are similar to those of the electronic gorillas that periodically cause an uproar in their of the Restaurant
besides, since most of the people dining at the Restaurant are Restaurant to have a good time, it does little to disturb their Restaurant
in terms of Service, Restaurant is just average; S_Staff often appear rushed and a little confused, which is understandable because the Restaurant is always so busy
however, S_Staff are always P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and willing to P_S_Stf_Behavior/help, making up for S_Staff overwhelmed Service
the only fault of the Restaurant is the O_Pay_Price, which is a little excessive considering that the majority of the Food are of common F_FI_Quality
but the O_Pay_Price are not so extreme that they take away from the Restaurant's appeal because the unique O_Experience offered by this Ambience is worth O_Payment a little extra
O_Exp_StarsByCus for the Restaurant
i'm being slightly generous but these O_Exp_StarsByCus make sense in context of the fact that we're talking about a Restaurant
i'm not even comparing this Restaurant with Restaurant across the street or any "honest" Restaurant, for that matter
when one accounts for the fact, though, that this is an all-you-can-eat Restaurant, Restaurant should evidently get O_Exp_StarsByCus
other reviewers have already mentioned this:  they have a wide S_Menu of different Food:  F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, Food, american, Food, Food, Food, and F_Dessert
this means you can get F_Appetizer to start with, then load up F_FoodItem, then switch over and get a F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients, then get a F_FoodItem or some F_FoodItem, and finish it up with a couple of F_Dessert
we didn't get an opportunity to try nearly that many Food Restaurant, but this is just to illustrate the S_Menu of Food that S_Staff Service
i started with Restaurant F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem, incidentally
the F_FoodItem was really extremely good
i also tasted their F_FoodItem and their F_FoodItem, and i gotta say the F_FoodItem was quite good
the F_FoodItem one
only so so
their F_FoodItem was *serious* P_O_Experience/disappointment, as was their F_FoodItem
let's just say that i didn't even touch the F_FoodItem:  my wife got it for me as she knows i love it, but just eyeing the F_FoodItem, i knew F_FoodItem was probably not even close to P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and didn't really feel like spending my vegas weekend puking, so i left it
the F_FoodItem was F_FI_CookingLevel with a F_Ingredients and was way P_F_FI_Taste/tastey!   finally, their F_Dessert S_Menu was astounding
i had the Food and it really was quite a Service!F_FI_Price a head for sunday brunch
F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Price/pricey, but then again you're gonna eat a lot of different Food and lots of it, so that'll basically be your one Food for the day
price-wise, i guess it's W_Price it
as far as A_Decor is concerned, it's quite tragic
i think i've felt more warmth kickin' it at the Restaurant men's A_Plc_RestRoom than i did in this Restaurant
it's open A_Fur_Table, very ugly A_Fur_Table
just tragic A_Decor
also, watch out for serious white trash contingency Restaurant
this couple took our A_Fur_Table and switched receipts because they apparently weren't pleased with where they'd been placed by the S_Staff
puzzled, i asked the guy who looked worse than a bulldog if he might have mistakenly sat at the wrong A_Fur_Table
he sorta grunted and went back to sucking his Food out of his S_Cutlery
the guy looked so grungy and smelly i frankly wasn't gonna argue
probably sitting back in that A_Furniture i'd have caught some nasty disease
anyway, that was a bit of a downer on our brunch since both my wife and i felt slightly freaked out at this episode
we tried to sit as far away from them as we could but, sadly, it wasn't far enough
so yeah, watch out for the white trash that seems to hang out Restaurant
then again, most of the other F_Drinks looked normal enough
still, looks can be deceiving
i do adore the weekend F_Drinks brunch, but not for the Food - for the F_Drinks, of course!  the Food
well, the Food is "eh" at best, and inedible at worst
the Food is extensive and covers nearly any palette, but because F_FoodItem done in such a mass quantity and left to sit out, is not particularly P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh or hot
the F_Dessert mostly had a rubbery consistency, Offers for the P_F_FI_Taste/tasty F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
the A_Places is also a very safe bet
steer clear of the F_FoodItem
they were room-temperature and slimy on the skin, so we had to pass after a F_Appetizer, for fear we'd get sick
most Food was heat-lamped too long and was too P_F_FI_Quality/dry to enjoy, but if my tip would be to sit at a A_Fur_Table with A_OutsideView of the Food S_Staff - you can watch them put out new Food and run over to get Food P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
Food won't F_FI_Taste P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, but at least they'll be S_Delivery straight-from-the-oven
i have heard that the dinner Food is better, but for the F_FI_Price of F_Drinks brunch, i expected that the Food F_FI_Quality would suffer, so i wasn't P_O_Experience/disappointed when this came to fruition
however, for the O_Pay_Price or whatever it was, the ability to sit in a A_Places with the A_Env_Type in, nibbling some Food and drinking F_Drinks was well W_Price the O_Pay_Price tag
it's a great way to spend a sunday morning at the Restaurant
so grab a S_Cutlery, settle in, and, if you really want good Food, stick to the fresh-made stations like the F_FoodItem, or just go somewhere else
wow!  i mean wow!  entered the S_Del_OrderingMethod at the end of the brunch/Food S_Menu so when we got to our seconds they were placing out Food!  for the Food F_FI_Price!!!! excellent savings
Service is as amazing as everything else in the wynn/encore
beautiful floral and A_Environment Ambience inside
the Food was amazing!  so many S_Menu
my favorites were: king crab legs with clarified F_Ingredients, prime F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_Healthy/freshly F_FoodItem
who am i kidding, F_FoodItem was so frickin P_F_FI_Taste/delicious!we sat right by the F_Dessert windows
i tore that up!!  gelato - F_Drinks & mango =wow yummy!  candied F_FoodItem - never been a fan, but these are really good
F_Dessert was so creamy
creme brulee with the hard shell was amazing!   can't wait to go back
so Worthiness it!
anyone from the east coast that does not visit an in and out F_FoodItem when visiting the west coast is a fool
fries and F_FoodItem
that's it and they do F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and they do them right
i rent a car just to insure i get to visit one
better than l&l, nowhere near as good as dakine's or keilani's
i used to love dave's (see previous 4 O_Exp_StarsByCus reviews from earlier this year) but something changed
the last few times i've gone Restaurant the Food is not as good as it used to be and the Service is slipping as well
turnover in help? change in S_Staff? just another got-too-big-for-our-britches story? your guess is as good as mine
first it was the F_FoodItem, instead of being P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, tender and juicy, F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm and P_F_FI_Quality/dried_out, as if F_FoodItem had been left under a heat lamp or P_F_FI_CookingLevel/reheated in a microwave
the baby back F_FoodItem used to be P_F_FI_Healthy/fat and meaty, lately they are lean and P_F_FI_Healthy/fatty/P_F_FI_Quality/tough
then the Service started to be less than friendly and careless, twice i received the wrong S_Delivery and had to return to get it fixed
the last time i went Restaurant, figuring i'd give it another try as S_Staff has "off" days, was the final straw
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Quality/dried_out and F_FI_Quality, the F_FoodItem were soured (gone bad, gone over, whatever)
as if F_FoodItem had been not P_F_FI_CookingLevel/refrigerated and stored properly and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/reheated many times over
i was sick from eating just two bites
the F_Ingredients was full of tough inedible F_FoodItem stalk pieces (either someone just doesn't care or they are really cutting F_FI_Price) and an overabundance of F_Ingredients which overwhelmed the usually sweet/hot balance of the F_FoodItem
having a bad day is one thing, bad Food that makes people sick is entirely a different animal and is indicative of a more serious issue going on at the Restaurant
Restaurant is absolutely no excuse for Food improperly stored or F_FI_CookingLevel that is full of bacteria
famous dave
please wake up and fix your process before it's too late!!!
this used to be my favorite Restaurant for F_FoodItem for years
i'm talking O_Exp_StarsByCus as far as F_FoodItem joints go
then last week, i saw the S_Staff use the F_Ingredients to finish up my Food, right after he had just used the same F_Ingredients to put raw F_FoodItem on the F_FoodItem!!! i have friends who are S_Staff and they would be fired for doing exactly that in most Restaurant
cross contamination isn't taken lightly by me and i will never give Restaurant Food to my kids
** i've contacted Restaurant and they wrote back saying they'll take care of it
whatever that means
as for the Food, Restaurant give you a lot of bang for the buck
machaca F_FoodItem or F_FoodItem has shredded F_FoodItem with two P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem in it
it's loaded with F_FoodItem and it's only F_FI_Price
their F_FoodItem is loaded with pickled jalapeños & F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, radishes, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients & F_Ingredients
F_FoodItem kept P_F_FI_Quality/clean and P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
one of Restaurant sons once told me that this Restaurant is their A_Env_Type, hence it's open 24 hrs and is very clean
that's why i was shocked to see what i saw in the A_Plc_Kitchen
their ayce is pretty good Restaurant
Service is sometimes slow, but i keep coming Restaurant so it's not that bad! Food a bit P_O_Pay_Price/pricey, but they offer some pretty good options
i've liked most things that i've had Restaurant with the exception of F_FoodItem (which was an error in my part for S_Delivery it from a F_FoodItem Restaurant!!)
i love their F_FoodItem, i get it everytime!!
i'm not really a fan of Restaurant but i can't help liking a Restaurant that plays nonstop country A_Ent_Music (that said, i can totally understand why someone who doesn't love country music would go a bit nuts Restaurant)
i also like deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem
i came Restaurant with a bunch of girls from work who share the same love of all things country A_Ent_Music (i grew up line A_Entertainment to brooks and dunn if that explains anything
and yes, i know i'm asian and it's weird)
we were Restaurant for hours and hours
the A_Ent_Music was good, they played all the current country songs and some older stuff too
Restaurant was definitely a variety of people Restaurant and it is great people watching
my deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
i think if it were at a bigger A_Entertainment that i like to frequent more, i would P_O_Experience/come_back more often
i've been Restaurant a few times and enjoy the Food, usually a packed Restaurant during Food
i went in Restaurant last night and got a F_FoodItem with F_Ingredients, F_Appetizer and a F_Drinks
first of all, this Restaurant is f___g filthy, i mean the worst i've ever seen at a Restaurant
i'm not a clean freak by any means, and Restaurant's no way i'd let my kid play in that A_Places
it looked filthy, can you imagine how much shit Restaurant is that you can't see?  and i mean that literally too
A_Environment overflowing, A_Places with trash all over the A_Environment, dirty A_Fur_Table, etc
and to top it off, i could tell that my F_FoodItem had been sitting around for hours because it was almost like eating sandpaper
i ended up throwing it away, and throwing Food away is not something i do very often, that's for sure
F_Appetizer were good and fresh though, at least Restaurant's that
i love this Restaurant it's the best! great Food and O_Experience for friends and family
if your hungry for some ny style F_FoodItem come Restaurant
love the Food and S_Staff, only thing is the Food can be a bit P_F_FI_Price/pricey at times for a Restaurant
i'm a regular Restaurant
i usually eat in Restaurant with my family and the customer Service is great
the sitting area is awesome
the A_Fur_Table and A_Fur_Table are very comfortable
their F_Drinks is amazing, just wish they didn't put so much F_Ingredients in it
don't S_Delivery to spict because medium is already really really hot for me i couldn't eat it, unless you're obsessed with P_F_FI_Taste/spicy Food go for it! the F_Appetizer is so good
i usually S_Delivery their F_Appetizer with F_FoodItem and two S_Delivery of F_FoodItem
i do take out Restaurant a lot and every time i get Restaurant within the S_Del_Time they said it would be ready i never had to S_Del_Time for my Food for a long S_Del_Time! they understand and speak english very well
the S_Staff look very P_S_Stf_Appearance/neat and P_S_Stf_Appearance/cleanly
the Restaurant itself is very clean with an a O_Exp_StarsByCus
it's at a great A_LocatedArea, on A_Environment and A_Environment
it is A_LocatedArea in the A_LocatedArea where the starbucks is, and next to a flower Restaurant
went Restaurant for a late night F_FoodItem craving and S_Delivery F_FoodItem,F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem,  F_Drinks, wth, F_Drinks and the F_FoodItem
the F_FoodItem was good,  our F_FoodItem F_FoodItem where P_F_FI_Size/small and P_F_FI_Size/thin compared the P_F_FI_Size/big P_F_FI_Size/thick cuts of F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
all the F_FoodItem were very good,  F_FoodItem could have been sliced a tad bit P_F_FI_Size/thinner,   all the cuts were about an inch thick
definitely not bit F_FI_Size pieces but it sure didn't fall apart
the Food overall i would have to give it a 4 O_Exp_StarsByCus
the reason it got demoted to O_Exp_StarsByCus is due to the fact that the O_Payment came out with gratuity of O_Pay_Price on a O_Payment of O_Pay_Price before tax
i understand the need for yours automatic gratuity charge and it is usually used for parties of 6 or more
but it was only a party of 2!!!!
very P_O_Experience/unsatisfied with the Food
Service was great, but our F_FoodItem and double F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_CookingLevel/burnt - not to mention the fries were just dabbed with seasoning in the middle and not spread out, cold too
i used to enjoy coming to their café for their graveyard Offers, but now it seems the F_FI_CookingLevel is different
i don't really P_O_Experience/recommend coming for a quick F_Appetizer to eat Restaurant
we aren't huge fans of Restaurant Restaurant, but this is one of the couple Restaurant we do frequent
it was the F_Drinks that brought us in and probably what keeps us P_O_Experience/coming_back
Offers is a good time to come and it goes until 6:30 where a lot of Restaurant stop at 6!  get the F_Appetizer if you are a lover of F_FoodItem
other good S_Menu are the pulled F_FoodItem F_FoodItem or the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_FoodItem!   Service is hit or miss at this A_LocatedArea, but never so bad that we haven't wanted to return
this Restaurant is awesome! the O_Pay_Price are reasonable (not dirt cheap but certainly fair) and the Service is quick
i often go to a F_FoodItem Restaurant by my work which--despite being less busy--always take too long to get my Food! they don't offer too much other than F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem  so don't go Restaurant if you want something else
most importantly the Food tasted amazing! the F_Appetizer were the best in my opinion so i highly P_O_Experience/recommend trying them!
we used to go Restaurant every other weekend, then about 3 weeks ago something changed
what happened to S_Staff? it's way too rowdy of a place for 4 security guards, especially on the weekend! the last 2 weekends have been scary! fights inside and A_OutsideView of the A_Plc_Bar, someone's going to get hurt! it's no fun watching your back the whole time you're supposed to be drinking
we won't P_O_Experience/be_back unless they return to the responsible S_Staff!
the Food was good, but way P_F_FI_Price/overpriced
i really like the concept of no S_Menu with a Food for sides and S_Staff that come around offering you F_FoodItem
i felt bad for the S_Staff who had F_FoodItem since i imagine many people decline F_FoodItem in favor of the F_Ingredients and various F_FoodItem S_Menu
however, it was $37/ person which is definitely overpriced for the F_FI_Quality of the Food considering you can get a much higher F_FI_Quality Food for a similar F_FI_Price at Restaurant or Restaurant
i would only P_O_Experience/recommend going Restaurant if you are extremely hungry and you really want to be able to eat right away without having to S_Del_Time to place an S_Delivery
i don't plan on returning despite the beautiful Ambience and P_S_Staff/friendly S_Staff
every once in a while Restaurant can kind of hit the spot
but i'm not quite as crazy about it as some locals seems to be
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem are good and P_F_FI_Price/cheap; and their special F_Ingredients is pretty damn P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
but i usually leave feeling a little fishy and greased out
the F_FoodItem is perfectly square, and i can't help but wonder why they do it that way
because it really gives off a 'store bought' vibe
compare this to somewhere like F_FoodItem in Restaurant which has P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh pieces of F_FoodItem that each kind of form their own twisted and unique shape
it just feels more authentic that way
this just feel like a F_FoodItem that could have been taken out of a Restaurant F_FoodItem and thrown in the greaser
so what i gotta say about Restaurant is this: only go if you're craving some F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem; and if you have such a craving you'll probably leave happy
if however you are looking for Food to make your F_FI_Taste buds shiver with excitement, then look Restaurant
oh yeah
one last thing
Restaurant whole sense of entitlement really gets on my nerves sometimes
having kooky rules at a Restaurant is fun, but it only works if that Restaurant is Service up magnificent Food
Restaurant you are getting average Food and S_Staff try to make you feel like they are the gods of F_FoodItem and you must bow down and obey their every command if you want to get Service (like their whole "no ketchup-don't even ask" thing)
you better be careful Restaurant or you may find people are gonna find Restaurant with better Food, that doesn't hassle you if you ask for F_Ingredients
meh
absolutely terrible
i would give this place O_Exp_StarsByCus if i could
i was with a group of 6 other people and none of us P_O_Experience/enjoyed our Food
the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem (a staple at any mexican Food Restaurant) was a far cry from pretty much any other Restaurant in the A_LocatedArea (mexican and otherwise)
as for the F_FI_Price, i would put these Food (and Food Offers, even) on the "P_F_FI_Price/expensive" side of the scale
the Service was acceptable, although i can only suspect the S_Del_Time S_Staff expects large tips from their hugely inflated O_Payment
sadly, Restaurant may not get any return customers with the F_FI_Quality of their Food the way it is
well, folks, based on the review by teri c, we thought we would go over and try it
alas, they are closed for good
we are not locals but were just passing through so i don't know if this was a victim of the recession or what
but, i do know it is closed and abandoned,what a shame, it is a beautiful Ambience
jim
i'm visiting madison and went Restaurant for Food- it was terrific! i got the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem (it's october, after all) and F_FoodItem was sooo P_F_FI_Taste/tasty! not too sweet, perfectly filling, and reasonably F_FI_Price
the S_Staff was P_S_Staff/friendly and the A_Places was really cute
i'd make this a regular morning stop if i lived A_LocatedArea!
i have been wanting to go to their A_LocatedArea A_LocatedArea, but because katrina m
has a groupon for this A_LocatedArea we stopped by for brunch before S_Staff had to work
when we entered, the restaurant was steady but not busy
we sat down at the A_Fur_Table the S_Staff just cleaned off and were P_S_Stf_Behavior/greeted with S_Menu
wanting to avoid any hassles we showed the Offers and got that out of the way
from that point on, it did not feel like we were top priority, but we were not ignored completely either
katrina m
was in the mood for F_FoodItem and turned it into a F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem for a F_FI_Price more
the F_FoodItem was ok, a little soft for my F_FI_Taste
i have been craving a F_FoodItem melt with P_F_FI_CookingLevel/grilled F_FoodItem, so i jumped on that
i also chose a bowl of F_Appetizer for my side
the F_Appetizer was light
the F_FoodItem was F_FI_CookingLevel to a perfect medium rare and juicy
maybe it was a little too juicy because my rye F_FoodItem was soggy
i love that S_Staff do not fry the F_FoodItem in a ton of oil to make it crispy, but the second half of my F_FoodItem had sopped up all the F_FoodItem F_Drinks before i could get to it
the O_Experience was not bad, just not something i would drive across town for
is it better than your Restaurant place? yes
is it the best F_FoodItem ever? no way! but Restaurant Food is decent
Food is P_F_FI_Price/cheap F_FoodItem and pulled F_FoodItem are good, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem good
went in the other day because i didn't want to cook, and after watching "super size me'" about a month ago, i stay away from the obvious "fast food" Restaurant completely
so, craving some red meat i went to Restaurant for S_Del_OrderingMethod because it was close and i figured Restaurant Food wouldn't be as processed as Restaurant- seriously that movie gave me nightmares
the S_Staff was super P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly, the football A_Entertainment was on A_Ent_Tv
, the Food was done S_Del_Time- giving me enough S_Del_Time to make myself a root F_Drinks float and watch az lose in ot- :( for 3 of us i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem, the F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, mac and F_FoodItem, P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and 2 F_FoodItem
when i got home i was P_O_Experience/disappointed to see that the F_FoodItem looked like processed poo on a S_Cutlery
really S_Staff- A_Decor slimy poo on a S_Cutlery-it was that gross! i refused to F_FI_Taste it, and everyone else was brave enough to at least try it, only to decide they couldn't eat more than 1 bite- but the dog thought F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
never tried the potato casserole because Restaurant forgot to pack it
the mac and F_FoodItem was gross! i'm not a F_Ingredients person, but it definitely needed F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients to give it F_FI_Taste and the F_FoodItem was over cooked to that gross slimy F_FoodItem consistency
so, the 3 of us shared 4 F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and an individual F_FI_Size F_FoodItem with 2 F_FoodItem- one person was hungry enough to go ahead and eat the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem even though he didn't like it
Restaurant would have gotten O_Exp_StarsByCus but the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem were pretty darn good and i made one hell of a root F_Drinks float while i was Restaurant
i may be seen in Restaurant again because i have a fondness for P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem and i have tried their pulled F_FoodItem F_FoodItem before and liked it
but i will definitely check my Food before i leave to make sure it is all Restaurant and i will never S_Delivery the mac and F_FoodItem or processed F_FoodItem poo again
amazing Restaurant!  stumbled by it one day and made O_Reservation to go Restaurant the week after
what a nice concept
the A_Decor is also very homey and makes you feel instantly very comfortable
it helps that the S_Staff don't seem to be in a rush at all since they're all volunteers
even your tip goes to charity!! and of course the Food was actually amazing
they change their S_Menu from time to time so the same S_Menu are not always available but if you get a chance to try their lentil dahl, do it
it was hands down the most P_F_FI_Taste/flavourful and spiced-F_FoodItem i've ever tasted
mmm my mouth is watering just thinking about it
after that, i S_Delivery the F_FoodItem which was pretty good
the presentation was very nice
another compliment to the F_FoodItem!  so crunchy on the A_OutsideView but soft on the inside - the way F_FoodItem is supposed to be
i went with some F_FoodItem (who apparently are F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients experts, or so they claim) and they confirmed that it was, indeed, F_FoodItem of excellent F_FI_Quality
we asked them to refill the F_FoodItem about 3 times and at the end, our S_Staff was so sweet and gave us a doggy-bag for the remainder in our basket
Restaurant made both my stomach and heart happy
found this Restaurant through yelp and was not P_O_Experience/disappointed
had the F_FoodItem platter and Food was excellent
in my short trip in montreal i tried 2 other Restaurant lebanese places and this one was definitely the best
(comes with F_FoodItem, pickled/shredded F_FoodItem, other F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, and a piece of F_FoodItem)  the best part of the entire O_Experience was conversing with mr
boustan about montreal and hearing him drop knowledge on some mcgill students about the merits of keeping up with class in the short term so they can go out/party/relax on the night before the exam
apparently he did this when he was in engineering school
did not see any single person walking around passing out passes to go to Restaurant
walked in to grab the Offers during Food time, called in the afternoon to be put on the guestlist without any promoter's name, and showed up at night and got in less than 3 minute S_Del_Time thru guestlist line
Restaurant is 1 particular Offers that also gives you a Offers
you have to look for it though
because Restaurant's like 4 different version of free admission passes and Restaurant's only one that gives u a free F_Drinks
Restaurant was very generous with their comp drink rule - Restaurant was none! you could have Food they had on hand
most other Restaurant have that stupid rule that only well F_Drinks apply to comp drinks =p so take advantage of it with your pass
the A_Places itself was a lot smaller than i thought, but i still liked the feel
pretty chill, nice A_Plc_Bar, the nicest S_Staff - (yes
much P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendlier than the ones at blush in the wynn who were snobs and even nicer than xs S_Staff) who won't hesitate to P_S_Stf_Behavior/help you out with F_Drinks options
the dance floor is quite small
but it works
and finally, they have the most awesome A_Plc_Bathroom ever
i absolutely loved it
it reminded me of some enchanted castle restroom or something, with their lion-head sinks
hahaall in all, xs is better
but lavo is a great alternative to the others (better than pure, the bank, etc)
this is one of those few Restaurant that never seams to fail in all aspects
their Food is flawlessly perfect, the F_FI_Price is great, their Service is prompt and everything looks clean and fresh
i highly recomend going for their sunday brunch
very P_O_Experience/disappointed in this Restaurant
got a S_Del_OrderingMethod S_Delivery and when got it home
it was disgusting
only got the F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients with side of F_FoodItem
when S_Delivery my husband told them F_FoodItem only no F_Ingredients
well basically thats all it was and i am highly allergic to F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem were maybe 5 to 6 very very small pieces of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem had been very P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked
couldn't even chew it
needless to say i was very upset called and talked to S_Staff his only comment
when you come back in next S_Del_Time i will give you some F_FoodItem
what the heck
like that's going to happen
hands down best Food Restaurant in A_LocatedArea!! the Food was absolutely P_F_FI_Taste/delicious and everything i wanted
my favorite were the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
the customer Service was outstanding!! the S_Staff were so P_S_Stf_Behavior/welcoming and P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
will be returning again tomorrow and everytime i come visit vegas
make O_Reservation, the S_Del_Time Restaurant can get pretty long
the F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! i S_Delivery the F_Ingredients F_FoodItem on rye and it was soooooo huge and sooooo Worthiness
try the F_FoodItem sangrias! get a Food! to yourself! lol but seriously, their F_FoodItem are very F_FI_Quality, very F_FI_Taste
and ofcourse, the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen hot chocolate is a must try
this Restaurant was great
the F_FI_Price are amazing, the Service is friendly, and the Food is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
this is not Restaurant or margaritaville
mexican food and new mexican food are two different F_FI_Taste
it's not suppose to have tons of F_Ingredients and F_Ingredients like Food does
it's the F_FI_Taste of the P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_Ingredients and the hot F_Ingredients that makes this Food amazing
the reviews that said the Food was bland, are just use to dousing their Food in F_Ingredients
my fiance is from new mexico so it was a relief to find a place where you can take home P_F_FI_CookingLevel/frozen F_Ingredients and F_FoodItem
we also S_Delivery our 4 dozen F_FoodItem for christmas
everyone needs to give this Restaurant a shot
we will be going Restaurant at least twice a week from now on
very Food falafal and the F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh
the Food was particularly P_F_FI_Taste/delicious! the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem flavor really carried through
went Restaurant for a birthday celebration, and i have to say i was P_O_Experience/impressed! the party was on the A_Plc_Patio upstairs, and while the weather was unusually chilly and windy for a spring evening, the heat lamps and the rocking A_Places kept me warm
we started off the evening right with an array of F_Appetizer, including F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem fingers w/ a side of fries, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem & F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
F_FoodItem F_FoodItem- P_F_FI_Size/large pieces of F_FoodItem tossed with P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem and red F_FoodItem marinated in P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh squeezed F_Ingredients
Service with homemade F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem F_Ingredients and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/warm tortilla F_FoodItem
a little difficult to eat, but refreshing & light nonetheless
F_FoodItem fingers- P_F_FI_Size/large pieces of juicy white F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_FoodItem & P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried to ultra crispy perfection
the F_FoodItem were awesome as well, crunchy on the outside & fluffy in the inside
so bad for you, but so P_F_FI_Taste/yummy
calamari- freshly F_FoodItem calamari Service with house cajun remoulade and F_FoodItem F_Ingredients
my least favorite F_Appetizer of the night
i wish the F_FoodItem was more crunchy & less P_F_FI_Healthy/oily
F_FoodItem- homemade tortilla F_FoodItem topped with F_FoodItem & F_FoodItem, jack and cheddar F_FoodItem, fresh pico de gallo, F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem and F_Ingredients
Service with freshly made F_FoodItem
the portion F_FI_Size is ginormous, enough to feed a whole family and then some (i kid you not!)
to wash all this Food down, i F_Drinks an F_Drinks (adios
), which was strong and sweet
by this point, i was stuffed beyond belief & ready to pass out, but the A_Ent_Music started playing A_Ent_Music to which i had to get up & A_Entertainment to to burn some of the millions of calories i had just consumed
some of the A_Entertainment were good, while the other A_Ent_Music made me wonder, but in the end, my friends & i had a fantastic night
the Food and F_Drinks were good, the S_Staff were awesome and on point, and the A_Ent_Music that came later on in the night played some cool dance jams
needless to say, i had a great S_Del_Time Restaurant and can't wait to come back to play a couple rounds of skee ball at the A_Plc_DiningRoom!
very P_O_Experience/disappointing O_Experience
we went for dinner on a sunday evening and arrived at the Restaurant around 5:15 pm
we had been looking forward to S_Del_OrderingMethod some pho but were informed that about 70% of the Food listed on the S_Menu were not available (including any pho)
the Food we S_Delivery very ok but not good enough to leave a lasting impression
in addition, the Restaurant did not accept our restaurant
com gift certificate and also does not accept O_Pay_Method
time to look for another vietnamese Restaurant with better Service and Food
my jaw dropped as i walked into this amazing store! this store holds products that not every generic supermarket has
i felt as though it was a combination of vons, 99 F_Ingredients market and cardenas all rolled into one amazing store! S_Staff and culinary students (like myself) could find F_Ingredients you need to make an exquisite Food!
modern F_FoodItem in scottsdale is at 7014 east camelback road, but you'll know it better as scottsdale fashion square (aka: bmw's overflow lot)
modern F_FoodItem is part of fox Restaurant concepts, who are known for some highly acclaimed eateries: bloom, F_FoodItem & ivy, north, the greene house, et al
i'm usually not a corporate Food guy, but fox rc knows what the hell they are doing, so i was all on board with giving modern F_FoodItem a try
dinner the Restaurant is P_A_Env_Size/big and very bold
lots of A_Decor, accented with A_Decor and A_Decor
the A_Decor is very busy, but it works
the A_Plc_Bar area is a nice size with just enough flat panels to satisfy your curiosity on the A_Entertainment, without spoiling the aesthetic of the Restaurant
A_Fur_Table in the hibernate dining area is varied: A_Fur_Table, long A_Fur_Table bench A_Fur_Table, corner A_Fur_Table, and some smaller A_Fur_Table that mimic eating A_OutsideView (but you're really in the mall)
personally, i'd take a pass on having people watch me eat as they walk back from donating a kidney in exchange for some new duds at barney's
the F_Drinks list is fairly small for a Restaurant of this caliber with maybe 30 F_Drinks total, but they are almost all available by the glass
most of the bottles range from about 2x - 3x retail F_FI_Price
their idea of a "reserve list" consists of two F_Drinks that are both O_Pay_Price a glass
they are both very good F_Drinks, but then again, at O_Pay_Price a glass they should be
i settled on a glass of F_Drinks that was O_Pay_Price
it's F_Drinks from the ca central coast that has nicely rounded tannins and a smooth, smoky finish
those of you thinking the S_Menu is all about Food will be in for a surprise as Restaurant are a lot of Food Food available
but lovers of the cow won't be upset as F_FoodItem does live up to its name with about a dozen F_FoodItem S_Menu
unsurprisingly, the Food mostly come without any sides, so any Food you want will be a la carte
i spied F_FoodItem amongst the sides and knew immediately they would be part of the Food
Restaurant is what we S_Delivery:F_FoodItem - this was simply amazing! four colossal shrimp, F_FI_CookingLevel perfectly then chilled
Service with a F_Ingredients infused F_FoodItem F_Ingredients and some small F_Ingredients (maybe micro arugula?)
it was a perfect start to the Food
F_FoodItem short F_FoodItem with F_Drinks and Food - this was a very well executed Food
the short F_FoodItem was very tender and just melted in your mouth
the F_FoodItem were F_FI_CookingLevel perfectly and the F_Ingredients had just enough F_FoodItem without overpowering the S_Cutlery
the jus was a perfect accent to the Food and mixed well with the F_FoodItem F_Ingredients
they also split the S_Delivery onto two S_Cutlery for us without being asked (always a plus)
F_FoodItem truffle fries - these kind of speak for themselves
thin F_Appetizer married with F_Ingredients oil and F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
perfectly crispy and just a delight to pop in your mouth
they come with "house made F_Ingredients"
when i heard that, all i could think of was chevy chase in vacation: "ooooh, real F_Ingredients, eddie???"  this F_Ingredients was much better than that, but still seemed lacking
we ended up getting a side of the homemade F_Ingredients dressing to dip them in instead
nothing but high class at our A_Fur_Table
sauteed F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem - we were lacking greenery at the A_Fur_Table, so we also S_Delivery a side of the F_FoodItem
it was F_FI_CookingLevel ok, but seemed a little bland
they also cut the spears into 2 inch pieces, which doesn't hurt the flavor, but it looked odd
all in all, a pretty forgettable side Food
final takemodern F_FoodItem continues the trend of a high F_FI_Quality Restaurant run by fox rc
the Food S_Menu are solid and the Service is very good
the A_LocatedArea is great, so they will probably keep themselves pretty busy between the mall crowd and people walking over old town
i will P_O_Experience/be_back because i want to try their F_FoodItem (you can S_Delivery it in the Restaurant or from a "to go" A_Furniture that you access from inside the mall)
the S_Menu options are not cheap, but i feel you get a F_FI_Quality Food for the F_FI_Price
overall grade = b+ (very good)the ev foodie
i ended up trying this five guys again due to a large family outing and i was pleasantly P_O_Experience/surprised by the F_FoodItem being good!!  all eight people agreed the Food was good!
we love this Restaurant, so it's difficult to be unbiased about my review
first, Restaurant's no illusion Restaurant, this is, as the red necks say, a F_FoodItem camp, so don't be surprised when your flatware arrives in a plastic bag
the S_Menu has its share of deeply P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem fare and your side S_Menu include the also P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried, F_Appetizer and F_Appetizer
however, once you make your way past the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried with P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried Food, Restaurant is a great broiled section, that offers a S_Menu of F_FoodItem and Food broiled to perfection with some nice seasoning
although your S_Menu of non-fried sides is limited, you can find a moderately F_FI_Healthy Food Restaurant
i always get the broiled F_FoodItem and although one of the more P_F_FI_Price/expensive Food on the S_Menu, F_FoodItem is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, filling, and not "break the bank" P_F_FI_Price/expensive
but before you get too full, remember to leave A_Plc_DiningRoom for the crazy F_Dessert! you cannot leave without picking up a slice, even if it is to take home
we are talking about a F_Ingredients topped F_FoodItem made up of individual layers of Food, F_Ingredients, F_Ingredients, and F_FoodItem jam topped F_Ingredients F_FoodItem - that's right 4 layers, each with their complementary frostings holiding it together
the kitsch of this Restaurant is everywhere, from the porthole shaped A_Furniture, to the nets and seashells hanging up on the dining A_Places
the S_Staff is always P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly, your glass is always full and the Restaurant just has a sort of feel good F_FI_Quality about it that is difficult to explain
went Restaurant twice and S_Delivery a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, something i never get
it was truly exceptional and decent F_FI_Size
i ate the second half the next day
the crock of F_FoodItem and the F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem S_Cutlery are well done
i can't say Food for the F_Drinks S_Menu, as i only had a moscato
i suspect the S_Staff hope to make their profit on the F_Drinks, since the glass was notably small
yes, i know a F_Drinks perhaps should be Service in a flute
a solid and affordable Restaurant to eat
the Restaurant seems to have a lot of anxious young men working the A_Places, but we got a warm and engaging foodie S_Staff the first time
S_Staff should get a raise for improving the Ambience
my favorite ramen spot S_Staff in vegas
their slow P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted F_FoodItem is the best
nice Ambience
great F_FI_Taste Food
filling
easy on the wallet
best F_FoodItem ever! we love the Food, the S_Staff, and did i mention the Food
we have had to cut back from having it every weekend because it was helping is gain some unwanted weight lol but everyone we introduce to Restaurant loves it and becomes a loyal follower as well
what a delicious surprise at the mesa A_Decor festival!  i have been dreaming of a Restaurant to get a F_FI_Religious F_FoodItem with interesting and mouth F_Drinks F_Ingredients for as long  as i can remember!  i was a little P_O_Experience/surprised when i was handed my F_FoodItem F_FoodItem in F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, but it was better than a F_FoodItem
i will be tracking this one down again and again!
fancy Restaurant - good Food & good Service
love this Restaurant!! i work just down the street so atleast two times a week i meet the wife and kids for Food
Restaurant is a nice place area for the kiddos, great Food and  great Service!! landon is the man!!!
i'd give it a O_Exp_StarsByCus if i could
it's a good Food, but i don't really feel like i have to P_O_Experience/go_back
i really wanted to like this place, i love F_FoodItem and the S_Staff working (the S_Staff?) was great - P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly, P_S_Stf_Behavior/enthusiastic and seemed to really want to bring the new england O_Experience to vegas
i thought the Restaurant itself was ok - their blasting A_Env_AC was a nice escape from the summer heat
A_Fur_Table were really padded and super comfy
i thought it was cute that they had their condiment bottles in F_FI_Quality 6pack carriers
i got the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem F_FoodItem for F_FI_Price i didn't expect too much for the F_FI_Price and it wasn't the best, but wasn't bad
the F_FoodItem was good - perfectly F_Ingredients and P_F_FI_CookingLevel/toasted, he said they just started shipping the F_FoodItem in from i think maine? so like i said, they do care and they are trying
i love that they had F_FoodItem, i'm sick of this whole shoestring fries thing so many places have going on
F_Appetizer remind me of elementary school Food - the O_Exp_StarsByCus of every craptastic Food
also had the P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried F_FoodItem F_Appetizer O_Pay_Price i can't remember
they were pretty good - a decent A_Places, hand F_FoodItem w panko
Restaurant may need to change their oil because it had a weird after-F_FI_Taste like F_FI_Quality oil
i'm honestly not sure that i'll P_O_Experience/be_back
Restaurant been open long enough to work out the kinks, but the reviews are mostly the same - ok but not great when this is a Restaurant specializing in F_FoodItem
the Service is good at Food and the Service is good at dinner
the F_FoodItem is amazing! so many options to make a pie even if you're watching your diet
we go 2 or 3 tuesdays a month and always try to sit A_OutsideView at the A_Plc_Bar
the A_Plc_Patio is great! another Restaurant i'd highly P_O_Experience/suggest!
love this Restaurant!  best thai in charlotte
we go weekly and are never P_O_Experience/disappointed
pad kaprow and pad prik are among my favorites
wait S_Staff is excellent
i had a serious fight with my gf and after we had dinner Restaurant, she's totally happy now ;) we were told Restaurant was S_Del_Time S_Del_Time,    but we were called in less than S_Del_Time
super P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly S_Staff, Food was P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and authentic
compared to the other ayce F_FoodItem this one is definitely the best
we tried all the F_Dessert and all were fantastic! not too sweet
uni was fresh
favorite Restaurant in vegas!!
i visit this place over the weekend to give them a second chance since last time the Food S_Staff is lack of training and very bad attitude not precise with S_Staff Food and still the same even worse this time!!!
finally somewhere else for S_Staff around the downtown area to eat besides the court Restaurant!! pretty good Food, but the F_FI_Price are a tad expensive (O_Pay_Price for F_FoodItem, drunken F_FoodItem, or pad-see-ew) but i can understand because of it's A_LocatedArea right across from insert coins
however, i do like the Food though; it's well made with just the right amount of F_Ingredients (fyi the F_Ingredients level is from 1-5 with 2 being medium)
if you are going for take out this place usually takes about S_Del_Time
to prepare Food, but it's worth the S_Del_Time in my opinion
highly P_O_Experience/recommend F_FoodItem pad-see-ew and F_FoodItem drunken F_FoodItem ($2 extra for F_FoodItem)
great place for Food!!
the Food covered F_FoodItem F_FoodItem did not have P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem, it had preserves
i wish their S_Menu had said that it is F_FoodItem preserve
neither my hubby or i liked this place
our Food was not P_F_FI_Taste/tasty- we were thinking, "jeez-i'm O_Payment someone to F_FI_CookingLevel this??" and although my hub liked his F_Drinks, i didn'tike mine
we'll go elsewhere
F_FoodItem works has become my go-to place for Food when i don't wish to stray far from my A_Environment
the A_Decor is reminiscent of a greasy spoon with dark and uninspiring bland A_Decor
the Ambience doesn't do much to perk one's F_Appetizer and mood during Food
on the condiment tray, Restaurant's a smiley F_FoodItem and a frowny F_FoodItem graphic that indicates whether or not you require more Service
a, get their attention
the Service can be friendly or you can also end up with a snooty S_Staff that tells you they don't do the frowning F_FoodItem anymore
well, why do you put it on the A_Fur_Table then?can't give an opinion on their Food Food but their F_FoodItem are pretty good
overall, the Food is decent and the banana F_FoodItem that comes with some Food will be bringing you back
honestly, i've had better
way better
ellis island is off the strip and can be difficult to get a taxi back from, the A_Fur_Table is your typical sticky wooden A_Fur_Table, and the F_FoodItem is usually P_F_FI_CookingLevel/overcooked and by no means great F_FI_Quality
but for some reason, every vegas trip of mine has to include a drunken trip Restaurant at 4 am for $5
99 F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
sometimes 2 in 1 night for those friends of mine that are so drunk they forgot they went the first S_Del_Time around
and for the price, your drunk self will be happy eating the home style fries and soaking up the runny F_FoodItem F_FoodItem with some F_Ingredients toast
i sure am every S_Del_Time
my first S_Del_Time trying this place
it was a toss up between it and a subway with one O_Exp_StarsByCus ratings
it wasn't a very difficult decision
Restaurant was another F_Drinks Restaurant when i entered
i took a look at the S_Menu and knew i'd be coming Restaurant for Food on a daily basis
i S_Delivery a P_F_FI_CookingLevel/toasted Food F_FoodItem which i'm eating now
F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Taste/delicious!
my husband and i travelled from york, sc to meet friends for a concert uptown on thursday evening
one of the couples we were joining made a O_Reservation for six at the roosters uptown A_LocatedArea
in the spirit of full disclosure, four of us arrived 15 minutes late to join the third couple at our reserved A_Fur_Table
we entered the bank of america complex on the wrong side and took a scenic tour of several catwalks, escalator banks and retail corridors in our quest to find the Restaurant!  we were definitely late, and we accept responsibility for that
however, a note to rooster's:(1) if you A_Fur_Table us, you are implying that it is within your professional capacity to serve us in a timely manner
(2) if it is apparent that you are in the midst of a rush you were inadequately prepared to handle, please alert the F_Drinks arriving 15 S_Del_Time late to their O_Reservation that it is in their best interest to Restaurant elsewhere
(3) if your S_Staff is so far in the weeds to be unable, in retrospect, to take F_Appetizer S_Delivery within the first 1/2 S_Del_Time of the O_Experience (let alone Food selections), simply be apologetic and bring our checks when they are requested
snarky, P_S_Stf_Behavior/rude S_Staff reflect very poorly on the managerial S_Staff of any Ambience
as far as the actual dining A_Plc_DiningRoom and the tiny sampling of the S_Menu we accomplished:(1) the Ambience is fantastic
in an area surrounded by modern, sleek and minimalist designs, roosters manages to carve out a tiny niche reminiscent of a converted farmhouse, complete with lowered Ambience, weathered wood A_Fur_Table and beautiful iron chandeliers
the Restaurant felt intimate and casual but with an elegant touch
(2) the skinny F_Drinks F_Drinks was perfect
fresh lime pulp added just enough tartness
full flavor, F_Ingredients cold, and delicious
(3) the F_Drinks selection was fairly good and was Service very cold
the S_Staff offered an excellent suggestion to my husband when his first S_Menu was not available
(4) the F_FoodItem is hardy, with a nutty flavor - paired with the dipping oil it is a wonderful start to what could have been a rich and tasty dinner
(5) only negative; the F_Drinks was strangely metallic and, well
yucky
a little pricey? sure
but the Food is P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, and the Ambience is quite unique
the szechuan F_FoodItem belly was a great starting F_Appetizer, the F_Drinks list was W_Price impressive than i was expecting, and the F_FoodItem with F_FoodItem was perfectly tender and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious - despite the understandable skepticism about smoked and then P_F_FI_CookingLevel/roasted
and because i'm a huge sucker who can't say 'no' to a F_Dessert, i packed the Food torte in every available remaining cranny
painfully stuffed, but unbelievably P_O_Experience/satisfied, i almost forgot that i had work to do the next day
next time i'm in town, this place will definitely be on my short list
i really did like this place and would P_O_Experience/go_back Restaurant if in the A_Environment
they do have some growing pains to work out
they do need to remodel
i believe from what i saw they are working on that
i don't go to a Food for Ambience anyways so i didn't have any major issue with this
if you like a Food with Ambience las vegas is about 5 hours away
their Food is good, i liked the grape leaves, F_FoodItem schwarma, and i P_O_Experience/enjoyed the hummus and fresh made F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
thoughts, have a F_FoodItem F_FoodItem station that someone can work, instead of the S_Staff running around trying to do everything (to the S_Staff, you were fantastic, i wanted to give you a hug when i left!)
Restaurant are some tweaks that need to happen to some of the Food, mostly the american like the F_FoodItem alfredo, F_FoodItem nuggets etc
i would love it if they would give my S_Staff friend a job he could turn the ok to fabulous as he is amazing with eastern Food, and american at that
it appears to be a family run place, husband, wife and two daughters
i will tell you this, their two girls are some of the most respectful well mannered girls i have ever met
they were amazingly attentive
if the S_Staff read your reviews, and from the Service i am pretty sure you do, because i saw major changes from some of the reviews, you have a great thing going for you
focus on the american Food making it better, or even better then that taking that out and adding more mediterranean Food (or thai even
curries are awesome and relatively easy to make and unlike some people i am ok with that kind of Food Restaurant
)i will P_O_Experience/be_back, and look forward to watching you blossom in the valley!
man, i love a F_FoodItem
nothing makes me as happy as a P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, cheesy F_FoodItem, perfect fries, and an F_Ingredients cold F_Drinks
it's seriously the best way to raise my spirits
the F_FoodItem Restaurant are pretty good
they're F_FI_CookingLevel well, the F_Ingredients are good, and they're pretty big
the regular S_Delivery of fries is way too big for me, so i try to stay away from it
the cool F_Drinks machine that allows for a million F_Drinks combinations is pretty cool, though i always end up with sprite and peach flavor
idk
in short, i like the Food Restaurant
so why three O_Exp_StarsByCus? this place is expensive for what it is
it's a little F_FoodItem joint, nbd, A_LocatedArea close to an in n out and smashburger
both places serve amazing F_FoodItem for better prices
i went to five S_Staff a few days ago and spent $24 on two F_FoodItem and two fries
seriously
i coulda gone to applebee's and done their 2-for-$20 deal i love so much
the O_Pay_Price Restaurant are too expensive for what it is
we were Restaurant last night
very A_Env_Type but scored a A_Fur_Table A_OutsideView
the Food was pretty good but the S_Staff we had was miserable
we asked S_Staff to not bring the Food til we had finished F_FoodItem
of course that request was ignored and the dinner A_Entertainment up shortly after F_FoodItem
S_Staff then brought the check before asking if we wanted F_Drinks or F_Dessert
i like the place but after last night we will rethink going Restaurant
went Restaurant for our wedding anniversary and loved it
at first when we pulled into the strip mall, i thought, "hm
" but it was really wonderful
the A_Decor is charming and very well thought out
the design features an open A_Plc_Kitchen, which we were A_Fur_Table near, but we never had a problem with too much noise
our S_Staff welcomed us with a "happy anniversary" and was exceptionally P_S_Stf_Availability/attentive
the S_Staff, who's from chicago, stopped by the A_Fur_Table and talked with us for several S_Del_Time
the Food (i had the scottish F_FoodItem; my husband, the F_FoodItem) was P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
they've only been open about seven months but were decently busy for a monday night
the S_Menu is not large but it is varied - everything from buffalo sirloin to rack of F_Ingredients, F_FoodItem, etc
and the F_Drinks list is similarly not broad but excellent
our S_Staff said that on friday and saturday nights it's best to make a O_Reservation; we had one for monday but probably didn't need it
highly P_O_Experience/recommend and if we lived in phoenix we'd definitely P_O_Experience/go_back often
as it is, we're in georgia and will have to rely on our az friends to help keep rusconi's open
check it out - you won't be P_O_Experience/disappointed!
swordfish F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Taste/delish! with a very cold mic ultra
this place is great
S_Delivery delivery from them and it was fast, and the F_FoodItem was still hot and gooey F_FoodItem
the delivery S_Staff, S_Staff i think, was very P_S_Stf_Appearance/professional and was a speedy S_Staff
he called when he was Restaurant, cause he S_Delivery to the ballys Restaurant
super nice S_Staff, and it shoes what kind of Ambience they have based on the people that midtown hires
5 O_Exp_StarsByCus for P_F_FI_Taste/yummy Food and great Service
i really like what the huxley have done to this A_Places, and especially on their S_Menu: both Food, and F_FoodItem
previously the rutland A_Plc_Bar, which had been around for a fair while, a makeover and change of name can do the world of good
i always liked the rutland, but it felt very much like a A_Plc_Bar to have meetings in, or a subdued F_Drinks
the huxley has a great vibe midweek
i've yet to visit at the weekend
but yknow what? as far as a A_Plc_Bar for a mid-week after-work F_Drinks and F_FoodItem goes, it's pretty good
i've heard amazing things about their F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem
i will P_O_Experience/be_back to try these (the F_FoodItem come with two patties per F_FoodItem?!)when i came, i tried a F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem was really P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and P_F_FI_Taste/delicious
when a A_Plc_Bar isn't specifically a 'F_FoodItem A_Plc_Bar' i can be very suspicious
so many times a F_FoodItem can come unmuddled, or with chunky F_Ingredients instead of crushed, and it can just F_FI_Taste like watery, F_Drinks with a sprinkling of F_FoodItem
not at the huxley
i happened to meet the mixologist at the A_Plc_Bar, who was very proud of all his creations (he has made all the recipes) and was really keen to make some F_FoodItem for me
i love this kind of energy and passion
Restaurant were some delicious looking numbers Restaurant too
the Food S_Menu is also really unusual, inspired and different
F_FoodItem are, well, so hot right now
but Restaurant were also nibbles like poached duck F_FoodItem with black F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem
or a scotch dug F_FoodItem with hp F_Ingredients
or mini chipolatas with dip, which i had
and the F_Ingredients sole, with a side of seaweed F_FoodItem
note: do not put half the seaweed F_FoodItem in your mouth at once
it F_FI_Taste like the sea
like the sea and F_FoodItem
i used to have a through-and-through phobia of F_FoodItem
it was not pleasant
i am assured, however, that a little nibble of the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem is quite pleasant
the huxley is a new A_Plc_Bar, and new A_Plc_Bar take a while to settle into themselves
i hope it goes from strength to strength, however, as you can see they've put a lot of thought into the new Food S_Menu, the F_FoodItem S_Menu, and the new A_Decor
now, when can i go back for a F_FoodItem?
bob's is a great little Food, with four A_LocatedArea in the pittsburgh area
we ate at the mckee's rocks A_LocatedArea on our last visit to pittsburgh
upon entering, we were immediately greeted by a A_OutsideView of all the Food F_Ingredients being F_FI_CookingLevel on the flat top
one thing to remember Restaurant: the Food are very P_F_FI_Size/big
my wife and i split a Food F_FoodItem made with P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem, very spicy sausage, F_FoodItem, F_FoodItem etc
my only complaint would be the F_Ingredients
they were definitely not needed
our S_Staff was dawn, who i also think was the S_Staff
S_Staff was very P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly and P_S_Stf_Behavior/attentive
Offers your money
F_FoodItem greens were F_FI_Quality with some rotten leaves
my friend got the baby caesar and it was made with iceberg F_Ingredients and tasteless dressing
the F_FoodItem was P_F_FI_Healthy/salty
F_FoodItem were P_F_FI_Size/tiny P_F_FI_Size/tiny which was fine because they were not worth the calories
the F_FoodItem was less than P_F_FI_Taste/tasty
the Service was very good
i was hoping this would be a good A_Environment restaurant to frequent but i'll have to keep looking
sorry S_Staff, you failed to S_Delivery
this Restaurant is fantastic! i've been Restaurant a few times for business Food and everyone has always been happy
the F_FoodItem are ample for one person or could be split if you also got a saled (which is huge)
F_FoodItem looks and F_FI_Taste P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and i love that you can ask to have as much as you want piled on and it's still the same F_FI_Price
although the line can back up at Food (much like a chipotle) since everything is made to S_Delivery, the F_FoodItem is done in 3 S_Del_Time after being F_FI_CookingLevel in a hig-powered 550 degree oven
i don't think i've even had a problme finding any S_Seating even when the S_Del_OrderingMethod is long
i actually think this F_FoodItem is better than 90% of F_FoodItem i've had elsewhere
to me, it's Worthiness of O_Exp_StarsByCus
i just wish they had one right where i live
i can't get enough of this japanese fushion Restaurant, soho!! :)) Food Restaurant are P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh, P_F_FI_Taste/delicious, & it all comes with a nice clean presentation
we recently tried a few new Food
if you're open-minded try the following: blue fin F_FoodItem--omg & fresh uni (eat it without dipping it Food)
in a nutshell, you must must come!! :))
just wanted to thank the wonderful S_Staff al and the very P_S_Stf_Behavior/accommodating S_Staff for a dinner to remember
i've lived Restaurant in phoenix for about six years now and love the Food at F_FoodItem
my mother passed away last year and i have two aunts that came to visit to celebrate her life on the 1 year anniversary of her passing, with my sister and i
she loved F_FoodItem and we thought we would go to someplace nice to eat with great Food
it was very busy that eve
we pre S_Delivery our deep Food F_FoodItem, we were A_Fur_Table within the S_Del_Time S_Del_Time,  and got our F_FoodItem quickly after sitting down
to my P_O_Experience/disappointment it was not the bubbly P_F_FI_CookingLevel/hot F_FoodItem i P_O_Experience/enjoyed at previous visits
it was just kind of warm
i let the S_Staff know and the S_Staff al came to our A_Fur_Table and asked if we would like a new F_FoodItem  on the house
another F_FoodItem wow! we mentioned the reason we were Restaurant that evening and i guess it touched his soul
he added a fantastic F_Dessert with ice cream  for our celebration of my mothers life  and picked up the whole tab on the house
i have never been Service so special on such a memorable day al you made this visit from family a beautiful and wonderful memory just like my beautiful and wonderful mother
thank you for your thoughtfulness and compassion on such a difficult day
wendy o
distill is exactly what summerlin has been waiting for
they area really hasn't had a local A_Plc_Bar scene (aside from those in the neighboring A_Entertainment) before and this Restaurant really adds convenience and ease when grabbing F_Drinks with friends after work
their S_Menu is pretty impressive
it is a step up from your average A_Plc_Bar Food and has a very diverse selection (plus F_FoodItem lovers rejoice, Food is available all day!)  my personal favorite Food is the avocado F_FoodItem F_FoodItem
they S_Staff is pretty P_S_Stf_Behavior/friendly
our S_Staff was relatively new so S_Staff was still getting into the swing of things, but you could tell S_Staff was trying so i won't judge too critically
the A_Decor A_Decor is warm and inviting, and the A_Plc_Patio A_Decor is kind of fun
the A_Plc_Bathroom, however, could use an update
overall, i P_O_Experience/enjoyed distill, will be returning and would P_O_Experience/recommend to others
finally a vig in my A_Environment
we have P_O_Experience/enjoyed the vig uptown for years, now their great Food is on mccormick F_Ingredients
we loved their eye for detail with the design of this new Ambience
Restaurant offer a large A_OutsideView A_Plc_Patio plus casual Ambience inside
the Food is consistently good, from well prepared F_FoodItem, to elegant entrees
the A_Plc_Bar was always busy with both the F_FoodItem A_Env_Type to Food eating at the A_Plc_Bar
the noise level in the A_Plc_Bar side can be loud!, especially with all the hard surfaces
it could use some sound deading, and, not great for intimate conversations
the Food is the O_Exp_StarsByCus
F_FoodItem prepared P_F_FI_Healthy/fresh and as S_Delivery
note to the A_Plc_Kitchen, on last visit their F_FoodItem were way too P_F_FI_Healthy/salty with their F_Ingredients blend
their F_FoodItem and F_FoodItem are excellent
Restaurant Offers a full A_Plc_Bar with a large F_Drinks selection
and, remember Offers F_Drinks on sundays
Restaurant is plenty of S_Parking
came Restaurant for Food and was P_O_Experience/unimpressed
the S_Staff brought us F_Appetizer and F_FoodItem as soon as we sat down and then was gone for like S_Del_Time
no F_Drinks
i did not try any F_FoodItem, so it could be spectacular for all i know
i had the Food portion of F_FoodItem F_FoodItem, which was a good portion, but the F_FoodItem was really P_F_FI_Quality/tough
i did like the F_Ingredients, though
we also S_Delivery F_FoodItem, which i liked, but the dipping F_Ingredients was off
my bf S_Delivery the F_FoodItem Food, which was a good portion but again, the dipping F_Ingredients was off
probably would not rush back Restaurant, but i am always willing to try something more than once, because you never know!
Food: decent, but not great
their F_FoodItem are P_F_FI_Size/huge and come in portions no human could possibly eat
the F_FoodItem and other Food Food are regularly portioned
Service: good
the S_Staff was very nice, but S_Staff efforts to sell us the most P_F_FI_Price/expensive Food on the S_Menu were not subtle at all
F_FI_Price: overpriced, but what can you expect when you come to Restaurant? F_FoodItem and waffles range from F_FI_Pricethe café is A_LocatedArea inside the sls, so make sure to S_Parking in their S_Parking structure
the F_FoodItem are pretty good, but make sure you share with them with someone, as you typically get three F_FoodItem (F_FoodItem P_F_FI_Size/larger than the S_Cutlery they're Service on)
the F_Drinks comes in a french press, which makes a very nice S_Cutlery of F_Drinks
however, be aware that they charge per physical S_Cutlery that you S_Delivery, even if you only have one french press
they didn't disclose this at any point until we got the O_Payment, which was kind of shady
this Restaurant was good, but definitely nothing to rave about
surely Restaurant are other, better Restaurant to eat in A_LocatedArea
stopped in Restaurant for Food bc it's right around the corner from my work and i was really looking forward to it
the S_Staff was very nice
i asked what the F_FoodItem F_FoodItem consisted of bc i don't like deep P_F_FI_CookingLevel/fried/heavy Food for Food
turns out it's just seasoned F_FoodItem so that's what i S_Delivery
the F_FoodItem itself was good, the F_FoodItem wasn't seasoned evenly
the first couple F_Appetizer i could F_FI_Taste some of the seasoning and after that it was really bland same thing with the tzatziki F_Ingredients
i was very P_Restaurant/disappointed
i could have O_Payment the same O_Pay_Price, been even closer to work and had an amazing Food if i had just went to Restaurant mix
