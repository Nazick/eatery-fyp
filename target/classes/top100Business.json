Not sure why it took me so long to write my own review, maybe because the 67 that came before mine do a pretty good job of describing it.  However, I woke up today and felt like giving my two cents - so here goes:\n\nWhether you go to Postino for a business lunch, an afternoon glass of wine, a happy hour, dinner, or even after dinner drink - you can't go wrong!  Postino is great for any occasion!  (Although maybe not a big group based on what I read in previous reviews).  \n\nI've been for pretty much all of the occasions listed above, and every visit to Postino, I leave a satisfied customer.  My favorite lunchtime menu items are the brushcetta (perfect for sharing as an appetizer and fun to choose from the variety of delicious selections), the Mixed Greens Salad (which comes with shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, gorgonzola, and crispy leeks served with poppyseed vinaigrette - and I usually add turkey to it too), and the Raspberry Chicken Salad.  LOL at my long description, but had to include it all!\n\nI'm not usually a daytime drinker but I'm all for starting happy hour early and taking advantage of 'wine by the glass' $4 special - great wine list! The ambiance and service is fantastic and it's fun to people watch at Postino as well.  It's a fantastic little neighborhood place, and there are several little details that make Postino stand out in my eyes... next time you're there, check out the sugar / sweet'n low dish thing on the table - there's a little something special there if you need to spit out your gum before digging into your meal :)  Also check out the branded rolls of TP in the bathroom - so cute!\n\nCan't wait to go on a Monday night sometime soon to take advantage of their special: $9 off a bottle of wine and pizza from LGO!

Having lived in NYC for a while, I became a bit spoiled and was pleasantly surprised to find Postino comparable to places I loved out there! \n\nNighttime is the best time to go as it's dim, loud and full of energy. Postino is one of my favorite places to go for a light dinner and drinks with good friends year-round; however, on a fall or spring night, when they have all the doors and windows open onto the patio, it's perfection.\n\nAs many have mentioned, the bruschetta is great. It's a good option for an appetizer or sharing for a main dish, especially if you'd rather focus on filling up with wine than food. ;) The grilled cheese appetizer is tasty, but a pretty small portion. If you're looking for a small compliment to wine, they've got a \"cheese course\" and a meat and cheese \"plate\". The cheese course comes with 3 different cheeses that they switch up frequently. It's a pretty decently sized dish, but the last time I ordered it, the \"fruit\" they mentioned on the menu was basically just dried apricots, cranberries and nuts. It wasn't bad, but with the crunchy bread it came with, there were too many dry things on one plate for my liking! If you like olives, I'd recommend splurging on the $5 olive bowl. It's a generous portion of mixed olives that will not disappoint. \n\nMy all-time favorite item at Postino is the \"Prosciutto with Brie\" Panini, on Ciabatta bread, with salad. The sandwich is soft prosciutto layered with brie, arugula and figs, drizzled with a little balsamic and olive oil and served on a super crunchy ciabatta roll. If this was the only item on the menu, I'd still make the 15 mile drive to order it. The sandwich is big enough to share, but I love it enough to eat the whole thing and suffer the consequences later. :) All of the paninis come with potato chips or salad. Rarely would I choose salad as a side, but I actually look forward to this salad almost as much as the sandwich. It's romaine lettuce, pine nuts, crumbled feta and a very light oil dressing (from what I can gather). \n\nThe two negatives, which is what drops it from 5 stars to 4 are the following: The service is often lacking. There are some really nice, attentive servers and there are some rather pretentious servers (which isn't unheard of at a wine-bar). It's really hit or miss, but I take it with a grain of salt and don't let it deter me from going. After all, a pretentious server can become great material for dinner-time laughs. \n\nThe second negative is the parking situation. This is an issue with any of the many LA Grande Orange establishments located on that corner. Pretty much any time you go there, you will have trouble finding parking. They do offer valet, but call me cheap, I'd rather not HAVE to pay for valet. \n\nTo make a long story short (I know, too late), go to Postino if you're looking for an experience you're unlikely to find anywhere else in Phoenix.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

I'm not into big chains, but maybe they'd consider a satellite location?\n\nThe bruschetta is a dream -- perfect to share with a group. I especially enjoyed the roasted pepper with goat cheese; brie, apple and fig spread; and the wonderfully salty roasted artichoke heart versions.\n\nAnd of course, I enjoyed the wine.

The waitstaff was not rude but they were not helpful either as we had to constantly remind them to bring items; they took nearly 20 minutes to take our order and you had to ask them for anything extra like water or silverware.

I had the mozzarella and chicken sandwich with pesto, sun dried tomatoes and arugula! my girl had the autostrado it had a couple different kinds of Italian meats and provolone cheese, BOMB! it was good stuff. it came with chips or a salad,we got the salad and it was a prefect match for the sandwiches *it had pine nuts.*\ni had gone to the original Postinos a couple times and of coarse it was always good, but the new one is close to my spot and now close to my heart. Steve, i will see you soon!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Definitely try the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone!  The service here is very good as well, and their hours are fairly accommodating for late evening diners.  On Monday nights there is also the added bonus of being able to order pizza from the pizzeria across the parking lot, and there are a few nights you can find a DJ there mixing it up if that's your thing.

It was only a matter of time. \n\nIt wasn't very busy for a Friday night, but I've tried to go here during the day a few times and gave up out of frustration due to the parking situation. It wasn't a problem last night. \n\nThe place is beautiful. I really like the decor and the layout. It's comfy and fancy without being too pretentious. It helped that it wasn't at all crowded and that the weather was perfect. \n\nThe service was friendly and VERY accomidating for both of our special needs ordering. I was impressed. \n\nI went into this without reading any reviews or knowing much about the place other than that it exists and people like it. I have to be honest here - I wasn't that impressed with the food. It's a simple cafe menu, so perhaps I'm being too critical, but I just didn't love it. It was decent, but not my taste. \n\nThe food is good... I'm just not going to go out of my way to eat here. The wine was good though. Maybe they have a larger list somewhere, but the wine list I saw was pretty short - particularly for a wine cafe. Still... what we had was delicious. \n\nMy only other gripe was that it was a pretty spendy experience - even with a discount. I much prefer Kasimierz - which is probably an unfair thing to compare it to - but I do. Maybe My Florist would be more appropriate of a comparison, but I haven't been there in years. I think this place is great and has mass appeal... My not being totally on board with it probably says more about my taste than this place.\n\nI would definitely eat and drink here again, and I would recommend it to friends and strangers.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

I finally got a chance to go check it out. I'm not too much of a drinker, but the $5 Wines By The Glass Happy Hour is great, especially since they've extended it to 5 PM! \n\nIt was a leisurely early dinner, getting to Postino about 4:15, and the place was already starting to fill up! (By the time we got our food, around 4:45, it was completely packed!!!) I wanted to try the bruschetta, but my dining companion (my lovely sister) didn't want to split it (due to allergies, more on that later), and I couldn't take home leftovers, so I decided on the Select Two, going with the Autostrada Panini and Italian Picnic Salad without walnuts. I also got a glass of the Ca Del Sarto Pinot Grigio (I only drink whites). My sister had been to Postino multiple times and knew what she wanted to order, knowing it should be allergen (aka nut) free (also the Select Two, the Prosciutto with Brie Panini and Mediterranean Salad). She informed our waitress though of her condition and thankfully our waitress was very responsive. We sat and talked for about a half hour before our food came (watching the mimosas float by our table sped up the time), and I dug right in. However I was alerted to the shaky voice of my sister that she had found a nut in her salad. We called over our waitress and she was super apologetic about it, and quickly set out to resolve the issue. My sister thankfully didn't eat the nut (which turned out to be a walnut)!!! She got a new salad and sandwich and checked everything over, and everything came out a-ok. Our waitress was really great about the whole thing! My food was quite yummy! The sandwich was full of delectable salty meats, but I wished it was a tid bit warmer. The salad was top notch though! I've always avoided beets in my food endeavors, I don't know why, even though I had never tried them, but the Italian Picnic salad has opened my eyes to the glory that is the roasted beet! The different flavors and textures all blended together so nicely, especially with the crispy bacon! I wish I could have pinpointed what was in the dressing so I could recreate it at home!

Their wine selection is pretty good too, I've fallen in love with the Acadia white that I cant seem to find anywhere else.  \n\nThough well priced for the most part, you do have to watch your tab - you can leave with a 30 buck tab up to a 150 tab for two people. \n\nOnly negitives I'd say would be the seating, particularly the outside, where they absolutely CRAM you in to the point you might be uncomfortable if you dont like snuggling with your neighbor.

It was on a Tuesday, and I was fortunate enough to stumble onto the online menu beforehand and find that Postino offers $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta on Tuesdays after 8pm.  I was a little wary that it seemed very noisy inside, but there was no way I'd have my cousin steam outside in the patio after she had just recounted how perfect the weather was in San Francisco, a stop she'd made before arriving in PHX.  \n\nWe had a blast!  For $20, the two of us enjoyed a nice bottle of Heron chardonnay and a platter of six HUGE bruschetta halves (ricotta with dates and pistachios; smoked salmon with capers and herbs; roasted red peppers and goat cheese; and prosciutto with figs and mascarpone). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#oGjoq-y0BpTf_Ug6K6vmgQ  My non-sweet-toothed cousin's fave was the peppers and goat cheese.  It was good, but I always have red peppers and goat cheese, and since I have a ROARING sweet-tooth, my #1 fave was the ricotta, dates, and pistachios.  Tied for 2nd place were the mascarpone and salmon.  I'm not much of a prosciutto fan, as I find it a tad too salty, but the sweet mascarpone cut through some of the saltiness.  The salmon and capers were so tasty!  \n\nNice atmosphere- lots of positive energy.  Our server was efficient, friendly, and never overbearing.  Cute restroom.  My only complaint is that it is so dark indoors!  I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again- I like to feast my eyes on the food's presentation!

But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating. \n\nWe went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a \"valet\" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK. \n\nSadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent. \n\nWe ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about). \n\nFor dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto. \n\nAnd honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini). \n\nAnd hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

What? It's not? Well, I would consider it in poor taste.\n\nI got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know. \n\nAll of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as \"Cinnamon Toast Crunch\", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them. \n\nTo top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service.

The retail wine area at the entrance is awkward to me, because it's cramped and I frankly think you should all be buying wine at my shop so perhaps I'm a touch biased. Anyway, it is a great way for you to take home whatever you enjoyed with your dinner. Damn magnanimity. \n\nI wasn't in the mood for drunk biking that night so I skipped the adult beverages for a pot of tea. I get that this is a wine cafe so really no one going here is going to review a cup of tea, except for me. Tea selection was sad. Tea has the same cult following that wine does, so three options seemed half-hearted. And my pot of hot water was only half filled, which, for $2.50 is lame.  Okay I'm done bashing PW. \n\nThe second time I drove in for a take out order of the bruschetta board. My order was ready, the place was packed and I was able to get in and out in less than 3 mins! We ordered the date and pistachio on ricotta, the fig and prosciutto, the mozz/tomato/basil and the smoked salmon pesto. Great value to order ratio, each slice was huge and pre-chopped into littler bites. The smoked salmon was definitely my favorite, with the runner up being the pistachio/date combo.

I mean all of them were decent nothing was amazing.  In fact, i think I could easily put together a couple of them myself and have them taste just as good if not better.\n\nNine Iron-  Once again, it was OK.  Nothing special at all.

This was our 4th dinner out in a row and the first 3 had impeccable service.  This place did not.  I felt like it was a lot of waiting and waiting more.   We ordered something they did not bring and when we asked for that something we waited and waited....  Servers were nice enough though but they didn't seem that busy on a Sunday night so I would have expected service to be better.\n\nAmbiance:\nServers-Well, the servers I would classify as Arizona hipsterish.  Like not real hipsters.  They should go to SF to see those.  But definitely trying to be hipsters\n\nPeople there- 30- somethings at birthday dinners mixed with 20-somethings on date.  And yes, we did witness a couple making out.  Once again this was 7pm on a Sunday. Spare me please.\n\nThe Place- First, we asked to sit inside because it was slightly cold.  Well they sit us inside but right next to the open half of the restaurant so it basically was sitting outside but without the heater.  Other than that it was cute inside.\n\nMaybe this place was more like 2 1/2 -3 but I was so disappointed with the food and ambiance that I have to round down to 2.  This place is probably great during happy hour but when you're paying full price, it's just so not worth it.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

The interior is decorated very tastefully and the selection of wine is proudly displayed. The patio is wonderful and relaxing. \n\nI was there for lunch and ordered the half panini (prosciutto and brie) with a salad (raspberry chicken).

It's about $13 for four pieces, and I thought that it would be four small toast rounds.  Boy was I wrong - it's a meal in itself.  Each bruschetta is about the size of a hand and cut into four manageable strips.  I tried the tomato/mozzarella/basil (my usual standby), brie/apple/fig and ricotta/dates/pistachio.  Although I was afraid of the more \"adventurous\" ones, I wound up liking the ricotta and brie bruschetta even more than the tomato/mozzarella one, which totally held its own.

I came on a double date, each couple ordering a bottle of wine and bruschetta (arguably pronounced brush-ket-ah) totaling a mere $20 a pair!\n\nThe wine selection is fairly eclectic. The BF and I rather arbitrarily picked the Carro Red Blend from Spain, a \"Postino Exclusive\". When it came to the taste test the waitress did not assume the man would decide and let me taste for satisfaction (yes- I felt empowered). Fantastico! Perfect mix of smooth with a kick that's not too bitey or intense. \n\nThe bruschetta came in generous portions of 4x4, 4 slices of 4 different selections, the perfect amount of food to complement half a bottle of wine.

Lucky me :) I had been to this location one other time, but I wasn't there very long and I forgot what I ate. SO, i was really looking forward to this trip. Plus, Amber W was kind enough to give me a gift card for Christmas. Thanks Amber! \n\nThe parking here is sort of on the ridiculous side because the lot is so small. You have to valet your vehicle. I think it was $3. It was busy when we arrived and were quoted about 25 minutes. So we went over to the waiting area to start with some wine. We didn't even have a chance to order because our table was ready already. We were seated outside and I feared for my date's life because it was a little chilly and I don't think the dress she was wearing was really made for winter nights. Thankfully there was a heater planted right behind her. \n\nOur server took our drink orders promptly. I had the Tierra de Luna Malbec. Very good. She had a Reisling, which was very sweet and fruity. Started with the bruschetta and holy schnikes! I could have eaten this all night. We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good. \n\nFor the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it. \n\nUnfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect. \n\nAgain, thanks Amber W for the gift!!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

What's that? I can start my bottle now and easily move with my meal and my server once my table is ready? And you say that I can do this on Monday and AGAIN on Tuesday, starting at 8pm? Every week? Can this be true?  Thank you, Postino, for having the best wine and food deal in the valley, and creating a great atmosphere in which to enjoy wine with friends. \n\nI love wine. So do lots of other people that show up at 8pm sharp, rain or shine, to take advantage of the awesome Monday/Tuesday special. So be prepared to wait for a seat. If you are sharp like a hawk or stealthy like a fox, you might catch one of those coveted bar seats, but otherwise you'll stand at small tables, casually drinking your wine and doing some people watching until the host finds you and guides you to your table. You will love your wine selection. Your bruschetta will be made with the the freshest ingredients on crusty MJ bread, in the perfect proportions. Do try my favorites: Prosciutto, mascarpone, & fig; Red peppers & goat cheese; Ricotta with pistachio & dates; and Pesto with smoked salmon. Happiness served on a wood-cutting board. I paired my bruschetta with a spicy corn chowder, and it was just the best meal for a rainy night. \n\nThe servers are very cool and know what they are talking about. They will not steer you wrong with a wine selection. If you order a bottle that is not to your liking, no problem! They serve all wine by the glass, so you can easily send it back and try another! They want you to enjoy your experience and selection, and thus have built in the flexibility for people to take risks and try new wines. Have fun with it! \n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend or two, valet the car, put your name in for a table, get started on a bottle, make laughter and conversation, and finally take your seats, enjoy your food, and order more wine. You will be fully satisfied and will have had a great night.

Everything was very fresh and the dressing was flavorful.\n\nThey also offer a good variety of bruschetta so it would make a great place for happy hour if you just wanted a drink and a little bite to snack on.\n\nOne minus - parking sucks. We did the valet, which is free but you know you gotta tip so it's not really free.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Only a minute walk from home (had to through that in!) and never a need to find parking!\n\nWaited only 5-10 minutes for a table.  Miles is always quick with water and olives for starting off.  We ordered the bruschetta, of course (Brie & Apples 2x, Prosciutto/Fig, Salmon.)  She was craving a spanish tempranillo and I settled on a zinfandel.  Talking, eating, drinking, lounging ensued...  Then, the phone starts ringing, a few different calls lining up the weekend, climbing etc.  Dhargya called and he mentioned that he and friend were heading to Postino Central, a quick re-direct and they were on the way here.  Wouldn't you rather join good friends?\n\nThey arrived and of course Postino staff is very accommodating.  Chairs were brought over immediately, wine and champagne ordered quickly.  Another great evening with great friends at the best Wine Bar in Phoenix! \n\nTry the happy hour special one day soon and avoid waiting for a table or attempting to find parking, 11am-5pm $5 wine glasses.

We went with a bottle of a California Cab (delicious, I almost drank the whole bottle myself), a board of bruschetta, and the nine iron panini. Mike is a pretty picky eater, but I thought I was going to have to fight him for one of the pieces of prosciutto with figs & mascarpone he liked it so much. I love getting him to try new things and even more so when he actually likes them. The smoked salmon with pesto and warm artichoke pieces were also delish. The nine iron was also very tasty. The bacon and mozzarella were definitely the stars of this dish. The mozzarella just melted in your mouth. \n\nThe staff here was so friendly. Our water glasses were never empty and someone was always checking in on us. I was also walked to the bathroom when I asked where it was.\n\nThanks for making our first visit so great!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Music.\n\nWhat a mission statement!  And how wildly Postino succeeds!  I LOVE this place. lovelovelove.\n\nArrived in the afternoon prior to flying home to take advantage of the generous 11-7 happy hour with 5 dollar glasses of wine and pitchers of beer.  Was greeted by a lovely gentleman who asked if we wanted a \"proper table,\" but since we did not, he escorted us to a loungey area and seated us at two super comfy chairs with a nice table in between.\n\nThe place itself is a former historic post office; the space itself is funky and fun, with lots of natural light coming in and wonderful music!  We jammed to Bloc Party, Passion Pit, and so many other great songs.  As we sampled their libations, here were some highlights:\n-Bellini: so fresh and tasty and only 5 bucks!\n-Pinot Noir: can go so wrong, but was so right, especially for 5 bucks!\n-Pitcher of beer: a yummy, citrusy wheat beer; about 2 and a half glasses to these pitchers, but again, only 5 bucks!\n-Pub Board: yummy, warm, salted pretzel bites, excellent cheese, chorizo, and corn nuts. Great with beer.\n-Bruschetta: OMG so good!  One order gets you four large bruschettas (cut in half for sharing). We loved the goat cheese with roasted red peppers, brie and apple with fig spread (swoon!), white bean with tomatoes, and salami with pesto. Oh so yummy.\n\nThe service was amazing, the vibe was oh so cool, and the food and drinks were priced well and yummy.  To me, this place is like what many LA places try to be, but they actually succeed without being pretentious or overpriced.

If for some cosmic reason you haven't made it, you really should.\n\nSometimes you just aren't ready to go straight home from work. That's when it's time to tap your local neighborhood eatery, pull up a chair and unwind.\n\nPostino Winecaf\u00e9 is one of those hangouts. Its first location opened in 2001 by the same folks subsequently responsible for La Grande Orange and LGO Pizzeria. Even if either location isn't in your 'hood, you'll quickly feel welcomed by an attractive and friendly staff.\n\nAt the Arcadia location I visited, parking is at a premium, so it's a good idea to come early or late. Checking the car into the valet (only $3) will save potential aggravation. Parking is complimentary at the Central location.\n\nAs I sat taking in the crowd and the space, I couldn't help but ponder: Should I order beer or wine? With a worldwide and world class selection, there is plenty to choose from.\n\nI was feeling like a Belgium beer, so I went for the Chimay Grand Reserve ($8). At quadruple the flavor and double the alcohol content compared to domestics, this beer has a certain yeasty earthiness that's surprisingly not heavy or thick.\n\nA small bowl of olives came to the table so I could start chowing down with my drink selection. They're smart by teasing with a small bowl because after one olive you'll want to order a full bowl ($5) with a blend of Luques, Picholines, Gaetas, Red Cerignolas, Arbequinas and Castelvetranos.\n\nSnacking and sharing is key to the menu, but if you want to compose dinner out of salads and sandwiches, that's just as easy.\n\nThe Pub Board ($10) severs up a soft, hot and steamy pretzels made from local bakery MJ Bread. Alongside are a selection of Schreiner's chorizo, cornichon pickles, aged cheddar and giant Spanish corn nuts for a major snack attack.\n\nPanini, a grilled Italian sandwich, has many varieties. On this visit the Nine Iron ($9.50) was just all right. Filled with hickory-smoked bacon and layered with grilled chicken and fresh burrata mozzarella, it sounds like a hole-in-one, but the soggy lettuce left me in the sand trap.\n\nThe salad that came along was dressed well but it was composed of too many pieces of white and bitter romain cores. After mentioning this to the server it this was quickly addressed with apologies. It's OK to share your expectations with any establishment, whether good or bad.\n\nBruschetta ($12.75), four to an order grilled bread covered with a choice of preparations, scored major kudos. It was love at first bite! My choices were Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives and Salami with Pesto. Salty, creamy, sweet and chewy -- this was a full-on taste party!\n\nThe Salted Caramel Sundae ($5) was the grand finale. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered corn nuts and a pretzel stick with a salted caramel shot was all I ever wanted.\n\nThis is food that I love to eat -- clean, simple and fresh. When paired with my favorite beer or wine, I could easily stop by on my way home from work every night.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

I wound up feeling like an idiot for talking it up so much.\n\nWe got seated quickly, and were given water.  The waiter asked us if we'd like drinks while waiting for my partner, and I ordered an iced tea. That was the second to last time we saw him.  \n\n10 minutes later, still waiting for my partner, and for my iced tea.\n\nFinally, she showed up, and he came back to take our order. Still no iced tea -- he told me it was on the way.  We ordered.\n\nMy soup came out first (I had wanted it WITH my grilled cheese), and finally, 30 minutes after having sat down, I got my iced tea.\n\nThe food, as always, was amazing. The veg friendly broccoli cheddar soup was soup-er tasty (haha...sorry, it's early), and as usual, the bruschetta and paninis were good too.\n\nThe problem arouse when we wanted to leave. My bestie wanted a box for her other half of her sandwich, and our server was no where to be found. Upon further look, he was seated at a table at the back of the restaurant. Now, when I used to work in the service industry, even if you were going on break, you'd either finish your tables first, or hand them to another server and let your tables know. He did neither.\n\nWe flagged down not one, not two, but THREE different people trying to get a box and our bill.  The table next to us, who sat after us, got both their dessert AND their bill before we could even get ours. All three people we asked said they'd bring box and bill right out; no dice.  FINALLY, we got the bill. It took another 5 or 6 minutes to get the cards back to sign.\n\nMy friend, while she loved the food, was surprised I'd recommended a place with such poor service.  I explained it had never been that way before.  Regardless, it's going to be a little while before I go back; I don't usually have 90+ minutes to waste.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Love, luv, luhv the brushetta with my favs right now being fig and prosciutto, brie with apples, the white bean and pesto and salami! You also can't go wrong with their salads and sandwiches! Plus, I heart that the GF BF can make his own brushetta experience by ordering the platter off the appetizers list! It's basically a deconstructed brushetta platter with all the fixins!! \n\nThe by the glass wines are usually very good, although they mostly will be ones you have never heard of! Never a bad thing to try something new! Their by the bottle selection rocks and I so appreciate their few nods to Washington wines like DeLille etc! \n\nFinally, what makes me love Postino's aside from my wonderful company, are the servers! I have to show some love for Dominic, who is simply wonderful and always takes such good care of us (thanks for picking out all the bright green olives for us yesterday!) He is GF too so he feels the plight of all of you trying to avoid that evil flour! Also a treat to see Troy as well! \n\nFinally, don't miss the $5 glasses before 5 pm on all days, including Sat and Sunday! It may make me slow on Monday morning, but at least I'm still smiling from the memories!! Thanks Posties!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Their sandwiches are amazing (although I don't actually like their focaccia bread, I always went with the cibata). The waiters generally remember who you are, and some of them even remembered the wine I get so much so that when they rotated it out of the menu they were genuinely concerned and addressed it as soon as I arrived! \n\nOn Sundays and (I think) a weekday night, they have live music. SUCH a great ambiance! If you love olives as much as I do, you have to try the olive sampler platter. It's brilliant. Even their soups are delicious. If I ever move, I will miss this place for sure.

It is an awesome little hangout spot with a great selection of wine and beer and you can't go wrong with any food consisting of bread, brie, prosciutto, figs and the like.  The valet parking and the Range Rovers out front made me nervous for the clientele that comes here (as my boyfriend and I pull up in my Kia) but I have never had such excellent service.  In fact when we walked in we were slightly overwhelmed and didn't quite know who to talk to about a table when the hostess walks up to us and asks if we needed help and my boyfriend blurted out \"we don't know what we're doing!\" and without even smirking she said she'd take our name for our table of 4 and then come find us when one was available, in the mean time we could get a drink and wait at the cocktail tables. Not 30 seconds from when we walked over to the table another waiter walked up to us and asked if we needed a drink and showed us the drink menu. All this at 6:30pm on an already busy Friday night! About 15 minutes pass, our friends show up, we have our drinks and then a section of the bar opens up at the end that nobody else has taken so another waitress/hostess/whatever asks us \"are you a table of 4? would you like to sit here?\" We aren't fussy so we just sit and here we are the rest of the night. My friend even got a free Fish Head (Dogfish?) beer for just being right there when they accidentally poured the wrong one for another patron. I'll definitely have to check this out again on one of the happy hour nights, our waiter got me with the \"Bruschetta Board and bottle of wine for $20 on Tuesday nights\"!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

I also ordered, against my will, instead of wine the Cucumber Honey Lemonade. It really sounded disgusting and ended up to be amazing. For desert we ordered the Vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate covered corn nuts, a pretzel stick and salted caramel.

So, when I set out for Phoenix to spend some quality time with family, my one goal for the low-key weekend was to hit up a local happy hour.\n\nMy great-aunt had heard good things about Postino's and Yelp confirmed it was a solid happy hour bet - coming up 2nd in the search queue. So great-aunt & grandmother in tow, I headed for Postino (quaintly named as the location formerly housed a post office!) for their Sunday afternoon reggae and white sangria. I first noted the full parking lot, which I came to find out later - has discouraged some other relatives from visiting Postino. But for an LA-kid, the fact that free nearby lots and street parking was available - well, ain't that a novel concept?\n\nI also noted was that we did have to add our names to a waiting list; happy hour is not at the bar, per se, it's to be ordered from your seats. So we bopped around the adjacent La Grande Orange shop to bide our time - it also seemed like a good time with good food (albeit loud & busy). Thankfully, our wait was short and we were sat outside, which was fine in the 95 degree temperature - almost everywhere seems to have nice shading and misters.\n\nMy gang of three forwent the $5 wine and beer deals and instead opted for the Sunday special - $5 white wine sangria. I quite enjoyed mine, but my HH partners thought it a bit sour and added splenda. There are no food deals on the happy hour menu, but the prices are not too wallet-depleting. I got the  1/2 Italian Market Salad (greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon (no bacon for me!) and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette) and  1/2 vegetarian sandwich (grilled Asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe tomatoes, goat cheese, and house-made pesto) for $9.50 and a cup of the Brocolli-cheddar soup for $2.50. \n\nI didn't leave any room for the bruschetta, but it sounded great - you pick four options of toppings (including brie & apples with fig spread; smoked salmon or salami with pesto; white bean with chopped tomato; ricotta with dates & pistachios, and more) for $12.75.\n\nThe crowd was pretty homogenous - youngish professionals on family time listening to the one-man reggae band. I think it'd be a great spot to catch up with a girlfriend over the weekend. And I'd love to see what kind of crowd the early evening/evening brings. To me, it seems weeknights would be optimal for a date night.\n\nI also wonder about the 11-5 happy hour, which is great for the weekend, but I wonder who can partake on weekdays...", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

In a foodie way, too.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a hot humid Thursday night. The lightings were great to bring a date or to catch up with a friend and there were fairly good amount of room noise to keep your conversation on the privacy level. The service was just lovely. Oh, the little \"Gum\" note-card was utterly cute. You can either spit your gum on the note-card or exchange phone numbers. :)\n\nThe first time I visited Postino, I wanted to come back for more of their bruschettas. My boyfriend and I shared the various bruschetta platter: \n1. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - He quickly picked this because the first time he had it became his favorite and was confident that I would absolutely love it, and I did -- I loved the sweet taste of the fig with the crunchiness of the apples. yummm! The composition of the brie, apples and fig gives this bruschetta a sweet taste.\n2. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - Since we had 3 more bruschetta options to pick, we went for something light and simple. Everything was fresh! The combination of the mozzarella, tomato and basil was simple yet blended wonderfully together. \n3. Smoked Salmon with Pesto - This was probably my least favorite out of the four, but it was okay. Although the capers were mouth bursting with favors -- which was delish, but it didn't do much justice for the slight fishy taste of the smoked salmon.\n4. Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios - By the end of the night, he declared that this became our favorite bruschetta, evar! I think they toasted the dates a bit or something of that sort, but it was perfect. The pistachios weren't dry and the ricotta wasn't an overload. All three components made it tasted like sweet heaven in your mouth. When I think of bruschetta, I immediately think savory, but there's nothing wrong with a dessert bruschetta, right? I think not. The texture of this was just perfect. No complaints here!\n\nHe and I tend to order enough to feed 4 hungry men when we dine out. So we also called for the Panini -- the Vegetarian Panini on ciabatta to be exact. We had the side salad with crumb goat cheese. Meh, I didn't care much for this panini, maybe because I was already full off of the tasty bruschettas!\n\n\nThere's a $3 charge for Valet. But it's all worth it!\nI am definitely coming back for their bruschettas once I fly out there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Walking in, there's absolutely no indication that Katz was ever here, even though the shell of the building remains.  That said, mad props to Postino for preserving this landmark.\n\nToo be fair, I'm not a wine expert nor a frequent wine drinker.  If you are, you're more than covered at this neighborhood hangout.  The food, while a limited selection, is excellent.  I've had a couple of the paninis and the bruschetta and I've never been disappointed.  My favorites are the Turkey Panini and the Smoked Salmon and Pesto Bruschetta.  Light and flavorful and a nice complement to the Syrah I had.  \n\nThe atmosphere is very urban and industrial and is absolutely jam packed at night.  A little noisy at times for my taste as sometimes I've had to yell at my friends for them to hear me, but I pretty much expected that with the crowd this place draws.\n\nAll in all, a nice addition to the neighborhood.  Postino's reputation in the Arcadia neighborhood brought me in, and the good food and relaxed atmosphere has made me a believer.  If you're a nightlife fan then come here at dinnertime or after a movie.  If you're a foodie (like me) I recommend coming here for lunch (or Sunday Brunch) when its more relaxed and not as crowded.  If you're a wine buff, then you're good here at all hours.  RIP to Katz, but a nice new chapter for this historic location", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

I had two glasses of wine, Grayson Cabernet (which was really good) and a Reisling (I can't remember which one, but I liked it).  My friend and I also split the selection of four bruschettas.  We had the brie and apple (my favorite), the caprese, goat cheese and roasted red peppers and salami and pesto.

The service is always great, it is reasonably priced, the food and wine are delicious and the ambiance is wonderful.

This is definitely enough for two people to make a meal out of or for three to four to share as an appetizer.

(Every Monday and Tuesday night after 8pm, $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta) We missed the happy hour but now that Ive had thier homemade bruschetta...who cares! I would come back again and again even without the discounted food. \nThis restaurant is quaint and cute.

Im sure many of the other plates at this restaurant are delicious as well, but their specialty by far has to be their bruschetta! Almost any type of concoction and combo you can think of to go on flaky/crispy baquettes, this restaurant has come up with. None of the bruschetta's that I tried were dissapointing.\nLet me start by saying, this place is a \"share with everyone\" type of restaurant, which, I have no problems with because then I get to pig out and taste everyones's plates. haha!\nSo, I literally tasted almost every type of bruschetta that was on the menu.\nLet me start with the Brie and Apples with Fig spread- this almost tasted like a dessert because the tangyness of the apples. The Tomato jam with fresh sheeps milk cheese could also be had for dessert. This actually may have been my most favorite out of all the bruschettas! The cheese was sooo creamy, you could eat it with a spoon. That mixed together with the sweetness of the tomato jam------heaven.....\nProsciutto with Figs & Mascarpone\nThe Warm Artichoke Spread was mighty tasty and fresh and this coming from a girl who grew up in the \"artichoke capital of the world\" \nBurrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes- Adding burrata to anything cant be anything but delicious! And knowing that, I, a corndog/bacon LOVER think that this combo will rock anyone's world.

Will I ever steal a parking spot? Not at all, but I will look long and hard for one here. The wait is worth it yelp friends. Postino does a great job luring customers in and keeping them. With their incredible happy hour, I wish I could sneak away to dine on a glass of wine before 4:00 PM on a weekday and for those who can, I salute you. \n\nEvery time I wine and dine at Postino, I leave full, happy and satisfied. The original Postino location will also be my favorite based on it's location, ambiance, character, service and quality products. The wine is obviously top knotch here at Postino. Bottles line the walls and the staff knows their selections inside and out. They offer bottle specials all the time and you can enjoy a bottle at a reasonable price practically every day of the week. \n\nTheir food competes with the quality of their wine. I long for their bruschetta. You chose four different flavors and for a reasonable price under $15. My favorite bruschettas are the prosciutto and fig, and tomato paste with cheese. The tomato mozzarella is also a classic. But, it really just depends on your taste buds because any bruschetta you choose will be excellent. Many times, I got for the half sandwich/salad combo. I like to order the Market which isn't on the menu. It comes with pesto, tomato and mozzerela. I make sure to add chicken. The Mediterranean is my go-to salad but I vary between all of their salads. You really just can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. And it tastes even better with wine. Doesn't everything?", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

My salad was much better than it's very ordinary title. With grapes, Gorgonzola, tiny fried onion strings and a wonderful vinaigrette I left feeling satisfied but not overfilled. My husband's tuna panini was also excellent with a perfect amount of flavor.\n\nThe best part about the restaurant for me, was the ambiance.  We went late in the evening.  The soft flickering candle light and open dining room created an atmosphere that would be wonderful to dine with either friends, or a date.

You get 4 bruschetta & and a bottle of wine for only $20! The vibe of this place at night is neat. It's dark, & dimly lite with tea light candles. There are a few comfortable sofas, high top tables, regular tables, and a great patio outside. It has a very intimate feel and would be a great place for a date. It does get very busy & crowded in the evening so keep that in mind. There is usually a wait on Mondays & Tuesdays after 8pm. Service gets a little slow during their busy times. My favorite bruschetta is Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. It is very sweet! If you're desiring a salad the Raspberry Chicken salad is great. Very flavorful! I also really like the Turkey Panini, very tasty! The only bad thing I can say about this place is the parking is awful!

Hence, I tried to make reservations here, called 24 hours in advance... they told mebthey couldnt do it, but  to come in anyway and 'wait at the bar' for a table. I told them I was going to be with some older people, and asked if there was anyway we could just call in 20 minutes beforehand and put our name on the list, so my grandparents wouldnt have to stand at the bar. They said they didnt do that. Seeing as it THE EXACT SAME THING as coming in to put my name on the list and wait twenty minutes there, I dont see the problem. I asked them politely if they could make an exception considering the situation... they said absolutely not. Where I come from, restaurants will try everything they are capable of to accommodate their guests. This IS NOT what Postino's or the LGO owners do at any of their restaurants. After talking to Postino's, I tried Chelsea's and LGO and got the same answer.\n\nI also tried Chelsea's, which takes reservations for less then 10 but got the same story, they were booked and we could wait. Also asked them about calling in when we were on our way b/c I was with two older people who could not stand long... they said no way.\n\nI own two restaurants, I can tell you-- this is not appropriate customer service. Its also not very moralistic. If a frequent customer explains a situation, seeking a little help, and its not ridiculous, the restaurant shoud be happy to do it. \n\nSeems as if the LGO owners have taken a cue from Houston's... which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation.

I have also tried their Bellini which was wonderful in that the peaches in it tasted fresh and like the actual fruit instead of the canned syrupy version - a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe hummus was smooth and creamy and the artichoke dip was warm and comforting.  Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong with any of their bruschettas.  We have tasted the fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, prosciutto with figs and marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto, ricotta with dates and pisachios, roasted red peppers with goat cheese, and the warm artichoke spread - all wonderfully fresh, mouth watering, and plenty of toppings so you can experience the full flavor of the offerings.\n\nPeople watching is fun at this location if you're into a varying crowd.

I'll admit that the cheese plates also sometimes leave me wanting, but that is a rare occasion.  It has been interesting to see the wine selections evolve over the past several years.  When it first opened, Postino seemed to have nothing above $35/bottle, and that selection was good.

Simply, speechless. This place is AMAZING. I had pretty high expectations of this place and I was still blown away by the level of excellence this place carries. My amore and I decided to give this place a whirl on a Friday night, and we enjoyed every second of our experience. Upon arrival, we were told that there was an hour and a half wait, so we ventured into the bar area to have a glass of Prosecco, which was DELICIOUS by the way. About thirty minutes later, we were seated and looking over the menu. The wait was cut in half! I would have waited 6 hours for their bruschetta, though. We sampled four of their bruschetta selections, and not one piece was left behind. Their portions are large, and definately made for sharing. We topped off our scrumptious experience with an espresso and a salted caramel sundae. Im pretty sure my tastebuds are still dancing around.....As far as the service goes, it needs help. Our server was horrible. He refilled our water glasses ONCE and relied on other staff members to bring us our check. At the beginning of our visit, we were greeted by the owner, and he personally brought us a wine list, took our drink order, AND opened our vino, table side. That is so refreshing to see when the owner of a place puts his own elbow grease into maintaining his business. This place has an amazing, simple menu.

He wanted the \"Nine Iron\" which has chicken, bacon, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, and dijionnaise on ciabatta.  It was rather tasty, however, the ratio of fillings felt a little off.  I love tomato, so it wasn't a big deal to me, but the sandwich was full of it with one thin little leaf of lettuce and clumps of chicken that weren't evenly distributed between the ciabatta.  I ended up opening the sandwich and rearranging the ingredients myself in order to help it along.  Fresh produce, good flavors and amazing bruschetta!  Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong ordering it.\n\nThe service we received this time around wasn't up to par, but decent enough.  We didn't get our water refilled and the waiter never came back again so that we could order more drinks.  It was a shame.  The food still salvaged the visit though.  I just hope it doesn't happen too frequently since I plan to come here more often with some more friends.\n\nThis time we sat on the patio since it was a little quieter in order to chat and despite the chillier weather (I say that loosely, since I'm from Chicago and shouldn't really complain...) I found the outdoor torch like heaters (no, I don't know the technical term for them and apologize for that) to be perfect along with my jacket.

We enjoy Central's patio more, so we head there.  With either location, we've always asked ourselves, \"why didn't we think about opening a restaurant that just puts tasty things on bread and charge well for it?\"\n\nlet's face it...what Postino does is not rocket science.  Great composed salads, wonderful panini and bruschetta. but, there's no hard cooking.  What there is though is creativity, style and great service. \n\non our last visit, we headed to Postino Central on a Wednesday night, thinking that since it was the day before St. Patrick's, no one would be out.  well, we were wrong. first, we were turned away by the valet -- \"sorry, we're full.\"  The parking lot?  the restaurant?  Where should we go?  any tips?  so, i got on the phone and called the restaurant -- \"Your valet just turned us away, are you looking for customers tonight?\"  He was cordial and stated he would go chat with the valet about finding a better way to turn down folks who needed to park their cars.  \n\nhostess was very friendly and accommodating...giving us every option for seating.  but, given the spectacular night that it was, we wanted to wait for an outdoor table.  so, we ordered some beers with the very friendly waitress that happened by, and sat in the outdoor \"waiting area\" watching the sunset.  about 1/2 hour later, we got a prime table -- in fact the same table we eat at each time we are there. \n\nsame waitress came by.  hubby ordered a second beer (i was still nursing the \"shorty\" (only $2.50!) I'd ordered before.  We selected the bella postino platter with white bean hummus and warm artichoke dip, as well as a bruschetta board of four luscious creations.\n\n\"bus boy\" brought water and small dish of olives (okay, really small -- there were two of us and he brought 3 olives -- not 2, not 4, but 3 --yes, we arm-wrestled for the last one.)\n\nwaitress was friendly, thorough, spunky and a perfect addition to this hip, vibrant, happening place.  admittedly, we in our 40s were either parental age of the young 20 somethings gracing the place, or children of the 60+ \"second go round\" set.\n\nbruschetta -- golly!  we had pesto with salami (great quality), burrata with arugula, bacon and tomato (there was no bacon and PLEASE do not refrigerate your tomatoes), prosciutto with fig and mascarpone (oh so incredibly good) and the \"dessert\" one -- ricotta with dates and pistachios.  after polishing off the dips and the platter of breads (there are 4 pieces to each \"slice\" of bruschetta, we were stuffed.  \n\nwas intrigued by the salted caramel dessert, but there was just no room.  perhaps next time we skip the dip and save room.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.\n\nWe came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking. \n\nYou can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says \"Ok, that's $3.\" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.\n\nWhen I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said \"Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there.\" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said \"Oh\" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.\n\nAt this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely \"We don't have any more.\" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass. \n\nSeriously? Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy. \n\nAnd as for a wine bar? Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine.

So on Wednesday night I decided to take her to Postino, because I went to the one on Central and loved the food (hated the service, but the food was great). So I took her to this location. Much better! The place was way less busy (i guess that's because it wasn't one of their special nights) and we were seated right away. We even found parking over by LGO. Whoa. So, anyway, We shared a bruschetta board with the brie and apple, the goat cheese and bell pepper, burrata and bacon, and prosciutto and mascarpone and we each got a glass of wine. (I got the Haart riesling.... *drool* that has got to be one of the best rieslings I have had). So the bruschetta was good, I thought the goat cheese one was not all I had hoped for, but the apple and brie was wonderful and so was the burrata and bacon... I think burrata is my new favorite cheese.... that stuff is good! Anyway, it  was a nice night and everything was fine. So fast forward to the next day. I went with my friend and her parents to the botanical gardens and then we were going to get lunch, so I list a bunch of places we can go and they decide they want to go to LGO (Now I've never been there but really want to try their pizza, it looks amazing). So we get there and realize A) there is no table service and B) there is no pizza. Lame. So my friend says.... we could go back to postino..... haha! So we ended up going again! two days in a row. \n\nSo the second time we all got paninis and salads (and wine.... yum and 5$). I got the half and half with the turkey panini and the italian picnic salad. The turkey sandwich was pretty good, it had tomato, greens, pesto, and provolone on it. It tasted good, but nothing too special. The italian picnic salad was also just ok. I couldn't taste the vinaigrette that's supposed to be on it at all... maybe they forgot to put it on... or maybe it is ridiculously light. The other ingredients were good, it had beets, greens, goat cheese, walnuts, and some crispy things in it. My friend got the prosciutto sandwich, which I tried and it was delicious. Her dad got the nine iron which looked really good. Anyway, this was not as good an experience as the night before, but it evens out to four stars.

People think it's a great first or second date spot. They are wrong. The one down town is significantly quieter and a way better date spot. But, there are always at least five new couples there.

I am obviously not alone in this thinking because Postino can have a hefty wait time, especially for the bruchetta and wine special on Monday nights.  Its WORTH THE WAIT though.  The goat cheese and tomato jam bruchetta is the BEST!  I always try to get a double order of that one instead of picking four different kinds.  I do believe 'sharing is caring' but I have my limits and not when it comes to Postino brushettas.  \n\nThe wine list is extensive and there are always helpful recommendations for any palatte or budget for that matter.  I have sat at the bar and sampled various wines before choosing and the bartenders have all been very knowledgeable and friendly.  \n\nPostino is a perfect place for a date, girls night out, or family dinner.  It is hard to find a singular place that is so appropriate for any occasion. \n\nParking really isn't a terrible problem.

I'm not going to repeat everyone else's reviews so I'll just contribute a few suggestions here.  First, for white wine lovers, go for the Emeri.  Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing!   And I haven't found anywhere else that carries this brand. Forego the glass, just get the whole bottle if you have someone to share it with.  This is a good place for a dates or hanging out with a few friends (more intimate, smaller group), not as great for a big group.  My recco is not to do dinner there (though their grilled cheese and soup is delish and the apple & brie bruschetta rocks too) but go for the wine and leave room for dessert.  They are all delicious.  The portion sizes are just right for sharing.  Creme brulee is my favorite and the salted caramel sundae is also divine (chocolate covered corn nuts? who knew these were so tasty!).    If you aren't in a wine mood  - though why would you be at a wine bar then - the Mr. Qcumber Soda is a unique little refreshing beverage.

Do not pass up the bruchetta.  You can mix it up by choosing four over sized pieces for $12.  I love the arugula/buratta and mozz/basil/tomato but fig and cheese is the winner!  All sans meat but positive feedback on the meat selections.  We shared a generously plated cheese board ($14) and the pub board consisting of fresh pretzel-like bread, spicy nuts, cheese bits and a tasty mustard.  My friend also like their broccoli cheese soup.  I've had the vegetarian panini in the past which I enjoyed although the humus was a little overpowering and messy. I'd get it on the side next time. The salad served with it is phenomenal. \n\nThe wait staff at both locations are great.  I felt bad for walking in 15 minutes before closing last night but I really, really wanted my friends to eat there.  We were greeted with a friendly face and our waiter was very attentive and conversational despite the time. We weren't rushed and were able to enjoy catching up over a bottle of wine and tasty meal on a perfect for patio evening. \n\nDownside is parking. The place was bare last night so that wasn't a problem. Friday/Saturday night is going to be a fight.  Also, they will not take reservations of less than six and WILL NOT seat you until your whole party is available.  Not so good for the group I usually go with but we're all learning to be more timely!  It can be a long wait but worth it!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

The bruschetta also took an excessive amount of time to come and 2 of the cut pieces had fell of somewhere so we got jipped!  Let me say I once was a server for many years.

Just enough food for 2. Having Sierra Navada on the beer list is a great plus as well.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

It's always the last stop for food on the way back to California.  $20 for 4 choices of Nom Nom bruschetta & a bottle of wine is such a great deal!  You can choose not to have the bottle opened and to go it home! =)   Bruschetta assortment is just unbelievably great!  Definitely put me in a food coma on the 7 hour drive home.\n\n I rarely give 5 stars, but Postinos deserved it because the employees are soooo amiable consistenly checking up on our table. With such a long day in Sedona I had 8-10cups of water and there wasn't a moment I had to \"ask\" for water like other establishments.  Employees must of had very keen eye-vision because it was quite dark in the room and they kept my water cup filled at all times.\n\n  I did have a little sip of Moscato from my friend's bottle and it's bubbly good!\n\n  Postinos... seee ya on my next road trip... or you can open up a location in southern california =)", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

We were waiting for around 45 min before we got a table but we were having fun nonetheless.  The bruschetta was amazing and there were many different types to choose from.

Got there at 7 p.m. and scored a table with no wait in the middle of the dining room.  Immediately I realized it was a little too loud for the audience with the music playing, but stuck it out.  I was meeting my friend's parents who were in town on vacation and thought it would be a nice, casual place with hopefully great wine and food.  They loved the architecture inside, with the exposed pipes and brick and large, open garage doors.  The patio was probably not quite as loud, but was full so we were definitely stuck inside.  \n\nI had a glass of $11 Malbec, which was fantastic.  We ordered the bruschetta and I im in love with the artichoke version as well as the apple and brie.  I was not blown away by the mozzerella and tomato, which I thought I had heard was a guaranteed good time.  I also got the turkey panini though which I got with a salad.  It was bigger than any panini I've ever had and I took half of it home.  It had  a pesto sauce that made it the best panini I think I've had in my lifetime.  (Maybe I've had ten paninis though in my lifetime so take it for what it's worth.)  The salad I was not blown away by and was not disappointed when the waiter took it away while asking if he could take it away.\n\nService was a little slow, but again it was a Friday night.  The wait staff is a friendly, helpful group and didn't rush us as we sat and chatted while eating for three hours.  \n\nValet is $3, which is fair, but what is a riot is when you walk out, if you had your keys, you could walk the twenty feet and get your car yourself.  But instead, you have to wait behind five people for the valet to hand you your keys and THEN you walk to your car.  AFTER tipping of course:)\n\nOverall, I will go back for the paninis, maybe try a few other bruschettas.  It will be hard to not to to LGO next door though...", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now since I have been hearing and reading great things through yelp. I mean how great can panini's and bruschetta actually be? More on that later. \nThe actual building itself was pretty cool. A nice chill vibe that wasn't overbearing with pretentiousness. Always a breath of fresh air. What kills this place is the crowd. I showed up about 2 PM. and the crowd was casual and just having a good time. As the time got later the typical Arcadia yuppie / trendy crowd began coming in. Totally killing the atmosphere. I don't know why so many people in Scottsdale and Phoenix are like this, I don't get it. It's not attractive, you look like douche bags. I swear it seems as though there is a clan of people on yelp all yelping together to write great reviews, because it's what they like, so gay. \nOK, now for this food review, it's strictly for the bruschetta's. Honestly I don't know why people praise somethings. I tasted four of them. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil. Tomato Jam and fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese. Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, and Tomatoes. And Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Let me get one thing clear, they all tasted good, and yes some were more impressive than others, but come on it's a slice of bread with a topping, not really a culinary masterpiece. Although I will give props to the Tomato jam, that was delicious! \nAs an all around value of Postino, you really can't go wrong. The prices match what these items should be priced at, and solid drink deals. I would definitely go back if fellow friends suggest going there, but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back here.\n  But with all this being said, they have 2 locations and are opening up a third one.  So props to the owners, they have marketed a concept and people are loving it so they're doing something right in many people's opinions.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

The crowd was light at 5 and we chatted for a good hour or so before ordering our first bruschetta board. You get 4 pieces of each selection and you can select 4 different types. The apple fig one was amazing of course the classic tomato mozzarella was to die for. The prosciutto and date melted in your mouth! We gnawed on that for about 30 mins then ordered another to try 4 more!

I have been to Postino's 4-5 times and usually bring someone who hasn't been before....clients for happy hour/husband for lunch, etc. Although their patio isn't large, it is my favorite area and I recently found out they are dog-friendly. Happy hour here is the best....the appetizer menu with different kinds of Bruscetta is unreal. Don't be afraid to dive into their wine and beer menu - if you haven't heard of a label, ask your waitperson. They have obviously been well trained and give great advice. Speaking of the wait staff - they deserve high points. Even when this place is packed, they show up promptly....if fact, we had 2 or 3 different people stop by and ask if we needed anything. My favorite thing on the lunch menu (alas, I've not had dinner here yet) is the proscuitto and Brie panini. This mere \"sandwich\" is my diet Kryptonite...and worth it! Every bite is a food orgasm of salty proscuitto,warm gooey Brie slathered with sweet fig jam.

The soup was just OK - it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as exciting for my tastebuds as the panini. \n\nI would liken my dining experience at Postino to \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" -- after I had one phenomenal item, I had to have them all! After polishing off a bold and zesty Syrah from California, I ended up leaving with a bottle of the Reunion Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina.

Although she listed Postino Wine Cafe, I was brought to this location and I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.  The staff was knowledgeable on their wine selection and provided great service.  The cork on my bottle of Pinot Noir had \"Wine Crystals\" or Wine Diamonds\", nothing I had seen before.  The server was very informative on explaining what it was, turns out I did my own research and the information provided was very accurate.  http://winesworld.com/index.php/wine-crystals/68/  \n\nAlso, If you are a fan of music, on the Friday night that I was there, they played music by The Whitest Boy Alive, The XX, Phoenix, Hercules & Love Affair and Band of Horses to name a few.  I was tapping my toe as some of these are on my own personal playlist so it instantly gained a few stars for the music alone.   Next, I'm coming back for Sangria Sundays and reggae.

Long-haired young guys with slightly nasal voices talked about multi-timbral effects, VCO's and VCA's, attack, sustain, decay. I can still hear the simulated sounds of shakuhatchi flutes playing the first few notes of \"Sledgehammer\" by Peter Gabriel--loudly enough to rattle windows. \n\nI'm sure the equipment that got purchased here played more than a few weddings where white people embarassingly trudged around in some drunken fashion to \"Take On Me\" or \"Celebrate\".  Perhaps some of the current patrons were those very same dancers. Like the older guy who complimented me on my fishing vest.\n\nBut anyway, about the salad. It was good. I opted for the prosciutto as an add to the Italian salad. On the side was a good glass of tempranillo. There was a tang to it. \n\nA tang. Yes. A tang which recalled a layered gong effect combining additive and subtractive synthesis--something one might hear from say -- a Korg DW8000--which used sampled waveforms modulated through analog filters. That's exactly what the tempranillo reminded me of.\n\nWhen the waitress brought my check I realized that she looked a bit like Siouxsie Sioux, a few years on and minus the make up. Or perhaps it was Lene Lovitch. \n\nAnyway, make time to enjoy a visit to Postino.

On this trip to Phoenix, my friend J thought it was a must to experience Postino! We arrived around 8pm and thought it best to use the valet.  We were so happy that we were able to get a table.  Postino's is absolutely darling.  Our server recommended an earthy red wine that J took advantage of and loved.  I had the sparkling Sauvignon Blanc (delightful!) and our friend R had Framboise.  This is a wine and beer place, so those hoping for other spirits are out of luck.  For those that love wine... this is an excellent place to spend some quality time.  Fabulous wine selection!  \nAs for the food... we were happy with everything we ordered except one thing, which I will save for the end of my review.  Postino regulars recommend the bruschetta and everyone seems to have a different favorite.  This is a fun food to order because you are able to choose 4 of the selections.  Fun decision to make with so many great selections!  My top two faves were 1. bacon, arugula and tomatoes (loved this combo!) and 2. warm artichoke spread (excellent!).  R + J loved the prosciutto w/figs and mascarpone.  So highlight of our night was the fun and delicious bruschetta!\nWe also shared olives (meh) and the prosciutto panini.  I enjoyed the panini but my dining partners were crazy about it.  \nThe best and worst of the night were our desserts.  We couldn't decide which one to order, so we got two.  One rocked our world and the other was ho-hum.  The Creme Brulee was the BEST Creme Brulee I have tasted.  Beyond words delish!  The Chocolate Bouchon was not noteworthy.  As my friend Beti would say, \"It wasn't worth the calories.\"  \nI may have mentioned the word \"fun\" a few times in this review but that is such a perfect description of Postino.  If I lived in Phoenix, you would positively catch me here on a Monday or Tuesday night for their amazing $20 house bottle of wine and bruschetta special.

You can choose 4 different types for $13.50. The bread was perfectly soft and all the toppings were excellent. If I had my way, I could eat this all the time.

Fucking awesome.\n\nAs you'll read in most of the other reviews, Postino has a great Monday and Tuesday night special, a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board for only $20.

Perfect for bruschetta. My favorite was the salmon, and the roasted pepper one was quite delicious. I even enjoyed the dates and pistachio bruschetta, but probably wouldn't order it again.\n\nTraditional brushcetta is an appetizer for which I measure any Italian restaurant. The fresh bruschetta here was way too salty, could hardly taste the fresh tomato and basil, which appeared to be fresh and of good quality. Why would you over-salt fresh brushcetta? Major fail, and one of the reasons this place is getting 3 stars instead of 4. \n\nI may come here again though, I just know not to order the fresh bruschetta.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Usually, you get your parking validated when you dine in the restaurant.  \n\nStrike 2: We had a party of 7, and majority of our party was there.

We were waiting more than anyone in line!\n\nStrike 3: I asked for no cheese on my salad, and I got a buttload of cheese!\n\nStrike 4: It felt like it was 90 degrees in there.  With the kind of money their business makes, they can keep the A/C at 80 at least!\n\nStrike 5: The tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted kind of frozen or 2-3 days old.\n\nI know there are a lot of great reviews, but I had a pretty bad experience.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

We went on Monday, when they have a $20 deal for a bottle of wine and a plate of bruschetta. The wine that they serve is their \"house\" wine, but it knocks the socks off of your typical house wine. The Bruschetta makes a great meal by itself if you want. There are 11 choices (various toppings) and you can have up to four different ones per plate (really a long-handled cutting board, which makes for a nice presentation). The Bruschetta is carefully sliced into smaller pieces so that several people can try each kind. Be prepared to eat and drink a lot; it is such a deal that you will have a hard time saying \"no.\"\n\nI mostly stuck to the beer that was on draft. There were only two choices, both very good. The draft beer was fresh and refreshing, plus at $7.50 for a small pitcher anytime it was quite a deal. If you come for the earlier happy hour it is $5/pitcher or $5 for a glass of wine, so you can't go wrong. It makes sense to have a small draft beer selection since they are a wine bar and it helps them move through the kegs quickly. I ordered the prosciutto with brie panini, which I had no trouble sharing with my friends. You get the choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread and fresh-made chips or salad- the chips and ciabatta bread were great. Our server helped me pick the ciabatta bread, which she accurately described as the \"thinner, crispier\" one for my panini.\n\nThe service here is amazing. Our servers were very patient and helpful. The busser would give any Indian restaurant a run for their money with his diligent water-refilling, plus he was thoughtful enough to get our server's attention if we needed anything else. Everyone was dressed nicely and very friendly. At one point a piece of bruschetta fell onto the table or the floor. Without even mentioning it, out server brought over a replacement. She must have noticed from somewhere else in the restaurant and wanted to help.\n\nThe restaurant had a very appealing atmosphere. Lights were dim, but not dark. The colors on the walls made it feel vibrant. Chairs and tables were comfortable, well-maintained, and fit in with the style of the restaurant. It might have been louder if we sat inside, but we were on the patio. Outside we sat in the shade (we arrived when it was still daylight) and the water misters helped keep us cool. The bathrooms are in the back corner, opposite of the front door. You might have to ask a server to point out where to go, but they are glad to help. The fact that the bathrooms simply say \"Both\" could be an interesting conversation point if you have to wait in line.\n\nThe parking is valet, but you shouldn't be driving anyway. Take a cab if you can help it, or bring a designated driver. The experience is so nice that you won't want to leave, unless maybe you make a friend to bring with you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

We went on a Sunday afternoon (right around 12pm) and had no issues with parking.  We scored a spot in front of the restaurant just as someone else was leaving.\n\nThe place was fairly busy and our party of two was immediately seated at a low table in the front (right by the acoustic musician).  Postino was well decorated and has a ton of seating options.  We wanted to fall in love with this place but just ended up liking it slightly. \n\nWe ordered the butchers block and the bruschetta plus cucumber lemonade and iced tea.\n\nWhile everything was okay, I wasn't knocked out of my socks.  My favorite part ended up being the butchers block rather than the bruschetta.  I think the issue that they have is that it is not crispy enough.  The bread was under-toasted and it made for a very chewy experience.  We ordered the Salmon pesto (the smoke flavor is weak and the pesto is strong so it misses there), Burratta, bacon, arugula and tomato (while our waitress claimed this to be her favorite, we were underwhelmed here too.  The bulk of the flavor came from the bacon and the arugula), tomato, basil and mozzarella (my favorite combo done wrong!  There was NO flavor to this and they should have at least provided an olive oil or balsamic drizzle to give it some pop.  The tomatoes weren't fully ripe either and were at the pink stage so they hadn't developed their true tenderness) and Prosciutto, fig and marscapone (by far our favorite since the flavor profile gave us a little bit of sweat, savory and salty).\n\nAll-in-all the place wasn't bad.  Based on the reviews though I just expected a wee bit more from my experience here.  I liked that they have live entertainment on the weekend although it makes it hard to hear when you are seated to close.\n\nI saw some folks sitting outside although I am not sure of how they survived in 110 degree weather.  On cooler nights though, I can see that being a nice place to hang.\n\nOh, I also didn't appreciate having to battle flies for my food.  They kept the door open which meant every critter wanted to beat the eat and join the tables. \n\nNot sure about returning as I've had this food concept before except with better execution.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Sangria Sundays are the absolute best, with a great staff, everyone is always in a fabulous mood- and the Sangria is to die for. I take everyone who hasn't been to Postinos there, given the chance. The only rough part is the parking- that's usually the case in Arcadia, but I found a secret spot recently, I won't disclose here so no one takes it. LOVE Postino's food, service, and atmosphere.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!\n\nMy favorite menu items are still the same too:\nThe artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!\n\nI'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!  \n\nService is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!\n\nOf course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.

Service has more spunk and personality at this Postino location too. Try the cucumber lemonade if you don't like wine or just plain water.

If you haven't been to Postino's, you are missing out! They have awesome happy hour specials - $5 for the equivalent of 2 glasses of wine (if that's your poison) or a mini pitcher of beer which comes out to about 2 1/2 glasses of beer. That little for booze?! Sign me up!!! Mondays (I think it's Monday...) all bottles of wine are half off! They feature a lot of local wines and hard to find wines. This is the place where I first fell in love with Moscato. I can't say enough about their Moscato except that it is delicious!\n\nTheir bruschettas are very tasty and hands down the best I've ever had. They get creative with their toppings and there's something to please palettes of all kinds. If I had to narrow down my top 4 favorites, I would choose: the apple, brie, and honey; fig, marscapone, and pistachio; the mozzarella, basil, and tomato; and finally the prosciutto and fig.\n\nDownside - parking can be tough since this place is usually hopping. But they offer valet at a staggering price of $3. That's right - 3 bucks. Not too bad to have someone park your car 20 feet away. Also, the service can lag at times depending on how busy they are.

Their salted caramel desert sunday is totally worth leaving room for!  This is a great place for a get together with friends or an intimate date night.  The service is always great and everyone who works there really knows their wine - so you can get advice from your server on which wines will meet your tastes each month when the new list comes out.

They seem to take pride in their cheese diversity, but I was simply not impressed.\n\nThe service was great, the ambiance was relaxing, and the patrons were nice.. I truly enjoyed my visit and will be returning to this establishment. It wasn't expensive, but it isn't cheap nor should it be.

Seems to be a place where all they serve is Brushetta at crazy prices again. It's 14 bucks for 4 pieces of toast with various stuff on them. Personally, brushetta will always just be olive oil, tomatoes and basil on grilled toast. Never tried the food because they have no Happy Hour food deals.

Expect an extremely long wait if you get there after 8pm\n\nWhat to order (in order of tasty): [Bruschetta] Tomato jam and goat cheese, fig and prosciutto, Apple and brie, pesto and salami, pistachio and date, caprese (lacks balsamic vinegar and olive oil). [Other] Olives.\n\nDon't bother getting: white bean hummus is pretty insipid and the artichoke dip doesn't add much to your meal, nor is on discount during their Monday specials.\n\nBest group number: 2-4 is pretty perfect. Anything more will be hard to accommodate as the space is pretty small.\n\nOverall impression: ridiculously good deal on Monday to share with 4-5 people, paying only $8-10 to get sufficiently tipsy and full. Location is classy, service is pretty decent but be aware that the parking situation sucks as the lot in front of it will tow you for parking there.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Whether its the service you get , the food quality, the ambiance or the amazing deals... its all been said. But hell, I will say it all again..\n\n~Fud/Drink~\nI have had bruschetta many times, at many places. They do bruschetta the RIGHT WAY. They give you so many different options to choose from, and each one tastes as good as the next. I am a salmon fan, so their salmon bruschetta was exquisite in my eyes. They have so many amazing wines to offer you as well, so many its almost impossible to not find the right fit for your meal. I have yet to try other main entrees on the menu, but do not worry I will. Just remember, you can taste the quality. They take good care of their product and make sure the kitchen pumps out quality dishes.\n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nThe Servers really know their stuff. They understand why you're their and they seem to really rock to the vibe of the place. Hipsters love it, I love it, and the servers are awesome at what they do. The suggestions they provide prove to really help make the night a better one. The atmosphere is great, a real hipster vibe for sure. I enjoy a relaxed calm spot personally, especially after a long day at work, and  they nail it. Its just quiet enough to sit down and relax with someone special, yet loud enough that no one can hear your conversation.\n\n~Extras/Rating~\n\nRegarding the $20 Bruschetta/Wine deal: GET-THERE-EARLY. Or else you might find yourself waiting for an hour to get served. I do not fault them for having to put you on a long wait-list, especially because its such an amazing deal and so popular just suck it up and get there earlier or 30 minutes earlier than what you would normally want. Their $20 Bruschetta/Wine pairing is the best happy hour item I have ever seen. No lie. That alone puts them in the upper echelon for date night go-to's and perfect chill happy hour locations in the valley here. \n\n No one can lay claim to such a unique and perfect option, despite the fact that numerous other bars have attempted. They may try, but the quality of food and vast selection of wines, paired with the ambiance they provide, blows all competitors out of the water. The only thing I hate about this place, is that I didn't think of it first.. :) 5 stars because they deserve it, enough said.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

I loved this place and I will definitely come back every time I visit Arizona. \n\nDear Postino, open a location in San Francisco.

It was a Thursday night and surprisingly really busy. After walking in and not seeing anyone seating, we sat ourselves. The ONE hostess on duty then scolded us for doing so. Then after being confused, within 15 minutes three diff servers approached our table. One with water, one for a drink order and one to take our order. None of them smiled or seemed to care to wait on us, probably bc we weren't drinking wine. If it wasn't for the remarkable bruschetta and proscuttio sandwich, I would have left.

I am addicted to the bruschetta! I start craving it after a few weeks of not having it! In fact, I will go bread free and NOT have any bread .. SO I can load up on bruschetta when I come here. This place is packed.. No matter when you come here. I want to say get here 'early' , but truly.. there is no 'early' at Postino. Just get here! Get your name on the list and get your belly near the bar and get your drinks ordered. I usually never change things up too much. I love red wines and that is what I go with .. always. I like the $5 wines until 5pm. After that, if this is where my group is hanging , we generally go with the bottle then. The bottles are priced at 3x the amount of the glass price. Not bad and not hard to figure out. The meat board is great .. the cheese board is divine. All bruschettas ...mmmmmm. I've never done any desserts here. Maybe I should . But I usually am not a dessert girl. So I use my calories on wine, bread and cheese! I only brought my star down one as the last time I was here our waiter was to split the bill with me and my flight attendant friend from NYC. Instead, not only did he split it, he split and added the full cost to my card too! It took about 5 business days to correct! I'm still a fan, though.\nCatering: I catered a small gathering at my place with bruschettas and paninis . Perfect and on time.

Food is consistently delicious!! Parking is consistently crappy. You have to be one of the lucky 5 people to get a non-valet spot. If you don't, good luck finding street parking that isn't resident-only. Sometimes your only choice is valet. I guess I'm cheap, but it makes me angry that I have to tip a guy to walk 10 feet to get my car. Oh well.\n2 of the 3 times I have been the service was great. This last time, was not so great. I was in a large party (~10 people) and they sat us right away, which was awesome. The place was not very busy as we were there for a very early dinner on a Sunday (4pm). Our waiter took our drink orders at 4:15, they were delivered and then disappeared until 5 (which is, you guessed it, then end of Happy Hour). He came back at 5:01 on the dot. Kinda sucks. As we were all hungry and eager to order, but it was not until sometime later that he re-appeared for the food order. \\\n\nHe did the whole, \"I'm too awesome to write down any of your orders\" bit. Even though we were each getting an order of Bruchetta (which gives the option to choose 4). Luckily, he got our orders correct, but if he hadn't? I am not going to tip you more because you didn't write it down!  Even if you get it right 95% of the time, it's really crappy for that 5% that you mess up! Anyway, our food came and it was delish! \n\nWhen our bill came, I realized why he didn't show his face more than the few times over the 3 hours that we were sitting there....they pre-added in his tip. 20%! He was made whether he gave us good service or not. \n\nI will be going back because, like I said, I usually have great service and ALWAYS have great food....but this one encounter did put a sour taste in my mouth.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

It was very busy for a Sat. afternoon.  People were very friendly and we spent the 30 min wait at the bar with a couple of glasses of wine.  The bartender was very much on top of it.  We ordered three appetizers: Cheese plate, olives and tomato+ mozzarella.   All was very good.  The prices didn't make sense though.  I think the cheese plate was a fantastic value considering what you get.  But the tomato and cheese version was prob. not worth the money.  The bowl of Olives is what it is.  I liked it, my friend wanted some salty olives in there too which was all oil cured olives.  I am a fan and will go.  Just a side note; it seems that you have to have many visible tattoos to work here, so if you don't want your wait staff to be very casual and with lots of piercing etc. be warned.  Also, we saw a person who must have been a mgr scold a couple of the staff in front of everyone which I thought was not necessary.  Mainly because they weren't doing anything wrong secondly I am sure this could have been done in the back of the house.  Overall, nice atmosphere and loved the garage door open walls which gave the open air feel.  I liked how the bartenders were on top of it even though they were busy.  Our tap for the three apps and 4 glasses of wine was $50 plus a $10 tip makes it not a cheap place to just chill in the afternoon but I will be back prob. later in the evening for a happy hour or something.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

On a whim they took us to there favorite restaurant in the valley.  They brought us to this little wine bar named Postino that served bruschetta 10 different ways.  Let me tell you, I moved to Phoenix from Chicago about a year ago and more than the great weather and affordable living, Postino had a little something to do with me making the move.  I'm only kind of kidding.  This place is great, I've been here about 10 times the last year and it never disappoints.  Their bruschetta is delicious and totally affordable and I always tell my guests, we take all of our Midwest visitors here, the bruschetta is great but don't be afraid to hit up the sandwiches as well.  My favorite bruschetta must be the tomato jam with fresh sheep's milk cheese, it is unbelievable, all their bruschetta choices are great though.  I am not much of a wine guy, which is probably heresy when describing how great Postino is, but the beer selection here is just a good. If happy hours are your thing, Postino has these great happy hours that serve any pitcher of beer and any glass of wine for only $5 from 11AM-5PM seven days a week.  Seriously this is one of the best places to dine and chill in the valley.  The atmosphere is cool, lots of hip good looking people around, the music is low key, and the service is attentive and lively.  The servers know their stuff when it comes to wine and beer.  If I had to recommend one place to anyone coming to the Valley for work or play, this would be the spot.  It really can't be missed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

The Arcadia location is in a cool neighborhood and the building opens up on one side to an outdoor patio... which is awesome on an evening with nice weather.\n\nI have to admit, I haven't tried very much from the menu.  Every time I come, the rest of the table and I order bruschetta to share and some wine.  Although I'm sure the rest of the food is great, I really do recommend bruschetta.  There are 12 different varieties to choose from, with everything from the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil to brie with apple slices to prosciutto.  Every single one is delicious.  They work well for one order for two people, so order accordingly.  For our group of 4, we got 2 orders.  With four varieties each, we got to try 8 of the 12 available.  It was easiest to say that we'd try one of everything, with the exception of the ones that had an ingredient someone at the table would prefer to skip.\n\nWe also split a bottle of wine, which complimented the meal very well.  Our server was knowledgeable enough to recommend a bottle based on what we were in the mood for, and he really hit the mark.  We were amused that the woman whose job it was to fill water glasses would come around so often that the glass never got below half empty.  It was almost too much, but hey, we stayed well hydrated.\n\nThe atmosphere is very \"cool\" with dim lighting, modern decor, and a definite wine theme throughout.  Service has been excellent each time I've dined here.  Those are perks for sure, but the bruschetta would keep me coming back anyway!  Check out any of the Postino's that may be near you!  If you go in on Monday or Tuesday after 8, their date night special is a bruschetta platter and a bottle of wine for $20.  Can't beat that!\n\nKeep in mind that Postino Arcadia is valet parking only ;)", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

I prefer the savory over sweet. \nExcellent wine and beer selections - they've got your standards plus the locals plus some unique options that'll keep you busy.\nPrice is right - I'll gladly share my student loans + interest with Postino, even after 5pm as I did last night with a group of friends.\n\nI will say the cheap Asian in me isn't a fan of the valet parking (it's not always there, though). They are lucky I'm too lazy to walk in the heat of summer. My mother would be so disappointed if she knew I paid for valet.  \n\nAs a new transplant just down the road, I have a feeling I'll be back many times.

As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of ingredients).  \n\nIf this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good. \n\nAside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic. \n\nMost importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta!

I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.

Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just \"you ready to order?\"\n\nWe ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.\n\nThe wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.\n\nYet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.

Overall a great experience and coming back again to enjoy the bruschetta board.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Which definitely came in handy in terms of hiding our slight shame when the onslaught of food and booze arrived at our tiny little table for 2!\n\nIn true fattiness, we ordered enough food to feed a family of 5! And of course with their happy hour offerings for wine and beer it was too awesome to pass up on! \n\n1. Selection of 4 Bruschetta's: pretty good variety of options, ingredients were fresh, generously portioned and flavor combinations worked. My only problem was the bread to goods ratio. Even though I am a thorough carbivore, it was a bit too much bread for my pref and I tend to like less dense bread for my bruschetta. Nonetheless a great deal for $14!\n\n2. Autostrada Panini - I am not one to pass up on any meat, on meat, on meat, on meat action (yes, 4 types of salty cured pig parts...especially in regards to the Soppressata, LOL!)! And the spicy pepper relish was a nice added zing to bring together all that goodness. LOL!!\n\n3. Bella Postino (warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted MJ breads) - Probably...no...definitely could have done without this given the amount of food we already ordered but still a good staple to order if you're here with more than 2 people! Haha!\n\nAnd then on to the best part! They have a great happy hour where their wine by the glass and PITCHERS of beer are just $5!! Loved that there were so many options! You seldom see that here in San Francisco. So it was quite glorious! There was definitely some remorse that I stuffed myself so much I didn't have more capacity to fully take advantage of it! \n\nSD also introduced me to a locally produced beer, I believe it was the HopShock? Pretty freaking delicious!\n\nGood food/booze and wonderful company certainly made this a very memorable meal! If I ever find myself in AZ again I will definitely revisit this place. Especially now that I have learned from my mistake of not properly allocating my stomach capacity for happy houring here! ^____^\n\n\"I am not a glutton, I am an explorer of food\" ~ Erma Bombeck", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Both breads are good, but the focaccia is amazing.\n* The tomato jam bruschetta is probably my favorite item on the menu. It's a perfect \"dessert\" bruschetta for after you finish the others.\n* The raspberry chicken salad is AMAZING.\n* There's really no way to go wrong with any of their desserts, but my favorite was the vanilla creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nHonestly, I really hope I can find a place as amazing as Postino where I'm living now, but it's going to be tough to beat.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

This was by far the best grilled cheese I've had..ever and that says a lot. It was on a nice flaky break with the perfect amount of gooey-ness. It was served with a ketchup, fancy mustard, and pesto. Fabuloso!\n\nFor the entree - I had the tomato florentine - I felt like it was missing a spice, but it was still good. I had the chicken and mozzarella panini and the mixed greens salad. Albeit I was stuffed, it was amazing and tasted even better the next day.\n\nThe other perk is they have a focused menu. They aren't trying to be everything to everyone.

The special starts at 8pm, we got there over 45 min early one night and the wait was an hour and a half. I wish they would either extend the hours, get extra table or do something so they can accommodate all of their clients. They will accept reservations if you have a party of 8 or more. So last Mon. we called ahead and made reservations for our large group, we arrived 20 min early to ensure that they would have enough time to get our table ready and they told us that they just gave our tables away to 2 smaller groups.

I've been a regular here since I moved to the neighborhood over a year ago. However, there appears to be some staffing changes that are interfering with service.\n\nThe food and wine really are top of the line. There hasn't been a single morsel of food that has crossed my palate that I've disagreed with. Unfortunately the experience is not what it used to be, and for that I'm disappointed. If you're ok with extended wait time between glasses of wine, great. I'd recommend ordering a bottle of wine and being done with any further expectation of service. (Including water.)\n\nI've been visiting during off peak hours to ensure there would be no unnecessary wait time or standing around. (So, for example, 2pm for a lunch hour.) This is a wine bar. When you go, it would be nice to receive the wine you order. The last time we went I watched my wine sit at the bar. When my friend managed to flag down our server (fifteen minutes after we had placed our first order) what the status was he joked, \"I can't squeeze the grapes.\" (If it had been convenient/easy for me to move quickly I would have picked it up myself. Crutches, not so much.)\n\nSo not funny. I get it. You can get in the weeds. It's better to admit that.  But - maybe - call me crazy - check in your table more frequently the rest of the meal. We eventually were able to order a second a glass of wine. The wait time for vino was, alas, terrible.  \n\nI'm telling this story as an example of the service I've received as of late. There are others. I'm not sure what's happened or why. The upside to not having any table service (or much of it) is that you have ample time to speak to your table partners. Perfect for a date. Not so perfect if you're on a business lunch or in a rush at all. \n\nAnother option for speedier service might be to sit at the bar. The bar isn't terribly huge but offers comfortable seating. The bartenders are wonderful.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

I've been to 2 of them now and the one thing you can say about Postino, they are an amazing place to dine/drink and they are very consistent with service, quality and ambiance.  \n\nWe typically go the Postino on Central, however we dined here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and found them to be fantastic! I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a \"must come back\" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!\n\nFood~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!  \n\nHowever if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!  \n\nBruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!  \n\nPaninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!! \n\nService~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.\n\nAll in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!! My friends and I are looking forward to coming back on a Monday or Tuesday when they have their $20 special, a bottle of wine and burchetta ~ put me down for 2 please!

It was good and I can see if u want something different and unique how it would be good. But the cheese they used was weird and kinda gross to me. It was one if those weird name funky cheeses and that is the point but just not my kind if food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, \"How could you not order this?\" while we waited for our table.  \n\nMy friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.  \n\nOnce seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)\n\nWe surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty. \n\nBut if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.\n\nIf for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand. \n\nMake sure to ask for Bethany! She's the sweetest thing!", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

On the way back home from the airport my friend and I decided to stop for a nosh and wine.  When we got there late afternoon, we were welcomed immediately and cheerfully and seated promptly.  As soon as were seated, one of the wait staff brought us water and took our order for a bottle of Caparza.   It was a lovely Italian, a fill bodied Sangiovese Tuscan but not as murky as a Chianti.  It was delicious from the first sip to the last drop.  If you like Italian reds, this is a really good one.                                                                                           We next ordered our food and my friend ordered the bruschetta, I wanted a panini and settled on the autostrada.  One of Postino's delights is to choose your favorites when ordering the bruschetta s there are some wonderful choiced. He ended up with the salmon, caprese, artichoke and the green apple toasts. Each one offers a unique blend of flavors and no one does it better than Postino.  The Autostrada panini has all the right meats and cheeses but I am not a fan of the arugula and tomato.  I took those off and added them to my side salad and took a bite.  Each bite took me back to a stop I made on the way from Naples to Salerno where I had a similar panini with such wonderful flavors.                                                                                                                  The food and wine would earn this wonderful restaurant five stars but the Postino service by committee is not my favorite.  It creates uneven service and no one seems totally responsible for your table.  Other than that, Postino continues to be a wonderful gem in the Arcadia neighborhood and highly recommended.

We are a Sunday Morning look for a great breakfast kind of people.  Our best friends told us that this place in the Arcadia district was now serving Brunch from 9AM and to check it out.  We arrived like 9:15AM with much apprehension as we were the only couple in the place.  The menu was limited but looked decent.  Oh My Goodness!  My wife ordered the Ciabatta French Toast.  Now she claims to just hate Ciabatta bread, but she was not in the mood for eggs.  ***** That was the 5-star rating she gave the dish as it was (as she admitted) the best French Toast she ever tasted.  I on the other hand always go for the biggest dish, so I ordered their Farm Scramble - Eggs, potatoes, onions,  \"secret\"  herbs of some sort and two kinds of cheese.  It came with a  salad of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes.  I had to take the salad even though I don't \"ever\" have salad for breakfast.  I moved the salad to one side and licked off the fork .... The best tasting dressing I had tasted in years.  So I finished off the salad (that I never eat) and dug into the eggs ... Yum Yum Yum, I now have a new favorite breakfast dish.  You want a Mimosa to go with the meal?  Order  up.  We are going back this Sunday with our friends and I would highly recommend it to everyone.  A couple at another table told us that if we thought that the Brunch was good, we should come in for dinner as those meals were out of this world.  Oh .... by 9:45AM every seat in the restaurant was occupied.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

Inside has been redecorated and there is a really nice patio for you outdoors folks. No need to check your mail here. Just order what looks good and they deliver it right to your table.\n\nStarted with the Butcher's Block Starter plate and an ice cold Italian Beer. It was beautiful and tasty at the same time. Decided to go with the famous Bruschetta next. What did we not try is the question. There are so many choices.\n\nBrie & Apple with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Warm Artichoke Spread, the yummy Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and a few others that were not so great.\n\nWe all enjoyed anything with Figs on it. The plates were very colorful and the quality of the food was very high and fresh. Sounds like a good portion of their products come from right here in the valley. Nice!\n\nRecommend coming here during the day and not at night. The lighting is very dim and we had to use a flashlight app on my phone to see the food and menu. Maybe I'm justing getting too old for the late night thing.\n\nSeen other reviews saying that the best areas to sit are on the patio or right between the inside and outdoor seating area. Not sure how that works when it is a crisp 118 degrees outside. I bet the cheese starts melting rather fast.\n\nDefinitely a fun and enjoyable time. The Bruschetta is out of this world and a new favorite of mine. Looking forward to trying out some of the other locations.

Expectations may have been off, as we came here for a nice dinner, but this place probably should be treated more as a trendy appetizer or drink spot. Great atmosphere and service, and at one point could picture having a large group together on the large seating area in the back. Not really sure what I'm missing though, the bruschetta was good-not-great, and if you don't feel like a salad or panini for an entree, your options seem limited. For a trendy drinking hole, there could've been a few more than 4 beers on tap. As tasty as Deschutes River Ale is, there are usually more options in most other bars that offer any craft beer. Didn't take a serious look at the wine list this time around. Trying many different kinds of bruschetta in one order was a nice way to taste many things, and appreciate that they were trying interesting ingredients such as the tomato spread, but again, nothing I'll be remembering or craving. Would like to try the butchers block if there's another visit. Didn't try the dessert, as La Grande Orange is right next door, and our loyalties are there for sweets. The outdoor patio looked inviting, and would like to kick it there when its not so Phoenix-y in the middle of summer.

It tasted like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before waitstaff had gotten around to picking it up and delivering it to me. Ultimately it came out kind of cold, but it was still incredibly good, so I can't complain too much (except I can because I'm Korean like that and prefer it when my food is hot off the fire hot and my drinks are icy cold).\n\nI also had a glass of white wine which was completely forgettable, Hannah's field salad, and 1/2 Tuscan Tuna Sandwich.  I don't typically go for tuna sandwiches, but it sounded perfect, and the pickles and the mustard added just the right hint of piquancy.  The salad was nice too, though a little sweet for my tastes; all in all, it paired nicely with the tuna sandwich.  I love the kale and quinoa combo.  \n\nThis is a fun place to come with friends, so that you can share all of the different types of bruschetta.  If I came back and didn't order anything but a few different bruschetta, I wouldn't feel like I missed out. :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "SDwYQ6eSu1htn8vHWv128g"}

It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.\n\nOur reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.\n\nPostino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.\n\nGranted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.\n\nWe took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix.

But anyways Liberty Market is worth a try and Im sure you will want to go back. It kinda reminds me of a cooler version of La Grande Orange.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

The first trip, my wife and I just went in for coffee - and unfortunately we had already eaten dinner and dessert.  I had a cappuccino which did not disappoint, and required no augmentation - and my wife got her usual decaf americano with splenda and milk.  The desserts we saw looked fantastic - and apparently we were there for one of Joe's friend's birthday and they had these fantastic looking cupcakes (how did I know?!)\n\nSecond trip was with my brother, mom, and step-dad for dinner.  I ordered the farmer sandwich (veggies + goat cheese) which was delicious, and a perfect size.  Not too large, not too small.  Bro ordered the sloppy joe extra spicy - it was good, but not knock your socks off.  Mom and step-dad ordered pizza (1/2 cheese, 1/2 pep), I tried a small piece, it had a great sauce, fresh cheese, and a crisp + chewy crust.  They also split a mixed greens salad which looked fantastic.\n\nWe ordered dessert which was a granola bar (awesome), brownie (great reports, but alas, no walnuts for this nut), and I got a slice of pumpkin-apple bread to go (eventually tried this at home and was yummy).\n\nThe decor is really nifty - there is an open kitchen that runs almost the entire indoor portion of the restaurant.  There is a wood-fired pizza oven and it looks like a prep-kitchen in the back.  The drinking glasses are actually glass, and all of the tables are nice dark wood with very comfortable chairs.\n\nI over-heard Joe talking to another table about not advertising just yet to make sure that all of the kinks are worked out.  He also mentioned later when I was ordering coffee that the cupcakes were a special event dessert and might not be a regular item.\n\nThe entire staff is incredibley friendly and made the experience that much better.  It's too bad that Gail W. had such a bad experience - and also too bad that there is no real detail in the review.\n\nGive it a try - you won't be disappointed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

He MADE my dining night. Walked in for the first time on a monday evening, approached the coffee bar and started to talk to the barista a bit about how the design is amazing, perfect balance of modern and country. Wonderful coffee and at the end the barista extended his hand for a shake and said, 'By the way, my name is Joe.\" I was astonished by this. He checked in with me and my party the whole night just talking about food, all the equipment, and just tales of opening. He truely is what all resturant owners need to live up to. He seems to have a king midas touch, Coffee Plantation (before he sold it), Joe's Real BBQ, Joe's Farm Grill, and now Liberty Market are all his. I now understand why they are so popluar.

After reading several reviews in the paper about Liberty Market, and being fans of Joe's Farm Grill and Real BBQ, we were determined to get in here.  We parked in the back and as we walked along the sidewalk next to Liberty Market we noticed the long line trailing out of Joe's Real BBQ and then noticed the crowd inside Liberty Market.  I was instantly impressed that someone can be so successful in today's shaky market and open restaurant after restaurant with business just booming.\n\nAs we walked in we noticed that there was a line in which you stand to order your food at a counter.  We joined the line and read the menu.  Already having decided on a margherita pizza, we also chose the caprese salad and I knew I wanted a glass of pinot noir.  As we stood, I noticed that there were very few empty tables and I mentioned to my husband that maybe I should snag a table.  I had my eye on one table but as I walked toward it someone else apparently also had their eye on it and sat there first.  I bolted over to the only other empty table that I saw.  I sat for several minutes, watching my husband inch his way up to the counter.  A manager lady came over to me and asked me if I had someone standing in line.  I said yes.  She informed me that they usually like people to all wait in line and then order before sitting at a table.  I looked back at her and thought about the fact that there were no empty tables.  I said okay, but I held on to my table.  So that part was a little stressful.  The couple next to me joked around saying that I wasn't following the rules and may end up getting kicked out of my table.  Thankfully my husband was finally able to order and made his way over to our table.\n\nWe sat close to several other tables which seemd to invite conversation from all sides.  We chatted with all the people around us which was fun.\n\nOur food came and it was delicious!  The pizza was perfectly cruncy and chewy.  The caprese salad was very tasty.  We devoured every last bite.\n\nOn our way out we were lucky to see Joe, the owner, and were able to compliment him on his wonderful restaurant.

But imho his real claim to fame is the fact that he was one of the founders of Coffee Plantation--if you can remember as far back as when CP was actually a great place to go.\n\nIf you head into Liberty Market, you'll find an espresso bar with an old-school machine making pretty tasty drinks, including store-made proprietary hot chocolate (which was a hallmark of Coffee Plantation.  Starbucks?  Pah).\n\nMy wife, co-yelping, says the baked goods are better than the food, and since the red velvet cake is part of that category, I'd have to agree.  The red velvet cake is--and I mean this--the best slice of cake I've ever eaten.  And I've had my fair share.  The cream cheese frosting is fucking ridiculous, it's so creamy and cheesy.  If it were chilled the way such a cake should be (I think their bake case needs repair) I'd seriously go buy three cakes and just eat till I died, Seven style.\n\nBut the sandwiches are good too, and the ambience is quaint and charming--as Joe's places always are.  I don't want to wantonly toss my stars out to every half-decent place because let's be honest--not every place is a five-star restaurant.  But this place is pretty damn good and charming, so I'd recommend a visit.\n\nMy wife's yelp: \"I loved the red velvet cake, very cute place, nice atmosphere.\"  She's a lover of brevity (and poorly hung yet redeemingly charismatic men).", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

Not only are there those 2 destination worthy places to chow, but Hale Centre Theatre which offers live performance theatre for post eating entertainment. The icon for downtown Gilbert is a massive water tower that is just amazing to stand by. I know its just a water tower but the history, being built in 1923, and the scale, 123 feet tall, it's quite a sight to stand underneath. With a 3 million dollar renovation and new park surrounding the tower, it's both modern and well, cool. \n\nHere is some good news if you're a fan of Joe's Real BBQ or Joe's Farm Grill; restaurateur Joe Johnston also owns Liberty Market. So you'll know right away that there will be high quality and tasty food at very affordable prices. This is also due to the fact that Chef David Traina and his wife Kiersten are pretty much running the show at Liberty. Both were so helpful that we felt like we were honored guests; as I'm sure most will feel when visiting. Chef David came from behind the open kitchen and greeted us personally. His gorgeous wife Kiersten was so helpful as she had many recommendations from the menu and drink list as we ordered. Its customer service like this that will not only make you a loyal guest, but you'll quickly share this experience with your friends.\n\nBuilt in 1935 the building has been lovingly restored into that retro-American-modern feel that the other restaurants have. On a side note, be sure to check out the bathrooms, there are several in which to chose and each has its own theme. To get things moving along at Liberty you stand in line and place your order at the counter, then they give you a number to place on the table and when your order is ready they bring it out to you. There are quite a few places to sit including a large patio, main indoor dining room and a long bar overlooking the wood-burning oven. This is the place to be if you love to see your dinner being made before your eyes, its up close and very personal.\n\nDepending on what time of day you go the menu has its bases covered. From the coffee bar to a fun and interesting breakfast menu as well as the main menu, you might be hard pressed to just order one thing. The main menu is comprised of sandwiches, pizza's, salads and cold case offerings such a fresh hummus and potato salad. You may also be happy to know that they serve beer and wine to compliment your dinner choices, priced so well that you may want to try more than one if you're not driving.  Be sure to take a look at the wall of kitschy gift items like bear shaped salt and peppershakers and Party Snaps. Who didn't play with those when they were a kid?\n\nBeing all about fresh and local we started with the Antipasto ($11), which was large enough to share between 4 big eaters. A large serving platter covered in Molinari and Sons cured meats, roasted Brussels sprouts, baby carrots, olives and slices of artisanal cheese were a delight. The grilled bread that came with the platter was a nice compliment to the deliciously salty cured meats. Instead of ordering the Caprese Salad ($8) we opted for the Caprese Sandwich ($7), which even came with a cold case side dish. The corn, tomato + bean side was a bounty of freshness from the crunchy corn to the smooth toothsome Navy beans. This was a real compliment to the wonderful flavors of the mozzarella, sliced tomato, fresh basil and balsamic on the sandwich. The Liberty Joe ($7) is a take on the classic Sloppy Joe enjoyed by millions of kids over the years. Tender ground beef in a rich and hearty tomato sauce a top a toasted bun, lots of love for this one. Mac and cheese was the only side that could have been chosen for this one, kid heaven!\n\nThe pizza's are all hand tossed and baked in a beautiful Renato wood-burning oven. The pizza crusts that come from this oven are lightly crisp, slightly charred and simply scrumptious! Starting with the White ($11) this one is not to be missed! If the combination of cream sauce and smoked mozzarella wasn't enough, wait till you taste the chopped bacon and tender pieces of chicken, oolala! Another sure fire hit was the Grilled Sausage ($10) covered in stringy mozzarella, roasted onions and tomato sauce. While the Molinari ($11) sounded great, the cooking of sliced cured meats makes them way to salty and intense for my taste, gamey.\n\nDesserts vary from day to day, so on our visit we had the pleasure of a slab of Red Velvet Cake ($5). If you've never had red velvet, please do. Moist chocolate cake covered in thick frosting of cream cheese delight. If you're in the mood for something a little different, order the Bread Pudding ($5). This was probably the lightest bread pudding I've ever had, which was more like French toast pillows swimming in a sea of creamy love.\n\nLoad up the car with friends and go ahead, make the trip to Gilbert and see what you had no idea existed.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

There weren't nearly enough crackers or toasts or whatever you want to describe them as for the amount of salmon. The \"dressing\" on the greens was almost nonexistent even though it had a pretty good flavor. The salmon and capers were good, but I've had better.\nThe pancakes were just overpriced. I don't think I should have to add in an extra 2 dollars or whatever it was for blueberries. The TINY amount of syrup they give you is ample enough for one pancake, not three. \nAnd the quesadilla? I just don't get their \"homefries\" or \"potatoes\" or whatever they call them. It's more like an onion casserole. They shove them inside the quesadilla, which is filled with eggs and chicken and salsa. It's HUGE. I would split this if I go again.\nThe coffee is SUPERB, though. Great flavor. Rich, robust and not bitter. \nParking is ample - there are a lot of places to park around the neighborhood, and the revitalization efforts of this \"historic\" neighborhood are noticeable. \nThe little market where they sell things isn't anything great. You can go to the farmer's market on Power Rd. and get better prices. And AJs has most everything else at comparable prices. (Yes, AJs prices are comparable to Liberty Markets). I do like the idea though. If they could procure items that were \"hard to find\" then this concept would play out nicely. \nMy overall observation, however, is definitely the flow of the service lines. ?? I really wish there was some other way to herd the cats...without making it awkward and anxiety ridden. \nThe decor is awesome though. It's a great concept - and I was actually a purveyor of the original Liberty Market, so I enjoy the Owner's commitment to keep the integrity of the building.

At the time it wasn't that busy, the restaurant was about half full and there was only one couple ahead of me at the counter when I ordered. I was there with my family of 4.\n\nThe Good\n - The restaurant was immaculate. Very clean and modern looking. Its a cool place.\n - The staff is very friendly. \n\nThe Bad\n - So... very.... slow....\nI'm not sure if she was new but the lady taking orders at the front counter was PAINFULLY slow. Watching her take the order of the couple of ahead of me was a lesson in patience. When it was my turn to place an order the experience was only slightly better.\n\nOnce my order was taken it took more than 10 minutes just to get our Cinnamon Roll.. and it was cold! They didnt even take a moment to throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds.\n\nIt took another 15 plus minutes beyond that for us to get our breakfast. By that time it had been more than 25 minutes since I ordered and my kids were bouncing out of their chairs with boredom. Considering how slow it was when we placed our order that is just WAY TOO LONG to wait for food.\n\nThe Eh..\nThe food was alright. If I take into consideration it cost $30 dollars it was a pretty poor experience. But on its own merit, the food was no better than OK. My biscuits and gravy were cold, the pancakes might have been OK but the syrup was terrible. \n\nFrankly, given the standards for great food set by Joe's across the street I expected way better and next time I'll just wait in line for the Farmhouse next door.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.\n\nMy wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.\n\nI was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.\n\nWhile we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.\n\nMy cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.\n\nThe cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.\n\nThe saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.\n\nTheir dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?  Where's the allure?\n\nSorry Liberty Market.  Our first trip was very disappointing, which means it will probably be our last.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

My wife and I tried Liberty Market last December as a dinner and a show deal paired with the theatre next door.  The rain was pouring and as we dashed in the warmth of exposed rafters and good ambience reassured us we had made the right choice. That was where the fun ended.  For such a fancy looking place, the stand in line ordering was a little bit of a letdown.  We ordered a margherita pizza, unaware that the pizzas are barely a snack for a single person.  The pizza was good, though a little scorched, but the wood fired oven gave it a very nice artisinal touch.  We filled our drink cups at the oversized soda fountain and sat at a table that afforded a picture window view of Downtown Gilbert, and the feeling was cozy until the hardwood bench began to cramp my backside.  The food didn't take long to arrive, and the wait staff was friendly and helpful, if a little unnecessary. Apparently their only function is to serve the food and refill drinks, from the self serve fountain.  The real mystery came after our meal when we made our way past a very clean, completely empty kitchen.  It seemed extraneous, but must see more use during breakfast hours.  Then, arriving at the unisex washroom with highly decorated closet toilets providing little barrier between myself, my wife, and a fairly loud and smelly gentleman next to me, I was forced to flee screaming into the night.

I famously said that I'd eat myself to death on their red velvet cake (more on that later) but had marginally less success with the rest of the menu.\n\nWell all that changed two visits ago.  My wife ordered the italia salad, which is sort of like an antipasto salad with garbanzo beans, kalamata olives (the lone blight on the salad, but I can appreciate that that's only my opinion), and italian meats with lettuce and tomatoes and all.  Totally delicious.  And I ordered the italian sausage pizza which is actually amazing.  Totally delicious.  It comes with ricotta cheese and onions, the ricotta being delightfully creamy and the pizza, on the whole, being perfect in every way.  Thinish crust (but not too thin) and just really flavorful.\n\nWe got all that last night, too, and it was amazing again, but the trip was marred by...\n\nthe worst customer ever to live.  If you see a mushroom-shaped woman probably in her mid 40s, wearing a visor on her mushroom shaped head, and a t-shirt with \"talk to the (paw print)\" emblazoned on the front, look out.  You'll recognize her by her disconsolate husband/significant other, who carries around with him the ethos of a beaten pet.\n\nWOMAN: I'll have the (five thousand different desserts to go) and the pecan bar.  But NOT the pecan bar that was cooked on the side of the pan.  I HATE that.\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay... what about that pecan bar right there.\nWOMAN: NO! Not that one.  Look. You can tell that that one was cooked on the side of the pan.  No, I want that one (the one predictably buried under thirty others).  That *should* be all right.  It looks okay.\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Uh.  Okay.  Sure.\nWOMAN: (orders fifty more things)\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: (rings up woman. she pays.)\nWOMAN: And MAKE SURE that I don't get the pecan bar because (points credit card menacingly at HAPLESS EMPLOYEE) I am *very particular* about this.  If it doesn't look right, I will send it right back.\nHAPLESS EMPLOYEE: Okay (reassuringly).  We will.

One) if my wife thinks you're an asshole, you are.  She's got a pretty long fuse for this sort of thing.  And yes, that's how come we're married.  Two) if you're fat, why would you act so... fat?  It just reinforces the fact that you're a great big fat person and what the hell?\n\nFat person code: (I am an authority)\n1. Don't act like if you don't get the exact pecan bar you want, that your life is OVER.  It may be true, but for fucks sake.\n2. Don't order a disgustingly fatty triple-super-size quadruple burger with extra mayo and then a large diet coke.  You get laughed at when you do this.\n3.  I would say DO diet and exercise but I'm fat and I think those two things are profoundly boring.\n\nAnyway, I know this has dragged on but I talk so that I can hear myself talk, and the same generally applies to my writing.  BUT: If you are from LM, I HOPE YOU READ THIS BECAUSE...\n\nOur red (please see updated below) velvet cake last night was (sorry about the parentheticals but the yelp-bots are to blame.) terrible**.  TERRIBLE!  We got it to go and whoever served it to us either grossly misunderstood the quality of what they were serving, or they should be fired.  I have (albeit indirect) experience with Joe (the owner/conceptual mastermind) and I am certain that if he knew that this five day old, dried up piece of cake were being given to customers, he would be upset. \n\nThere were even two people in line ahead of me trying to decide between the carrot and red velvet and I told them they should get red velvet, hands down.  YOU MADE A LIAR OUT OF ME, LIBERTY MARKET!  And for this, I won't forgive you unless I get a free slice of (do I even need to specify \"fresh\") red velvet cake.\n\nHaving said all of that, every restaurant has it's moments, bad or good, and I forgive that and on the strength of the usual red velvet perfection and the deliciousness of everything else, I give LM five stars.\n\n__________________\n\n**Red Velvet Update: I have been in twice since and this most recent time, Kiersten (one of the owners) gave me a new piece of red velvet cake.  And a pecan bar, from the middle of the pan no less!  But I want to make this clear, just in case it isn't: I love liberty market--it's exceptional.  And I really want everyone to know that I've had the RV cake many times before *and since* and it has, every time, been amazing.  I still hold that it is the best piece of cake I've ever had.  So it clearly was an aberration this time.  And the carrot cake is almost as good.  Really.  The bread pudding is totally sublime.  If you get a dessert there, you won't be disappointed.  I promise", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

The work that has been put into this space has payed off, and the pride the owners take in their business is evident.\n\nI've been here four times, once for lunch and the other times for dinner. They have a good menu that has expanded from my early visits. You order and pay at the counter. The pros of counter service far outweighed the cons every time I've visited. Joining a group of friends is as simple as saying hi, placing your order at the counter, and sitting down. This style of service really shines when I attend with #evfn. Very few restaurants handle our group of 40+ with so little hassle. This makes for a great place to hang out and meet up with people.\n\nWhen I had lunch here I had soup and a half size farmer's salad, the combo was on special. The minestrone hit the spot, and the salad was full of crisp, fresh vegetables. The salad and sandwich selection is good enough that I'd eat lunch here a few times a week if I lived or worked closer. For dinner the burger is my recommendation of the things I've tried. It was juicy and came with a good selection of condiments. I haven't had the opportunity to sample much of the new dinner menu. The grilled chicken pasta is pretty good, and I'm looking forward to trying the steak or the apricot glazed chicken on my next visit. I also hope to try their breakfast soon, I hear good things.\n\nMy only complaint is that the brewed tea by the soda fountain usually tastes old to me. No biggie, more reason to stick to drinks from E-61. The E-61 espresso bar makes some of the best drinks I've had in Phoenix. I can recommend the toddy, the chai tea, and the giant bowl of caffe mocha.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

This past one, I went by for EVTM (East Valley Thursday Morning) and hung out with 40-50 friends & strangers.\n\nI ate breakfast at LM for the first time and it was stellar. I got the demi-breakfast (scrambled eggs, meatball & pancake) and a bowl-a-ccino. The giant bowl of cappuccino was excellent, as is all the coffee I've had there. It was quite pretty as well with a very nice pour. \n\nI thought the food was remarkable too - especially the scrambled eggs which were perfectly done (little bit soft) and the meatball (was hint of wonderful cheese in it - Parmigiano-Reggiano or something similar?). Super yum. While I thought the pancake was great as well, the other 2 were the standouts for me.\n\nI also love the decor & ambiance of LM. I love how casual it is and how easy it is to feel comfortable with your family & friends. I think the ordering mechanics lend to that - you order at the counter & take your number to a table of your choice.\n\nThe building just reeks of character, with exposed brick and is beautifully decorated in kind of a retro vibe. The bathrooms are also very cool.\n\nIn past visits we've also had the meatballs, the rancher sandwich and some of the pizzas, which were all excellent.\n\nIf LM wasn't so far from our house, I know with certainty that it would be one of our regular haunts.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

Luckily one of the staff quickly handed us menus and told us where to order. \n\nI had a couple of caramel iced lattes and the Liberty Bowl. I loved both. The Liberty Bowl came with 4 big meatballs in marinara sauce and and two slices of toasted bread. It was so hard narrowing down my choice because there were so many delicious looking items on the menu and the baked goods display kept calling my name, but I resisted. Next time I think I'll just give in and have a slice of red velvet or carrot cake, or a cup cake or a slice of zucchini bread or a sticky bun. So much to choose from. I would love to come back here and have a coffee and sit and enjoy the atmosphere at the espresso bar. \n\nLoved all the different themes in the bathroom stalls. You have to check each one out.

One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. The Sicilian scramble is a favorite--though the smashed meatball was great. We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger. It should not be surprising that is was fantastic. Atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great--just go!", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

I was not as thrilled to try this place because I thought it was going to be yet another typical breakfast place just like all the rest.  I just hate going out to battle the Sunday breakfast crowds just to have the same ole' omelet or other run-of-the-mill breakfast item that tastes the same as every other place.\n\nI convinced myself that the parking situation was going to be a complete clusterfuq like it is at just about any other trendy breakfast spot in Scottsdale, but it was quite the opposite.  There is ample free parking and we found a spot without hassle.  I was surprised to see that the area actually wants people there instead of making it a complete pain to visit like some areas up north.  It just pisses me off when the idiots of Scottsdale rope off 100 more parking spots then they need and use it for valet parking.  Ok, my rant is over.\n\nAnyway, upon arrival at the Liberty Market there was a giant line and the place was real busy.  I expected this but was a bit pissed.  Luckily our friends saved us a place in line so it wasn't that bad.  I would advise coming as early as possible to avoid any crowds.  We ordered our food, took our seats and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food.  A bit long but it was expected because of how busy it was.\n\nTheir breakfast menu is not huge and had the staples as well as some unique items on it.  I ordered the Western Scramble and it was excellent!  I love meaty and cheesy when it comes to eggs and this was perfect.  I was a bit skeptical of the horseradish sauce that comes with it but I think it actually makes the meal.  It was an awesome combination.  My wife ordered the grilled vegetable scramble with egg whites and it was excellent as well.  We especially enjoyed the fresh biscuit and honey that came with our meals.  I also recommend the scone which our table shared.  The scones come with a side of fresh whip cream which was delightful.\n\nAnyway, I was a big fan of the breakfast and would definitely come back if I am in the area again come breakfast/brunch time.....or maybe even lunch time because their salads and sandwiches looked great!\n\nI am a big fan of that little stretch of Gilbert Road and there are a few other places along it I would like to try in the near future.  I can't wait to go to Joe's BBQ which is right across the street.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

I ordered the grilled sausage pizza made with the local Shriner's sausage. My dining companion ordered the Italia sandwich. We ordered at the counter and found the prefect table outside on the patio. The food took a few minuets to arrive, but it was fantastic. The pizza had a thin crust and very flavorful toppings. The sandwich was pressed and had an interesting sweet aftertaste we could not figure out. \nThe atmosphere was great and they obviously allow pets on the patio as there were a few dining with their owners. \nI will be back and I will be bringing my big goofy puppy!", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

The decor was inviting and it was all a buzz with customers. Seemed interesting enough. After moseying over to the mini market area to see several random things, including an all-in-one survival tool and a spoon with bendable arms and legs (this I bought!), I decided I needed some coffee. Stat. \n\nI put in my order for some Cuban espresso. Then I oogled and drooled over their pastry section. I was tempted to pick up a slice of carrot cake for my dad. It's his favorite. \n\nTime ticked by. And then, after 10 minutes, I was asked what I was waiting for. Coffee. Simple enough, right? Apparently I should have gone to the OTHER bar to order. The one with the espresso machines. But it was mad busy at the time, so I did what any college-educated java-drinker would do: I went to the first available associate. And she took my order. And my money. But she failed to let the other girl behind the OTHER bar know that I needed some caffeine. \n\nNot to fear, my order was taken care of, apologies were said more than once and I got a free cookie out of it. By the way, that truffle chocolate cookie was AMAZING. So was the Cuban espresso. \n\nDefinitely worth checking out. Hopefully they get that ordering glitch fixed soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}

Sorry, I started this review while still eating.  Ok, not really because nothing was going to tear me away from my meal.  \n\nI have never been let down by the food at Liberty Market, and when another place didn't work out, I dragged my friend here for her first visit.  \n\nThey were packed, but that didn't stop the staff from being super friendly and taking the time to answer all of our questions.  After securing a seat, it was only a short time before our meals were delivered and the nom nom nom commenced.  I actually don't think we talked much during the meal at all, we were more interested in eating!\n\nI had a juicy Tower Burger while my friend got the Grilled Chicken Pasta.  We were both impressed with the serving size, but it wasn't obscene like some places - filling and just enough that we were full but not uncomfortable.\n\nI only wish I had room left for dessert.", "type": "review", "business_id": "L9UYbtAUOcfTgZFimehlXw"}
