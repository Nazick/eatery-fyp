Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.\n\nSo, we finally got the attention of a server who was not our server, Michael. She was kind enough to take my steak back to the kitchen. Michael, our server, finally shows up 10 minutes later with a half-hearted apology and to let me know that my steak was being prepared again. He does not offer to refill our drink glasses that have now been sitting empty for 20 minutes. The manager makes an appearance and brings me a strip steak that looks rare from the sight of it. He informs me that my steak is on him and apologizes. He goes away. I cut into my steak and it's, you guessed it, Pittsburgh Rare. I asked for medium rare. He returns and I tell him that the chef needs to go back to culinary school and learn how to prepare a steak. The manager apologizes again and asks me if I want to take this pathetic piece of beef home with me! Not only is it rare but it's a cheap cut of strip steak that is loaded with connective gristle. I said no thanks. He comped my husband's meal and we left. I never hope for people to lose their jobs but the cook and the server really need some serious retraining! I will never go back to this Applebee's again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "h3la53L9-OX_HlfeAySh0Q"}

It took a couple mins. before anyone even came to the window, and then I had to sit there for almost 10 mins before I got my food.  A drive thru is suppose a little quicker service of getting your food.  And the food was not worth the price I paid for it.  This is not the first time I've had this kind of service there.  The people working there also don't seem like they want to be there.  I don't know why I even tried going back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "KFJ1jBfFkRfyn3AoAUl3YQ"}

My fiance and I recently celebrated our anniversary at Canyon Cafe.  \n\nPro: The chips and salsa rock my world! The entree's are delicious! The staff is friendly and efficient.  The ambiance is quiet and relaxed.\n\nCon: The carnitas tacos are very greasy.\n\nCanyon Cafe exceeds our expectations every time.  You go for dinner but you stay for the chips and salsa.  The chip basket includes sweet potato, blue corn, wonton, and regular tortilla chips.  The salsa is roasted and heavenly.  \n\nRecommended: The bison burger, it is juicy and flavorful. The Verde Chicken enchiladas, love the sauce and chicken is tender.  The top shelf margarita, suggested to share but make sure to stir or the tequila will go straight to your head.\n\nCan't wait to go back.  It's our little secret place that we enjoy because it's quiet and we usually leave feeling quite euphoric.", "type": "review", "business_id": "e5kc0CQ4R-PCCDgb274gSg"}
