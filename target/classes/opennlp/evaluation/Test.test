Went here for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today. A big "A-OK". Nothing special, but it did the trick.  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  the chimichanga  <START:Food> lunch <END>  special w/shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and the typical  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  on the side. For 6.99, no complaints other than the chimichanga was not fried. Came out as a  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> ...hmmm? Probably for the best anyway.  <START:Service> service <END>  was a little slow, as we sat  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  on the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  and were forgotten about once. Will I return...sure; if someone says "hey, I'm at Salsas come meet me" Will I seek  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  out for a  <START:Food> meal <END>  other than that...no. However; it's a decent  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for a Mexican  <START:Food> lunch <END> .

I eat  <START:Food> lunch <END>  here pretty frequently, and the  <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent.  Highly recommend the stuffed tomatoes. All the stir-fry type dishes that I have had have been excellent. And the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are extremely reasonable.  When they get crowded (pretty rare for  <START:Food> lunch <END> ) or have a big take out  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> , the  <START:W_Waiting> wait <END>  can be long as I don't think they have much in the way of kitchen  <START:S_Staff> staff <END> . OK, yes, the whole "Supreme Master" thing is quite strange, but honestly it sort of fades into the background anyway. And yes, the name looks a bit odd on an expense report if you take clients  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Still, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is great.

El Bravo has a typical  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  with the  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  items you expect to find at a Mexican  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> .  The success of El Bravo is the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END>  and their ability to put a distinct mark on Mexican standards.  I ordered the #6:  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  Tamale Deluxe Combo that included a shredded beef flauta, ground beef taco (with  <START:F_FoodItem> flour <END>  shell),  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tamale with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END> .  The flauta and tamale were fantastic.  The green sauce on the tamale top notch.  The flower taco shell was an interesting  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> .  It's the first I've had in the style offered at El Bravo.  I prefer the standard corn shell (also offered at El Bravo) but it made for a nice deviation from my typical taco  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . My  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  took longer than I would typically expect but  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the  <START:W_Waiting> wait <END> .  El Bravo has a smaller  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  and all the  <START:Food> food <END>  is prepared fresh when you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  This isn't assembly line style cooking.  You can even look into the kitchen from the counter and watch the magic happen.  The  <START:A_Plc_DiningRoom> dining area <END>  is of ample size and fit for the solo  <START:Restaurant> diner <END>  or families.  The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is clean and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is friendly and attentive.  Overall, I can say that El Bravo is one of the best  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , Mexican or otherwise, in Phoenix.

I love coming to Aloha on my  <START:Food> lunch <END>  break! The  <START:Food> food <END>  is excellent I love the combo with the katsu  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and teryiaki  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> . Its big enough that I can take some leftovers to my 3 year old who also loves  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ! Its fast, good cheap and  <START:Service> service <END>  is good!

One of the best, if not the best  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  in East Valley.  <START:Service> service <END>  was excellent.  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> -owned business and able to answer all questions.  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  and  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  were high-end but comfortable,  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  couldn't have been better.  <START:Offers> happy hour <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  could use some more items, however that's not why we choose to eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Love, love, loved Chirashi  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  bowl. Special strawberry custard  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was amazing! Definitely adding to my favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> , can't  <START:W_Waiting> wait <END>  to go back.

Great  <START:Food> food <END>  and they have deep fried rattle snake yum.

When I need a quick lift and a satisfying  <START:Food> meal <END> ...Chili's has my business.  Our Chili's is full of good  <START:Food> food <END> , good  <START:Service> service <END>  and a pulse that says  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's life between the  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  of the establishment.  The Chili's  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  are always friendly and efficient and the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has lots of options for a variety of  <START:F_Appetizer> appetites <END> .  It's just a nice, comfortable  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to replenish my energy bank!

Best tamales,  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  ever!! Also love their  <START:F_FoodItem> enchiladas <END> ,Chile rellenos-enchilada style, and  <START:F_FoodItem> tacos <END> :)

Beautiful  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  Very slow  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:Service> service <END> .   <START:Food> food <END>  was nothing to write home about.  The most troubling part was the  <START:O_Payment> billing <END> .  Two  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  in our group  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  using the same company's credit card.  When I checked my credit card account on line the following day, I was charged for 2 meals which actually should have been charged to another person.  Corresponding with the other card holder, I found out he was not charged for any meals. In addition, I was charged for an item I never ordered or received.

For a while they were known as the go to  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for Chinese BBQ. Now I wonder how they stay in business. With crooked practices, you have to watch them carefully.On a few occasions, my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  and I have been cheated by them. They have calculated our  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  wrong. Then  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are the times that they have taken a duck leg when we ordered a whole bird to take home. A one legged duck is not a common sight, so I do not know how they thought they could get away with it. My dad did not let this slide and raised hell. They of course apologized, but the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  another part was missing. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is nothing special compared to the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  they charge. Go upstairs to Capital  <START:Food> seafood <END>  or go down the street to  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Noodle. If you like Chinese BBQ go to the take out  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  connected to the International Marketplace. They are a fraction of the  <START:W_Price> price <END>  and do not try to pull the wool over their customers.

Terrible  <START:Service> service <END> ,   <START:F_FoodItem> wings <END>  are not good and the  <START:S_Staff> girls <END>  aren't even that hot. Would highly recommend not coming here. I personally will never come back

I am not normally a huge fan of Denny's but, they gave me FREE  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  YESTERDAY!

As far as Madison's Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  scene,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is pretty good. The  <START:F_FoodItem> salsa <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END>  were unremarkable but the Anasazi  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  I ordered was tasty (certainly a step up from the La Bambas and Taco Bells of the world). My main complaint would be the  <START:W_Price> price <END> , which was a little excessive. They have more options than a chipotle, but the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  was fairly similar to Chipotle  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , except that it  <START:F_FI_Price> cost <END>  basically two dollars more. I'm not sure the extra  <START:W_Price> money <END>  is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it if you're just going to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a dry  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END> .

Yum. Love Schlotzskys.  This  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  was good.  Clean, quiet, and prompt  <START:Service> service <END> .  No complaints.

Wish I could leave no stars waited 25 minutes for  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  Cindy to take our orders. Never happened? She Helped everyone beside our  <START:A_Furniture> table <END> . Rude  <START:Service> service <END>  never returning.

It's the only possible explanation for  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> .Why would anyone spend ten minutes looking for a  <START:S_Parking> parking <END>  spot a half mile away, stand in line for forty-five minutes among a gaggle of droopy-eyed young  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  whose faces are wearing the previous night's story, only to have the effort rewarded with extremely slow  <START:Service> service <END>  and mediocre  <START:Food> food <END> ?I think it's called "misery loves company."Well I'm pretty miserable most mornings, but I don't feel the need to make my miserable worse by standing in a line gawking at others equally as miserable, eating  <START:Food> food <END>  that's miserable, and becoming even more miserable after my  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , who I think may be related to David Copperfield, mysteriously vanishes, only to reappear with a smile and a check. Here's a tip  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  Club. Hangovers require water.Lots and lots of water.

I love Cheba Hut and always will. So many good toasted sandwiches... My favorites are the Spicy Widow (White Widow with the Jamaican Red  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END> ), Afghani and The Kind, but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are so many more to choose from!Something about the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  or the toasting... these sandwiches are so damn delicious.

Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to enjoy your afternoon after work. I used to go all the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  then they changed the calamari from giant legit ones to tiny pieces of breading so I stopped going. I probably won't go back till they change that back. Other than that, the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  has great  <START:Food> food <END> !

I just went to Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine.And I must say that I haven't ate Dim Sum in 6 months since I came to America as an exchange student. And I LOVE the  <START:Food> food <END> .I feel like I'm back home in Hong Kong when I'm in this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . The  <START:Service> service <END>  is good and fast like in Hong Kong.So it's definitely a 5 Star  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> 

Ellis is a true locals favorite. They make their own craft  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>   <START:W_Price> priced <END>  at $2 for 20 ounces or half  <START:W_Price> price <END>  during football. They offer the best barbecue in town s d at the best  <START:W_Price> price <END>  in town. Love the Karaoke  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  open 7 days a week with KJ Charlie and KJ Lucy. You never know who will show up. Always a great spot did a great  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> .

La Playita is fantastic!  The  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  can't be beat.  If you like Mexican  <START:Food> seafood <END>  dishes, this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to be in Vegas!

Amazing customer  <START:Service> service <END> .  I got the teriyaki  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  w/ <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>   <START:Food> lunch <END>  special.  They had it ready for me to pickup in 15 minutes.  It was great and high  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> .  I'll definitely be returning.

 <START:Service> service <END> , fantastic.  WE LOVE JULIA! <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  - great.  i had a classic american, not dry, not greasy, a good mixbar - by far the winning move here is the  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  selection.  they have everything.  high end, low end, european, local, etc.  I had boddingtons on tap 1 visit.  the other visits were chimay.

really good  <START:Food> food <END>  at a reasonable  <START:W_Price> pricethe <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  and corn  <START:F_FoodItem> muffins <END>  with  <START:F_FoodItem> butter <END>  were a great start to the mealordered sophie's chopped  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . had  <START:F_FoodItem> beans <END>  and a tasty dressingthe only vegetarian entree was the chili rellenowas crusted in  <START:F_FoodItem> cornmeal <END>  and you can  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  all the spices that went into it including ground corianderthe fresh corn tamale was soso. nothing specialthe sticky  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pudding <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> coconut <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END>  were both very very goodall in all a great  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> !

Here's the deal- As far as  <START:Food> food <END>  goes,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  deserves 5 stars, its inventive, fresh, Mexican  <START:Food> food <END>  and always amazing. The  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  is great and I would love to frequent it. However, the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  Azucena Tovar always comes off as a little ambivalent about her clientel, and I just can't get over it. We eat out a lot. My expectation and hope is an evening with great company,  <START:Food> food <END> , and  <START:Service> service <END> . Great company I can handle, great  <START:Food> food <END>  Los Sombreros has covered...but the  <START:Service> service <END>  makes me wince. The  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  is the first person to greet you at the door and she is abrasive and has been rude (kinda sets the tone, it's her  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  after all). Not once, not twice, but several times. I try and support businesses that value and appreciate their clients, especially in this financial climate. So my compromise is take-out. We only (rarely)  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  take-out and on the condition my husband picks it up so I dont have to be reminded why we no longer eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . Christmas tamales are to die for.

You need to be drunk to enjoy  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> . The  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  should consider covering up their cleaveges as with an average age of above 40 it doesn't look too attractive. The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is dark and their loud  <START:A_Ent_LiveShow> band <END>  was annoying in my subjective opinion. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is mediocre at best and definitely is NOT good value for  <START:W_Price> money <END>  for Las Vegas. It should be twice cheaper to be somewhat competive. I am not coming back and won't recommend it to anyone.

The first thing we started to notice was just how slow these  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  were.  Even when we explained to the  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  that things seemed like they are taking a long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  it didn't get much better.  This is nothing more than an over- <START:W_Price> priced <END>   <START:Food> seafood <END>  joint.  I had the scallops which amounted to what looked like 3 half-dollar scallops in some sort of sauce that was sour.  Three  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  later and your  <START:Food> meal <END>  is gone.  Overall the  <START:Food> portions <END>  were very small and I actually left hungry even after having  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END> .   <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is all flash and no punch.  Go elsewhere.

Whenever my extended  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  stays at the Wynn (more than I'd like to admit...), we always enjoy a  <START:Food> meal <END>  at Red 8. The Asian  <START:Food> food <END>  here is really yummy and it's fun to look out the "window" into the Wynn casino.Last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , I enjoyed one of the most delicious  <START:F_FoodItem> cocktails <END>  I'd ever  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END> . I ordered fresh watermelon juice with vodka and it was SO good!!! I always fill up on the  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> -style Asian  <START:Food> food <END>  too and then head into the Casino to work off the  <START:Food> food <END>  ;)Red 8 is accommodating for young children and not as expensive as one would expect of a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  in the Wynn.

Red 8 is an amazing authentic Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  with great  <START:Ambience> ambiance <END> . My husband and I stay at the Wynn 2-3 times per year and always have a  <START:Food> meal <END>  at Red 8 when we are in town. Great  <START:Service> service <END> , extensive  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> , late hours...I would recommend you check it out!

Great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat! The only thing that keeps this a four star review is that our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  is never around. We were seated at the  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  (nice outdoor area overlooking the entrance of the mall) and after putting down our menus he didn't return. Eventually one of the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  took our  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  for us. Our  <START:Food> food <END>  eventually came but we were not given any utensils, and our water was not refilled throughout our  <START:Food> meal <END> . That aside, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is very delicious and reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END> . I love their  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  and they have cheap  <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  options or nicer  <START:Food> seafood <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> pasta <END>  options. I'm a big fan of  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  so the I love the  <START:Food> meal <END>  here. Arguably better than the buffet options on the strip which costs too much!

 <START:Food> lunch <END>  buffet...poor tasting  <START:Food> food <END> .. they tried to cover the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  w spiciness.. would not recommend

I should know better than to go to a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with bad Yelp reviews.  Lesson learned.  I thought that a  <START:Restaurant> diner <END>  couldn't mess up a basic  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>   <START:Food> breakfast <END> , but they did.   <START:Service> service <END>  was slow to nonexistent, while  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  that worked  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  stood around and talked to each other.  Poached eggs came with the yolk broken and running in the poaching water.  I had to explain to my  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  for 5 minutes why I needed new eggs.  How do you mess up poached eggs?!?  And why would you serve me poached eggs with the yolk running all over?!?  Ah!!!  FML!  Even the bacon and hash browns weren't good.  Heed my warning - don't do it.  I took the bullet so you don't have to.

I thought it was good not outstanding and not bad...the steak was done to a perfect med rare and my wife's was done to her liking... We both in joyed it but it was a little  <START:W_Price> pricey <END> ...

WHOA! HOW DO I FINISH THIS  <START:Food> food <END> ????  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is absolutely no way any one human being can finish an entire plate of  <START:Food> food <END>  from  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ! I ordered the swiss and  <START:F_FoodItem> mushroom <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  and it lasted me for three meals. THREE! I ate it for  <START:Food> lunch <END> , leftovers for  <START:Food> dinner <END> , and then leftovers AGAIN for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  today! The  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are very reasonable for such mountainous  <START:Food> portions <END> . I am nervous to return now learning about this insanity. We came on a whim and we will be returning. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was absolutely sweet and very attentive to our needs. I have heard some complaints about the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  from friends after telling them where we had  <START:Food> lunch <END> , however we didn't have any problems. My  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was juicy and well  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> mushrooms <END>  and swiss did not disappoint. The  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  was quite soft and fluffy. I am commenting on the  <START:F_FoodItem> bun <END>  because I usually toss those to the side as I devour the real  <START:Food> meal <END> . A lot of  <START:Restaurant> place <END> 's buns can be quite dry or plain. I can't  <START:W_Waiting> wait <END>  to return and hopefully be blown away again! I will definitely be splitting my plate with a friend next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> !

I'm sure Arizona  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  Company is a great  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to stop and have a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  with your friends,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is plenty of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END> 's to watch in addition to do some off track betting. I didn't know this was a sports  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  never mind that it had off track betting. The last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I was here (many years ago) it was a  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Families were  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  with kids so I was suprised to see it had changed. That being said we didn't go  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for the noisy  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> , to watch sports on  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>  or off track betting we  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  to have a late  <START:Food> lunch <END>  and we wanted  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Since we were already  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and didn't want to go looking for anoother  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to eat, we stayed. Each of us (my wife- Carol, our friend Kathy R. and me) all ordered a personal  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . Kathy R. & my wife ordered a pepperoni & sausage personal  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> . I ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  lovers  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  (pepperoni, sauage, &  <START:F_FoodItem> meatball <END> ) Kathy & I also got a side  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> . It seems I must be a lot more picky than my wife and Kathy. They both enjoyed their  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and said it was very good. Now the last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I had a wood fired  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  it was at the Colorado Belle (Laughlin, NV ) in The Boiler pub and it was   Absolutely delicious!! so I was excited to try the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  here because they advertised wood fired pizzas. My  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  crust was thin and crispy with some burnt edges, it looked great.  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  right?  WRONG, I left feeling like I could have done better elsewhere. <START:Food> food <END> : The  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was NOT that impressive. Overall the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  lacked  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . It was rather bland. A real disappointment considering it was wood fired  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> .  <START:W_Price> price <END> : Decently  <START:W_Price> priced <END> . You will not find these  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  for the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  anywhere.  <START:Service> service <END> : The  <START:Service> service <END>  was okay. Our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  was nice and attentive but she did not introduce herself, .  CONCLUSION:  The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is not well suited for families. It is a noisy sports  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  with off track betting.  I wasn't that impressed.

It was good.But the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was very limited, and while I can appreciate a small  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ... this one just didn't have much that I was interested in.So I ended up ordering the bacon  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , which was delicious... but.  It's just not my cup o  <START:F_Drinks> tea <END> .I looked over the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ... then looked over it some more.... and it was one of the first times I thought "meh" ....Usually at a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  I want to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  like 5 different things because I get so excited.So I was pretty disappointed that I didn't see one thing that I thought sounded exciting.I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, no no.

They have an amazing  <START:Offers> happy hour <END> .  Try the grown up peach  <START:F_Drinks> iced   tea   <END> , a baguette, and the  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  bowl (with our without  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END> ).  Love the building they transformed as well!

Always a fan of this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  chain and will continue as a customer. Went to this  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  at 9:40pm on Jan 3rd for a  <START:F_FoodItem>   chicken     salad   <END>  and I guess the  <START:S_Staff> cashier <END> , Jessica wasn't too pleased to have customers so close to closing. Very unpleasant  <START:S_Stf_Appearance> personality <END> , ... even when we tried being overly friendly ... but  <START:S_Staff> everyone else <END>  was very nice.  <START:Food> food <END>  was great as usual.

Hooray for Envy!We hit Envy after a long day of many pineapple mojitos & shots, and no  <START:Food> food <END>  at the pool. Generally this combo would put me straight to bed, but on this particular night I rallied, and thank goodness I did!With the four of us piled into a 1998 Camry (only the classiest while staying at the Wynn) we rolled up to the Envy for what is has become one of the more memorable dinners I've done in recent times. We started with the chilled  <START:Food> seafood <END>  platter for 2 - try for 6. We had a tough  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  finishing this but somehow we managed.  Somewhere  <START:A_Environment> in   there   <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with some goat  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was passed around. So rich, it should have been  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> . My husband and I shared the bone-in filet while our partners in crime both had petite filets. The bone-in was ah-ma-zing. Juicy, perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END> ... I am drooling thinking about it. The creamed corn was a perfect side for this  <START:Food> meal <END> . We did wine, we did  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> , and we did espresso. We also did a $75  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END> .com  <START:S_Gift> gift <END>  certificate and I made it through the  <START:Food> meal <END>  without passing out. Winner-Winner-Winner!

We dropped in here last Saturday with high expectations after the rave reviews of friends. Being both big  <START:Food> seafood <END>  fans and also believers in  <START:Food> food <END> -as-sport, we thought we'd found our  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  utopia.Boy, were we wrong.The  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  was bland, the sauce was not spicy, and the sides that we ordered never came. Either we came at an off  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> , or  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is WAAAAAAAAAY over-hyped.

 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is decent, but nothing to rave about.  I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that comments on the poor  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  in North Las Vegas.  How you can give  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  anything over 4 stars is just beyond silly.  The great thing about  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is that it fills a niche that is totally unfilled in the area.  The  <START:Food> food <END>  is generally decent, even if a little over  <START:W_Price> priced <END> .  The  <START:Food> portions <END>  are generous depending on what you get.  Be sure to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  extra tzatziki sauce for your gyro, as they are very stingy with it here.  The most disappointing part of  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> .  From the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> , it looked like a very nice, perhaps even romantic  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> , akin to Macaroni Grill or even the Olive Garden.  The minute I walked in, all of those expectations were crushed.  The  <START:A_Environment> environment <END>  is much more laid back and cheap than what it seems from the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END> . It has an almost fast  <START:Food> food <END>  feel.  The best thing that I can compare it to is Fazoli's Italian fast  <START:Food> food <END>  chain for those of you that have been  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . At any rate, it's a decent  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , but certainly not anything above average.

I came here for the first  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  earlier tonight after a long day of rehearsals.  (Yeah, it's taken me *this* long to check  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  out!)  I was sober and very hungry and thus, enjoyed my Hawaiian  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  very very much.  I thought that: 1)  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was a lot of ham and  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  in my sandwich2) the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  had that 'just baked' feel - crispy/crunchy on the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and soft on the inside3) the sauce was tangy and oh-so-good!I felt like I ate a Hawaiian  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> !  YUM.  I also thought my accompanying chocolate chip  <START:F_FoodItem> cookie <END>  was delicious.  (I bought a country apple  <START:F_FoodItem> muffin <END>  for my hubby and he *just* devoured it, pronouncing the  <START:F_FoodItem> muffin <END>  as "hey, that was really good!.")One of the more affordable options on the Strip and dang, why is  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  only one  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  in Vegas, let alone NV?  If you're ever around Planet Hollywood and want a cheapish bite, visit EoS!

We went here one afternoon about two weeks ago for  <START:Food> lunch <END> . We ordered the thin crust  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , half  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  half pepperoni and a white  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  as well. They were both AWESOME!!! The  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  was the kind that just stretches off the slice. The  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  of the sauce and crust was Terrific! Sauce had a wonderful texture and  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> . The white  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  was light and fresh  <START:F_FoodItem> spinach <END>  with artichoke and drizzled with olive oil and  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> . Oh and how could I forget to mention the ravioli  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> ? OMG! Soooo good!     WE ORDERD TAKE OUT FROM HERE A FEW DAYS AGO.  It was piping HOT when my husband got it home! Still just as good as eating in. Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was great. Never an empty glass. The  <START:S_Staff> manager <END> / <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  was very nice too. We will definitely tell our friends that come to town about  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ! Can't  <START:W_Waiting> wait <END>  to go back!

The best thing about  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is the  <START:Service> service <END> . When I came here with my  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END> ,  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were like, five  <START:S_Staff> waiters <END>  orbiting our  <START:A_Furniture> table <END>  at all times--but in a (skillfully) unobtrusive way. The  <START:Food> food <END>  is not outstanding, but it's solid. They bring out a basket of raw vegetables before the entrees, which may sound like no big deal, but the fresh veggies  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  sooo good after a couple days of Vegas buffets.The problem with  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is...well...it's sorta stinky. We sat in this cute little cove by a window, and the entire  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  the stale, faint aroma of ASS lingered in the  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END> . What's worse, the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathrooms <END>  (literally) smelled like shit. They have a hold-your-breath-or-you-will-ingest-poop-particles  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> bathroom <END> . A pity.

After only two trips  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  has won my first five star review as a yelper.  My first trip I was trying to keep it healthy and I built my own  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  with a perfectly  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  Buffalo  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  on top.  This was a first for me and I highly recomend it for anyone out their who knows they should  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> (you are at a freakin  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END> ) but you just cannot afford the carbs.My second trip I gave in and ordered the Mama Ricotta's  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>   <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  medium on wheat(highly touted by my roommate).  This  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  comes with fresh mottzerella,  <START:F_FoodItem> tomato <END> , and housemade pesto   and is quite possibly the best  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  I have ever had.  I also had the special side of the day which was their Mac-n- <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  with a spoonful of chilli on top.  I was only able to eat three  <START:F_Appetizer> bites <END>  of the side but I knew it was something I could enjoy later.If you want the best and greasiest buger you have ever had, it can be found here!

 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is a VAST distance from my house. Fortunately, I was in the area on business, met the wife and went here for  <START:Food> lunch <END>  based on the positive Yelp reviews and the fact that she'd been here before and really liked it. GOD I'm glad I did. The first thing that hit me was the  <START:A_Environment> smell <END>  as we walked in - amazing. I've been to a lot of Indian buffets; this one SMELLED the best. So far, so good. Found our  <START:A_Furniture> table <END>  but as usual with any given buffet, arse didn't hit the chair before I was schlopping  <START:Food> food <END>  onto my plate. Dhal, channa,  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  curry, aloo gobhi,  <START:F_FoodItem>   chicken   tikka masala <END>  (out when I was at the buffet, but they filled it up pretty quick after),  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and pea samosas,  <START:F_FoodItem> potato <END>  pakoras, and a giant laundry-basket-sized  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  cooker to scoop from. Flung a few ribbons of raita Jackson Pollock-like (or Ron Jeremy-like, depending on your aesthetic sensibilities) across the heaped plate and back to the  <START:A_Furniture> table <END>  to dine. Out came some  <START:F_FoodItem> garlic <END>  naan (better than  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  naan!) which was thin and fresh. Making good on the promise of the initial  <START:A_Environment> smell <END> , the  <START:Food> food <END>  was VERY flavorful. Best buffet I've been to. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  curry was actually SPICY, not dumbed down. Why the hell does  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  have to be ~40 miles from my house? One thing's for sure, I'll be back. Maybe not for a while, but still - Indian Paradise rocketed to #1 on my Indian  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  list after the first mouthful and I'm pretty sure the same will be the case for any Indian  <START:Food> food <END>  aficionado that tries it. Word of warning - it may be too much of a punch in the mouth for newcomers to the cuisine - if that's you, I suggest getting your feet wet at Bombay Spice (Tatum and Shea) first before trying this joint. Came out with my gut looking like an alien was going to bust out of it and my tastebuds feeling as though they'd gone around the LHC a few billion times. Hands down five out of five.

Hi Guys !!  I thought I was the only one putting a 1 Star on this joint, not Reataurant I said Joint .... well, the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  well it was uhmm , not that good.. the  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END>  it was ok but the rest I don't know how to say it but not that Good . It's a  <START:F_Dessert> desert <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>  Japanese kinda  <START:Food> food <END> . One of the  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END>  I guess she stands to greet the  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  coming in. I was like what even my wife said what the !! That lady has a see through blouse and no bra !!! I was, are we in the right  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  ??? Is this a Retaurant or a Strip joint ?? very wierd ....  this is what we saw ... we really had second thought's of not coming back!   <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  should be Ichi Banned  !!

Ever since St. Patty's weekend, I've started waking up early to grab brunch. At first, it was more to fill up my stomach after a heavy night of drinking, but lately, it's become more of a goal to try out more brunch places.Because Madison has such amazing brunch, it's really hard for me to crown a favorite. However, if I were to ever pick a favorite, I might have to go with Bradbury's.Bradbury's is a cozy little joint right off of the corner of the Capitol on N. Hamilton St.The  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  is small, so  <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  can get crowded. Sharing  <START:A_Furniture> tables <END>  with other  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  is encouraged, and you can meet some really awesome  <START:S_Staff> people <END> , like a hungover me :pAnyways, I got a cup of pourover  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  and their nutella banana almond  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> . I went with their medium roast, which immediately warmed (and woke) me up on a cold morning. The  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  was brewed perfectly, and the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  was smooth and earthy. I was enjoying my  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  so much that I almost completely forgot about my  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END> .Good thing my stomach reminded me, and I started digging into my  <START:Food> meal <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  was folded over itself beautifully, with nutella spread out artfully on top. It was accompanied by a dollop of whip cream and bits of powdered  <START:F_Ingredients> sugar <END> . The first bite of the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  might have been one of the happiest moments of my life. Having been to France and having sampled countless of crepes, I could confidently say Bradbury's makes some of the best crepes out  <START:Restaurant> there <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  was soft and thin, which most crepes should be, but still firm enough to hold all of its fruits without falling apart, which most crepes fail at. The warmed up pieces of banana clung to the  <START:F_FoodItem> crepe <END>  like honey, and really meshed well with the texture and  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  wasn't too much nutella, which most of the  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  would be a bad thing, but in this case, kept the  <START:Food> meal <END>  light and fluffy. Speaking of fluffy, the whip cream was definitely the icing on the  <START:F_FoodItem> cake <END> , providing that extra level of sweetness.

 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  while quiet... was loud! Loud with  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , Jason.. was THE cutest thing evah! He was so extremely helpful with all of our questions. We had  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END> , sashimi, deeelish black  <START:F_FoodItem> pepper <END>  edamame. A "tad" spendy, but I would eat  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again and again. For the  <START:Food> food <END>  and the  <START:Service> service <END> ! Thanks!!

Why was I charged $12 for a bowl of  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  at  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  even if  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is it 1 dollar sign for affordability? It was great  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END> ,  but I haven't back since.

Amazing  <START:Service> service <END> !  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is so nice and very friendly. Attentive as well. My brother was in town for the day and was looking for a bit of Asiain flare and I had remembered going to  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  one  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  before based on the reviews. My brother had the Veggie Curry and loved every bite of it. It had great  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END>  and the veggies were not mushy like they can get in some not so good curries. I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  pho, add a bit of hots and was good to go. We also had 2 apps, the veggie  <START:F_FoodItem>   spring     rolls   <END>  and the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  satay. The satay was a bit over done, but the  <START:S_Staff> owner <END>  popped by the  <START:A_Furniture> table <END>  to tell us that and that she would take that off of the  <START:O_Payment> bill <END>  without us even saying anything. I will be dining here again!

Love  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> . Awesome  <START:Service> service <END> !   <START:Food> food <END>  is amazing. Employees are awesome. Every birthday or event I always come here. The  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  has such a wide variety. They offer a  <START:S_Gift> rewards <END>  program and you can call ahead and tell them you will be  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  soon and they will hold a  <START:A_Furniture> table <END> . Also I come here for the pazooki :)

LOVE the shawarma here.  <START:Food> food <END>  is great.  <START:Food> lunch <END>  times are always busy - but the line moves fast enough that you can't get too upset. Great for on the go  <START:Food> lunches <END>  when you need to get back to the office.

Not quite the original, but almost.  As the name suggests, the original Dilallo  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  was started by Papa Luigi Dilalo back in 1929, but it didn't get started in this exact  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END> .  They had to move down the block in 1967 to make way for the Metro.  So the structure is 1960s vintage, and the  <START:A_Decor> interior <END>  is 1980s vintage.  Still, this is one of Montreal's great shrines.  Dilallo isn't the only Montreal establishment that's festooned its  <START:A_Decor> walls <END>  with tributes to the Habs and the Als, but how many places can you name that also celebrate Mario "Le Magnifique" Lemieux and Maurice "Mad Dog" Vachon, as well as Hank "Tony Angelo" Pardi and the infamous 1973-4 Ville-Émard Pussycats?  And they've been making one of Montreal's wickedest  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  for over 80 years now.  My favorite is the Buck  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , with capicolla and hot  <START:F_FoodItem> peppers <END> .  The  <START:W_Price> price <END>  has gone up a little since they first named it, but it's still just as unique as ever.

I really wanted to like  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  Monte...some of my friends just rave about it.  On a recent trip for Saturday brunch, however, my omelet my was nothing short of tasteless.  My friend wasn't impressed with her  <START:Food> meal <END>  either.  I may try it again, but only not for brunch.

If  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  is what you like, then this is the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . We had  <START:O_Reservation> reservations <END>  and were promptly seated when we arrived. The side are buffet style and very good. They had  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  walking around with large skewers of  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  that stopped at your  <START:A_Furniture> table <END>  whenever you had the green button face up. All of the  <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  were excellent. The  <START:Service> service <END>  was great.

Montpeiliers is ... fine.  It's A-OK.  It doesn't have any specific charm, it  serves edible  <START:Food> food <END> , it has reasonably standard  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> , and it's a bit over  <START:W_Price> priced <END> .  But, it's near where I work, and it serves  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .  Every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I come here I wonder, do the clientele just come here because it's convenient?  Because it has  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>   <START:S_Seating> seating <END>  and heat lamps?  Quite possibly.  That's certainly why I frequent it.  It just feels so soulless.  It surely must be part of a chain because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is absolutely nothing unique about it.  But, at the end of the day, you know you will get a reasonable  <START:Food> meal <END> , a reasonable  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END> , with reasonable  <START:Service> service <END> , and the  <START:A_Plc_Bathroom> toilets <END>  will be clean.  A-OK.

About a year ago, I saw  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  advertised in a paper.  Went  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  and it scared us off.  Fast forward today, and were very pleased.  While no  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  whatsoever, the  <START:Food> food <END>  is made fresh.  My hubby loved the chana masala and I dug the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tandoori.  We ordered some naan and it came fresh out of their oven.   <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  rivels our fave Pakistani  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  in San Francisco!  We'll definitely go again.

I love the  <START:Food> food <END>  at Café Rio. It's always consistent and the same as every single  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . I had every one of their daily  <START:Food> specials <END>  and they're all delicious. Just one concern with the Centennial  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  they're not always on top of their to go orders. So if you get to go make sure you check to see that every single thing you ordered is right

Peer Off The Pier My DearBy The RueSatruday night stopped at Pier Fifty Four, This is a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  I'd never been before, The second I pulled up I knew I had scored,Live acoustic  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  didn't bore,I'm going to come by here a lot more,Really was hoping to check out some slores,I guess this night it just wasn't in store,I wonder if it's because I'm poor,My friends wife calls me a male whore,Even though all the stories are just folk lore,After hiking Usery Mountain my legs were sore, <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  sits on the lake shore,I like to mine for gold not ore,I cut some serious rug on the dance floor,Not as good looking as the God Thor,My kiss will rock you to your core,I'll steal your underwear from your drawer,After the 3rd orgasm you'll yell "FORE"!Back Door!!

 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is great !I ordered the  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> seared <END>  ahi  <START:F_FoodItem>   tuna     salad   <END>  and when it came the neighboring  <START:A_Furniture> table <END>  was drooling.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  was  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> seared <END>  perfectly, topped w/  <START:F_FoodItem>   sesame   seeds <END>  and was so fresh !  I also had a tip from a good buddy of mine to try the frozen hot chocolate  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END> .  Got the large cup and split it w/ my homeboy.Heads up - its $14 and good, but way too sweet for my  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END> .  I like my sweets but good lord , you have to be a super sweet tooth to really enjoy the frozen hot chocolate  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  ~  I definitely will come back here the next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  I am in Vegas, but pass on  <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  ^_^.

I absolutely LOVE indian  <START:Food> food <END> . Majority of the  <START:Food> food <END>  was spicy - but SOO good.  <START:F_FoodItem> butter <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  is always a good one though. Plating size is very  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it - I can never finish all the  <START:Food> food <END> . Somosa's - yum! I believe I  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  $11 - very good  <START:W_Price> price <END>  for what I had. This is more of a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for quick eating. It's  <START:A_Decor> decor <END>  is not fantastic and the organization of  <START:A_Furniture> tables <END>  is a little messy. But I'm here for  <START:Food> food <END>  - so I don't really mind.

The Three Sisters is a large pub situated on the end of the Cowgate which can accommodate a variety of social functions.  I has an upstairs room in which live  <START:A_Ent_Music> music <END>  and  <START:A_Entertainment> comedy shows <END>  are held, a small dance-floor downstairs and a  <START:A_Places> courtyard <END>  which acts as a smoking area as well as a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  garden in summer.  Further,  <START:A_Ent_Tv> large screens <END>  are used for showing big sporting events which usually attract large crowds.  Depending on what one wants out of a Saturday night out The Three Sisters may or may not be the ideal venue to begin or spend it in.  It is often used as the site of Stag and Hen parties and, therefore, if your looking for a quiet  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>  and catchup with your friends this probably isn't the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> .  On the other hand, if your feeling young and wild this is an ideal  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  to start the night as its lively,  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  are reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  is sufficient for coping with the numbers who flock to its bars on Friday and Saturday nights.  I've been to The Three Sisters several times and always enjoyed myself, however, the  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END>  isn't quite as bustling or friendly as I'd like it to be.

Was greeted and seated promptly.Didn't know dim sum was served here, so we were pleasantly surprised to see the dim sum on wheel carts while following the  <START:S_Staff> hostess <END>  to our  <START:A_Furniture> table <END> .  (Today is Sunday, so I am not sure if dim sum is available on just Sundays, on both Saturday and Sunday, or every day).The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very attentive and friendly.  The suggestions our  <START:S_Staff> waitress <END>  recommended were on point.  Well, except for the papaya  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> , which lacked the kick that most papaya salads have.  Barely  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  the  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  sauce or lime in it.   Loved the sea bass, the marinated fried squid.  If you're in the Aria and you're craving Asian / Thai'ish (yes, I said "ish")  <START:Food> food <END> , Lemongrass is definitely  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  checking out.  Pricing is also reasonable.  My party of 3 ate 4 selections of dim sum, sea bass, marinated fried squid, papaya  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> brown   rice   <END> , and we also drank 2 Thai teas and 1 fresh-cocunut juice for a total of $103 pre-tip.  More importantly, we were FULL AND SATISFIED.   <START:W_Price> worth <END>  coming back to try out more of what their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  offers.

New Years Eve fixed  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  was a complete failure. First course was frozen, literally. We sent a couple plates back only to receive the same ice cold  <START:Food> food <END> . The veal was inedible. It was so tough that it was impossible to cut with a  <START:S_Cutlery> knife <END> . We passed the plates around to all the guys as a challenge. It was the last course and most of us were done with the entire  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> . A couple of friends  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  extra for the sommelier wine flight only to find out later that he called in sick. The  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END> , as qualified as he may have been, picked the pairings.Our friends, who recommended the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> , apologized the entire night while swearing up and down that they usually receive great  <START:Food> food <END> . Unfortunately, I will never find out. What hurts the most is that the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  seemed completely uninterested in trying to make up for their failures. No comps; they charged us the full amount, including for some items we didn't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . While most of us (party of 8) felt a rumble in our stomachs after we left, only one guy was physically sick later on. I can think of 10 better ways to throw away $300.

Great!  Finally find one the whole  <START:A_Env_Type> family <END>  would like to go!Though it is a bit further away from the strip, it is  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  the extra 5-8 minutes drive

came her on saturday night around 9pm and the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  was not packed which is a define plus especially after working a full day at the phoenix comic con, the last thing i want to do is  <START:W_Waiting> wait <END>  for a  <START:A_Furniture> table <END> .  Got seated immediate by our  <START:S_Staff> server <END> , she was extremely nice and provided great recommendations.I ordered the el diablo  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , the nutella milk shake and the truffle  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  were good but a little soggy, not sure if it was the truffle oil that made it soggy.  Nutella milk shake had a good mix of chocolate, hazelnut and  <START:F_FoodItem> toffee <END>   <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> , only suggestion would be that they provide a bigger straw becuase the  <START:F_FoodItem> toffee <END>  bits clog up the thin straws.  Ordered my  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  medium, came out nice and hot and  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  perfectly.  Probably could have had a second  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  but didnt want to be a pig.

 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is like a McDonalds for adults, everything is just that little bit more grown up I guess is the best way to describe the  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . You can get your  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END>  with a  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END> . The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is from the West brewery rather than some standard fosters or tennants malarky, so thumbs up from me on that note.The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  is comfortable enough with some booths, high  <START:A_Furniture> tables <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>   <START:S_Seating> seating <END> . Nothing too complicated and from the asthetics its nice enough, but it is a  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  joint so on to the  <START:Food> food <END> ....I guess the bad bit first the Onion rings ewww!! These were swimming in grease and pretty much inedible. I definately would steer clear of these even after a few  <START:F_Drinks> beers <END>  I couldnt imagine them being appealing.Now one of my favourite items on the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  the cajun fires. The spice mix on these bad boys is amazing!! I dont even like  <START:F_FoodItem> chips <END> / <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> , but these are something else. The  <START:Food> portion <END>  size has decreased, but I actually  <START:A_OutsideView> view <END>  that as a good thing because I struggled to finish them last  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> . To accompany this I grabbed some of the  <START:F_FoodItem> slaw <END> . This stuff was great really fresh tasting and a great accompanyment to the  <START:F_FoodItem> fries <END> .The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  is served in a plastic glass which is fine I guess, but I would rather of had a proper glass. This point had me hovering between 3 and a 4 star rating. The  <START:F_Drinks> beer <END>  was kept well and had the distinctive west flavour. Now onto why we come back here drunk and sober, the  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END> . The Missus went for a grilled haloumi  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with blue  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END> , jalapenos, and cajun spice.Yep  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  on  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  I am assured it was well good. Myself I went for double  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END>  with all sorts added on, check my photos.The toppings for  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  are done in 2 teirs of costing - free or 50p. Make sure you grab the cajun spice on whatever you  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> . ;DAll in good  <START:Service> service <END> , great  <START:F_FoodItem> burgers <END>  and you can get a pint with it. Thumbs up from me I will definately be back at the point I need some good fast  <START:Food> food <END> .

I know it would be wrongheaded to expect a great  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  from a  <START:A_Plc_Bar> bar <END>  and maybe I should not have ordered it.  The  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  was not good.  It was more of a vegetable wrap.  My date didn't take the  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  detour and ordered a wrap directly.  It was a lonely little thing in a plastic basket.  She described it as "good, not great."  But these facts alone do not earn this  <START:Restaurant> restaurants <END>  two stars.  Mortimer's gets this rating because they served  <START:Food> dinner <END> , on a Friday night, with plastic silverware.  No points awarded for how amazingly close an approximation to real, shiny silverware these plastic forks and  <START:S_Cutlery> knives <END>  provided.  The  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END> , the cramped quarters, and yes, the plastic silverware all gave me the impression that I was dining on an airplane.

living in norcal, cici's commercials used to always come on the  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>   <START:Restaurant> there <END> .  i remember thinking wowie, all you can eat  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  for 5 doll hairs, thats soooooo coooooool.  then i discovered that  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  were none near where i lived, so i got ready to walk across the freeway because  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  was no way i could live without cici's.fortunately, i another idea popped in my head and said hey, don't kill yourself, just go to a cici's next  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  you're out of town.  i said ok.  when i went to vegas, another friend had the same exact incident, so we decided to go.  boy, talk about mediocre.  what can you really expect for 4 doll hairs.the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was very friendly, and they kept the pizzas coming out.  a good variety to choose from, but it was just average at best.  nothing spectacular.  again, i wasn't expecting much for 4 bucks.  i'm not trashing it, but i wouldn't go out of my way for it either.

I hadn't been in here since it changed from Teakwoods to Tavern Grille. Layout hadn't changed much but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  did seem to be more  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tvs <END> . They still do the peanuts on the floor thing. They added a smoking  <START:A_Plc_Patio> patio <END>  off the front.  I ordered one of the  <START:Food> specials <END>  of the day, Sloppy Joe Mac. It was good although really rich.  <START:Service> service <END>  was good and friendly.

Unbelievable  <START:Service> service <END>  and the best italian I've had in Vegas!!The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was so friendly and catering. The  <START:Food> food <END>  was fantastic. I had the special white  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  and a  <START:F_FoodItem>   chicken     salad   <END> ... Pretty basic huh, but it truly stood out from any other  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  or  <START:F_FoodItem>   chicken     salad   <END>  a have ever hadAfter speaking with the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  I was informed that everything is freshly made in-house on premisses and nothing is frozen. You can really  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  the difference here. I can't  <START:W_Waiting> wait <END>  to come back and try the Philly  <START:F_FoodItem>   cheese   steak <END> .

I'm a big fan. They are super nice  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  an definitely make you feel welcome!  I got the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> fried   rice   <END>  and I will tell you, it was the best I've ever had hands down. So good and fresh. If I wasn't so full I would have gotten more. Their edamame was super big and fresh as well and I wasn't sure I could finish it. Of course I did. The whole office loved their  <START:Food> food <END>  and we will definitely be ordering  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  again

love  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> ! love the  <START:S_Staff> people <END> ! hope it stays  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  for a long long  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END> ...

Wow, this is a good  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> !  Everything  <START:F_FI_Taste> tasted <END>  so fresh, and the sandwiches were expertly assembled.  Though I think the  <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  (which is made  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  in the store) really makes the  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> , I am also a fan of the good  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> meats <END>  they use.  The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was helpful, friendly, and patient with me as an indecisive first timer.  Great  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  on Market Square.  Wish I had one of these back home!

Great, attentive  <START:Service> service <END> . Clean  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> . A little hole-in-the- <START:A_Decor> wall <END>  type  <START:Restaurant> place <END> . Got free  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> potato <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  and free lentil  <START:F_FoodItem> soup <END>  to start with, both of which were great, but we're boiling hot when they came out (better than being cold). I had the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and ground beef kabob combo, which comes with  <START:F_FoodItem> rice <END>  and  <START:F_FoodItem> pita   bread   <END> , as well as sliced tomatoes and onion on the side. My boyfriend has the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  kabob platter. Good  <START:Food> portions <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> . 20% off one entree or  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  when you check in on Yelp or foursquare.

 <START:Food> food <END>  is going down the tubes fast.  What a way to kill a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END> !!!   <START:F_FoodItem> bread <END>  CHARGE!!!!  REALLY??????????????

Not gonna lie,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  deserves the 4.5 stars that it has on Yelp.  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is excellent if you're tired of the same old junk in Vegas. Buldogis has excellent  <START:Service> service <END>  in terms of the kindness of the chefs and cashiers, they really know how to make you feel welcomed. The  <START:Food> food <END>  here is really unique, its not something you'd be able to find just anywhere. Words themselves cannot describe the  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  of Buldogis, so I recommend anyone to just come at least once to try it out. Whether you like Asian  <START:Food> food <END>  or American  <START:Food> food <END> , it's an excellent blend of both!

Great  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  kabob and shawarma! Great  <START:Food> lunch <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  if you're by downtown. They are always friendly.

The combination  <START:F_FoodItem> fried   rice   <END>  was amazing.....three  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  combo for $25...all in all a really great  <START:Food> meal <END>  for the  <START:W_Price> price <END> .   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  could be a little bigger, but the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> taste <END>  makes up for it. The  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  was clean and the  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  friendly, although the  <START:Service> service <END>  was a bit slow. Overall I really liked the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  and will definately be back.

You've GOT to try the ribs!!! That's what my parents kept telling me when we sat down.For a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  located at a Zoo,  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  has the market on KC BBQ in Arizona.Their  <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  is huge, the  <START:Food> portions <END>  are huge and the  <START:W_Price> prices <END>  are about average.I personally ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> taco   salad   <END>  (because of the shell) and my parents both ordered the full rack of ribs, cajun style. They don't eat a lot and both managed to finish their ribs in one sitting. I helped by eating two, but really that didn't do a whole lot.Both were served with your choice of two sides and a  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and both were FANTASTIC!I would HIGHLY recommend both the  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  & the Zoo. Best ever!

Okay, right off the bat I need to state that I am a Goin-Out-TO- <START:Food> breakfast <END>  fiend. It is my favorite  <START:Food> meal <END>  to eat out. It's simple. It's relaxing. It's friendly. It's a uncomplicated. A good  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  joint still offers value, a sense of community and belly full of warm yummy goodness.I learned to appreciate the beauty of a great  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  joint at a  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  called the Red Hill  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  Shop in Rancho Cucamonga Ca. Side note; It used to be just Cucamonga but then the powers that be got together and decided that tacking a Rancho on the front made it sound less looney tunish...... Nice try. So Red Hill  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END>  Shop is the  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  that all  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  joints are judged by in my little world. And one of the things, among many, that  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  it on that oh so lofty pedestal are the hashbrowns.Their hashbrowns are the shredded variety. Wonderfully crispy and brown on the  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  and tender and moist on the  <START:A_Places> inside <END> . Each bite giving you that beautiful contrast of textures and when you get a little bit of the  <START:F_FoodItem> egg <END>  or syrup in that bite an added dimension of  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavor <END> . Another thing that makes the hashbrowns at RHCS so noteworthy; they don't hold back on the  <START:Food> portion <END> .And that brings me to the point of this 2 star review. I live right around the corner from the S Buffalo  <START:A_LocatedArea> location <END>  of Baby Stacks. I've seen the yelp and other reviews that have praised  <START:Restaurant> this place <END>  . I've noticed that it's fairly busy. But in Vegas I always take user reviews with a grain of salt. And that grain of salt gets bigger the closer you get to Summerlin. After all, this is the town in which the readers of the RJ consistently name PF Chang's the best Chinese  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  (?). So I stopped by BS this morning and ordered a side of hashbrowns to go. I didn't have  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  to sit down and eat a full  <START:Food> breakfast <END> . I figured a side of hashbrowns would be a good bell-weather for me. And I have to say it was. You ever go to a Denny's, which I haven't done in 20 years, and when the  <START:Food> food <END>  comes you look at the hashbrowns and think, "Really?"?  Well in the case of the hashbrowns I got at BS this morning "Really?" would have been a stretch. It was a $3.18 smidgen of fried shredded  <START:F_FoodItem> potatoes <END> . My 16 y/o called them an "epic fail". I'm not usually an overly anal person. Obviously I love my hashbrowns but I felt I needed to quantify the ridiculousness of this  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of hashbrowns, so I weighed them. With the togo container they weighed in at an anemic 2 oz. $3 for 2 oz of hashbrowns? Really? That's $24 a pound. This review has gone on way too long already to get into the millions of prepared  <START:Food> foods <END>  that I can get for less than $24 a pound.BS, I'm sure all your  <START:Food> food <END>  is as wonderful as your many customers point out. I think it's great that you are a mom and pop business making a go of it. That in and of itself is praiseworthy. But come on,  <START:F_FoodItem> potatoes <END>  are cheap. The griddle is always running. It takes little effort to keep the hashbrowns flowing and plentiful. They are a low overhead item that makes  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  say to their friends, "Great  <START:Food> breakfast <END>  joint, and you should see the hashbrowns."Long after the trendy red velvet thing has passed,  <START:S_Staff> people <END>  will still love going out to  <START:Food> breakfast <END> .

A great cali-mex type of joint. Exactly like Roberto's but better  <START:Service> service <END> . Always a great tasting  <START:Food> meal <END>  with a smile. Reminds me of a local hole in the  <START:A_Decor> wall <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END>  after catching some tasty waves.

Ok, about a month ago I came across a picture of a new  <START:Food> food <END>  truck posted by Local Foodnik Joel LaTondress, known to the Phoenix  <START:Food> food <END>  community and the twitterverse as @AZHotdish.  Not often does a simple picture cause so much commotion, but since the snapshot in question was of a  <START:Food> food <END>  truck focused on Northeastern seaside cuisine namely  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  and other such briny delicacies, foodies began buzzing, posting queries clamoring for further details.  Further information about where to find this culinary treasure or whether it actually existed was thin and the discussion seemed to end.A quick check of the URL www.mainelobsterlady.com got me a contact number to call which led to a rather pleasant conversation and information as to scheduled appearances.  Today, after almost a month of waiting, I went into stealth mode to get into the Arabian Horse Show (who cares about the horses when  <START:Restaurant> there <END> 's  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  to eat?) and get myself a  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> .The Maine  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Lady operates out of a very tidy, well equipped trailer.  As you approach you can almost  <START:A_Environment> smell <END>  the salt  <START:A_Env_AC> air <END>  and then theres the  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> ... Two different styles of  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> ,  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  puffs and  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  chowder to name a few.  Barely able to control my glee, I ordered a tradiditonal  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  puffs.Served on a hot,  <START:F_FoodItem> butter <END>  grilled  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  sat easily a half pound of some of the best prepared, most succulent  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  i've ever eaten.  This  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  is the epitome of simplicity with the barest hint of lemon aioli, chunky  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  tail and claw  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  and a buttery sweet  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> . I cant even begin to describe how tasty this  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  was and the $18  <START:W_Price> price <END>  was well  <START:W_Price> worth <END>  it.To accompany my  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>  were an  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  of " <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END>  puffs" ($8.50), think of hushpuppies stuffed with succulent bay  <START:F_FoodItem> shrimp <END> , a crunchy exterior and soft, well seasoned, piping hot  <START:A_Decor> interior <END> .  Oh yeah, this was just melt in your mouth delicious when dipped in creamy tartar sauce.I dont know if you have any interest in horses but if you value your tastebuds and the happiness of your belly, get out to the horse show or find the Maine  <START:F_FoodItem> lobster <END>  Lady at one of her other events this  <START:F_FoodItem> spring <END>  and indulge, If you arent able to find her, stay tuned as I eat my way through her  <START:S_Menu> menu <END> .  You may live vicariously through my culinary adventures!

I am sad to report that this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  seems to me to be losing ground. It never seemed a great  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  but my first experiences involved competent  <START:W_Waiting> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  that  <START:O_Payment> paid <END>  attention to the customers and a kitchen capable of serving customers decent  <START:Food> food <END>  in a timely way. I posted a positive review at one point. I have been back three times since. Each  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  was a little worse.  <START:Service> service <END>  is slower. Kitchen takes more  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  getting  <START:Food> food <END>  out.  <START:W_Waiting> wait <END>   <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  loses touch with customers. In June I said never again but I was back in November.  <START:S_Staff> waiter <END>  started off well. First round of  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  showed up quickly. Getting his attention for the second round was harder. He has mastered the trick of serving someone nearby, perhaps walking within a couple of feet of you and not noticing a waving hand or raised glass. We got the  <START:Food> food <END>  we wanted but saw the wrong  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  delivered to one person, saw another couple not get their  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  and give up and saw a 40 minute delay (I think, I didn't have a stopwatch) for an entree  <START:F_FoodItem> salad <END> .  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is convenient.  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is very nice but  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  is more to a  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  than that....

 <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  is incredible!  The turkey  <START:F_FoodItem> pastrami <END>  Is one of the best sandwiches ever!!!  The Mac n  <START:F_FoodItem> cheese <END>  is delicious.  The  <START:Service> service <END>  is excellent too!   The whole  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  is over the top helpful.  We will be back!

We ordered the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  tempora,  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  Poki  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  and the big  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>   <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END>  were delishious especially the  <START:F_FoodItem> tuna <END>  Poki!!! I think that is the best  <START:F_FoodItem> roll <END>  I've ever had.The  <START:Service> service <END>  is outstanding and they have a  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tv <END>  screen showing the  <START:F_FoodItem> sushi <END>   <START:S_Staff> chef <END>  creating your  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> !When we left everyone was kind and thanked us for our patronage.

Perfect  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  for Sunday football! They have tons of  <START:A_Ent_Tv> tvs <END>  playing every  <START:A_Entertainment> game <END> . Heaven for fellow fantasy football participants. The  <START:S_Staff> staff <END>  was on point and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was really good. I def recommend the  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  and waffles from their  <START:Food> breakfast <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END> . The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  tenders were  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to perfection and the waffles were so fluffy!! All for like $9 or something. They have a pretty good Bloody Mary for $4 on their early bird  <START:F_Drinks> drink <END>   <START:S_Menu> menu <END>  as well. My friends and I had a great  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  here! If I lived in az, I'd def make  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  a  <START:F_FI_Size> regular <END>  spot for football sundays.

I think what I got was called the cheddar melt... it was a  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled   cheese     sandwich   <END>  with extra-interesting spiciness. Almost a little overwhelming on the seasoning for me, but I'm generally not used to any seasoning at all in my  <START:F_FoodItem> grilled   cheese   sandwiches <END> . Might need to tone down the seasoning just a tad.Picked tater tots as the side, and they were good. Not too salty.

Excellent  <START:Restaurant> place <END> , and a very unique eating  <START:O_Experience> experience <END> ! Everything we tried here - the starters, the sashimi, the  <START:F_FoodItem> rolls <END> , the  <START:F_Drinks> coffee <END> -seasoned  <START:F_FoodItem> pork <END>  belly were all extremely delicious and such a strange, yet sumptuous blend of  <START:F_Ingredients> ingredients <END>  and  <START:F_FI_Taste> flavors <END> . We left the  <START:Restaurant> place <END>  with fully sated  <START:F_Appetizer> appetites <END>  and a conviction to eat out here every  <START:S_Del_Time> time <END>  we come back to Vegas.

Great  <START:Service> service <END> , tasty  <START:Food> food <END> .  I'm glad we finally got a good Brazilian steak house in Pittsburgh!  I've been to the other two in PGH and the  <START:Food> food <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END>  do not come close to comparing.  I've been to Fogo De Chao (multiple cities), Chima, and a few other Brazilian Steakhouse as I travel the county for my job and this is right up  <START:Restaurant> there <END>  with them in  <START:Food> food <END>   <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  and  <START:Service> service <END> .  I'm not sure what the other reviewers are saying about the bad  <START:Service> service <END> , but the  <START:Service> service <END>  here was awesome.  They were fast and dealt extremely well with getting the  <START:F_FoodItem> meat <END>  we wanted as well as  <START:F_FI_CookingLevel> cooked <END>  to the right temperature for various likings at our  <START:A_Furniture> table <END> .  Simply put....I'll be back.  Can't say the same for the greenforest  <START:Restaurant> cafe <END>  or the palms.  btw...my wife is originally from Brazil and I've eaten at Churrascaria in Sao Paulo and Rio in addition to all the chains here in the USA, so I can confidently say this is definitely one of the better ones!

The Sichuan  <START:F_FoodItem> eggplant <END>  was not good: sweet, one-dimensional.  The sliced  <START:F_FoodItem> fish <END>  poached in oil, a great dish usually, was OK, but I did not detect any Sichuan peppercorns, and it was not spicy enough. Other dishes were between mediocre and good. <START:Service> service <END>  was friendly and attentive. <START:Restaurant> there <END>  are several other better Sichuan options in Montreal.

I was hoping  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  would be great! Ordered the bacon wrapped dates which I probably wouldn't  <START:S_Delivery> order <END>  again. The  <START:F_FoodItem> chicken <END>  chorizo paella was terrible. We took one bite & sent it back. Probably the worst I've ever had. Sent it back & never had a  <START:S_Staff> manager <END>  come to the  <START:A_Furniture> table <END> . Our  <START:S_Staff> server <END>  was nice & it was obvious that she had just come back from a smoke break. I don't have any intentions on going back.

This is our favorite  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END>   <START:Restaurant> place <END> ! We will always come here when we are craving a  <START:F_FoodItem> sandwich <END> . Daniel & Nick are especially great and super friendly! They really care about customers' needs and want to make sure we get what we want. We will be returning again and again!

 <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  goes fast  <START:Food> food <END> , as you have to stand in line to  <START:S_Delivery> order <END> .  And just when you find a spot to sit, they call your name.  Despite it being fast  <START:Food> food <END> , the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  is actually pretty good.  It's thin, crispy, and you pick your toppings.  The salads are great too.

Yuuuuuummmmmmmm.You know you have a damn good  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  when you compare it to one you had whilst in Rome, and your new prize wins.Lovely, friendly  <START:Service> service <END> , delicious  <START:F_Appetizer> appetizer <END> , and good wine. Not to mention it has a lovely  <START:Ambience> atmosphere <END> --we walk past  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  often and always paused by the windows with our noses pressed against the glasses, peering  <START:A_Places> inside <END>  wistfully like children, commenting, "Doesn't that look cozy?"And indeed it was. If you're looking for some good Italian eats, give  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END>  a shout.

AMAZING  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> !!!!! Love  <START:Restaurant> this   place   <END> !!!!!!I LOVE the 800 Degrees in LA, so I was super excited to find this  <START:Restaurant> restaurant <END>  on the strip!All the  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END>  options are awesome....I especially loved the verde one, cause I'm a sucker for green sauce. The toppings are yummy and fresh.....love the  <START:F_Ingredients> capers <END>  and kalamata  <START:F_Ingredients> olives <END> . If you like spicy  <START:F_FoodItem> pizza <END> , DEFINITELY get the chili sauce topping! It's to die for!  I even bought a bottle of the chili sauce on my 3rd visit here. EXTRA plus......it's walking distance from Aria.....so you can get great  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END>  and then head to 800 Degrees for a satisfying  <START:Food> dinner <END>  :)

Fabulous  <START:Food> lunch <END> ...vegan  <START:F_FoodItem> burger <END> , hummus, and raw veggies to dip.  Gorgeous & delicious.  Very reasonably  <START:W_Price> priced <END> .  <START:S_Staff> owners <END>  &  <START:S_Staff> servers <END>  were terrific.  I'll be back!   Thanks so much for the energetic  <START:Food> lunch <END>  ... served  <START:A_OutsideView> outside <END>  on this sunny day.

Came here on one of the pre-opening nights and the  <START:Food> food <END>  was fabulous with great  <START:Service> service <END> .  Fun vibe, high energy and a great addition to Tempe. Started with antipasti; then we had the rainbow trout and Korean style ribeye cap. Very limited availability so ask for it asap.   <START:F_Dessert> dessert <END>  was the bourbon black bottom  <START:F_FoodItem> pie <END> . Yum, yum! We enjoyed plenty of wine and scotch  <START:F_Drinks> drinks <END> .

We just ordered nachos and a  <START:F_FoodItem> burrito <END>  for delivery (via postmates) and were very disappointed by the  <START:F_FI_Quality> quality <END>  of the  <START:Food> food <END> . It was average at best and pretty forgettable. We won't likely return again.
