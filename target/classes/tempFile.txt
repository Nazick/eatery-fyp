another town location that understand foot traffic a a a mention that because there are some that never seem to have enough workers a a guess trying to save a penny a a there is always a lunch rush line and this visit no exception a however a a was able to get in and pay in less than 15 in a plus you food is ready as you go along nasty options a and large dining room space a a would go again aa piece of Charlotte history the BBQ is good a maybe not the best a kind compared the local due to able Flethcers in Gastonia.This is aright but not quite able style the days of the driven or waning.Go here for the experience before it is gone ahigh rush makes me happy a did you know a a it TOTALLY does a he and the queen made plans to have dinner somewhere a you know ... like normal civilised people a all we knew was that a wanted such and that we wanted something awesome a after looking around on yelp a chose to take the queen to CBNC... a to where is this place a a ummm... between 7th street lamp 10th street off of came a Okaaay a the left or right side of the road a a a upon a a that do you MEAN you do not know a have not you been here before a a Ummm... no a a oh HELL to the no the can then becomes filled with laughter passed right by it and then slipped a pitch out of no where and it made us fear for our lives a and then screams filled the can a soon we were marked front of a soon to be coming is pizza and headed to the case of my ll yelp dreams ... only to be met with a 20 minute wait a he were then outside and a was left to fight off the queen who seriously considered going to poky express instead a and then FINALLY our names were called and we were seated your witness was very nice a a want to say that it is the little touches that make CBNC great a the fresh thick lemon edge and fresh sprig of mind in the water pitches a the way the servers are so friendly a the even complimented on my Japanese pronunciation a a a a did not want to tell her the origin of my great accent ... watching will will a thousand times a the helped us order such a a wanted nigiri and they did not have it a a was disappointed but still went with her suggested crisply roll and alaskan roll a they were AMAZING a a loved the church and the floor a with the so such was scrumptious a he wanted to angel our orders and just get more such a the alaskan was great as well a a loved it a even the queen who never had such before liked it a after devouring the such our food came a a ordered the beef sofa google soul with temper a it came with chicken instead a a too a but the temper was perfect a may a a and a never had sofa foodies a a usually get upon or chinese foodies a but a really liked the floor and the fresh spniach that was willing more and more as time went on a the slight floor of the placed green opinions really made the dish something special a a loved it a a am just so sad that a could not finish it all a a one queen devoured the beef yakisoba foodies at once a a was able to speak my chopsticks between his sites and a got a taste a it was CRAZY yummy a each of the veggies had a great difinitive floor and yet headed together amazing a a loved it a the other queen was pleasant surprised at the taste of his spicy beef vice plate a he could not finish his either but it was really a a ll too spicy for my taste a but it was still awesome a he then ordered a bottle of wine and a sir here and a sir there and we were all in heaven a walking to our witness about the Navajo such chef behind the such bar who she was trying to hook up with one of us ... but we could not tell WHO she was trying to hook him up with a one of the queen or me a a said chef never made it to our table a and it is just as well ... we were in food heaven saving our delight and wishing we had bigger stomachs to take it all in a a am a big an of this place now and am VOWING to take several people with me next time a a ahe live by MOTO so we are kind stuck when it comes to such establishments a the such blows a you can tell it is not fresh fish and never taste supper a the too a beer are the only good things a a do not really trust a such place that hide the such makers in the kitchen...stuff probably looks like week old ship which it is aa originally walked in here and thought to myself man a bet this place is a hot place of old people in the morning to a can see the shall wearing old ladies gathered here in the morning drinking their coffee and gazing like little chatting path does about the new pool boy a and the old does talking about their hours in am and the more and the few survivor from the big one to to a to say the least a did not see that but a did picture it in my mind ...suffice to say it was not like that but that was my first visitor a that is good about this place is it has plenty of space the staff seems very attentive and it is clean and the sandwiched are delirious with pretty large portion a not huge or anything but recent a a did think it was a little price considering a could get a bigger better sandwich at sunday for about a 30 helper a his place in not bad a gun of the will a little price a but would not be opposed to going here again aa friend of a friend was telling us about this place on sunday morning a and how awesome their pizza is a it sounded awesome a but he warned us the line is usually an hour and a half long a oh well a we went anyway a Luckily a we were early enough where we did not have to wait long for a table a then we were leaving a though a the line was easily an hour long a he started with the sings a which come in an order of 14 and were delirious a give of us were dining there a so we ordered two small pizza a with each one being a half a so we had a nice variety of pizza to try from a he got the BBQ chicken a the Frisco a Grandma a is a and one more that clues me now a all were pretty delirious a and a give them mad drops for going out of their way to create unique pizza with traditional tapping a Grandma a is had potato on it a a our entice bill with a few drink came to under a 80.Oh a make sure you sit outside ... the inside had a lot of loud lids a and it seemed to echo off each wall and any the well out of our party a the women in our party also said the air temperature kept changing in there a keep in mind a too a that they do not have a full bar a so if you are going there hoping to start off with a bloody mary a you are out of luck ahis is about as close to an authentic Japanese izakaya as you all find anywhere a and a am talking countrywide a a ve been to several izakaya in Japan over the years and this place just brings me back there immediately a my japanese ruddy in an francisco is jealous of this place to give you a little perspective on my claim a the food is incredible and you all find yourself hard pressed to try everything they have to offer as new items come and go all the time a a recommend dan near everything on the menu a of something scores you a ORDER to a and you all be presently surprised everytime a of you do try this place a make sure you get a members card a as you will delicately be returning a for every 5 you spend you get a stamp a the initials card save you 5 a a fill it up and you save 10 a a fill up a second card and you save 15 a a his is permanent by the way a you can use it for every visit a to to THERE ALREADY a and a all most likely see you there as a am there 45 times a week aoh sweet baby less a a love this place a pedro decor a a waiter who does a albert DeNiro impression a and amazing speaks a about did way through my a rare a retire file the other night turned to my husband and said a a a want to give this speak a baby a because that is how good it is a there is always a point where a start to get sad that my speak will be gone shortly a so a try to slow down a but it is too hard at the golden other a a do not want to slow down a Nomnomnom.Forget the stupid fancy places in the hotels on the strip a the golden other is the real deal.Go a now aa am no Korean/Hawaiian food expert a but this place has lived up to the hope a thanks made for the recommendations a myself and a few workers came here today a and not a single one of us was not impressed first off a the kimchi is bob here a a can usually leave out the kimchi a but that is only because so many places in began have mediocre kimchi a not this kimchi a you all get this as an appetizer a so even if you are not a kimchi person you have to try it a our servers a the owner a a sense my worker is enthusiasm over the kimchi a being the kimchi fantastic that he is a and complimented us some dumplings a off the hook a the trust was kind of thick a but not greasy at all a the met was delirious a great spite and her floor a a good sign of things to come ... a ordered the not lock i him cap a origin taste a quality beef a supper fresh veggies a and really nice Kochujang a a such a the Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet a and subtle savored a that set this dish apart for me was the high quality for just around a 1000 a oh a and do not forget the crystallised vice brains at the bottom a despite morning myself on fills of kimchi a a could not stop eating the i him cap until every last vice grain was gone a must a great version of this elastic morgan dish a also managed to taste my friend is bulgolgi a a normal do not like bulgolgi because it is always tough and overlay faced a not this bulgolgi a which is the best a have ever had a VERY tender a and expert reasoned a the such was light and of a homemade quality a must deliciousAgain a special thanks to made and the other helper a a do not know why it has taken me so long to try island style a of you do not know if you like morgan food a this is the place to try it a of you do not always feel like morgan food a this is the place to go when you do a of you are a morgan food sob a give island style a try and let me know what you think ato sad a his used to be one of my have places a over the last 10 years a ve rarely ever make my trip there anymore because a am readily disappointed in the quality if food a seat is spotted or search a spring roll filling probably a week old a a to sad because they literally have the best had that and carry square on a good day a today a was braving bean thread google so a thought a would given them a chance against a once again slipped on met a vice is old and yellow a how can you not make fresh vice everyday a a a and they seem to think spicy means throwing in a ship road of crushed red pepper which adds no floor or spite just stomache irritation a a a am so sad to say a after over 10 years this my last straw a had because there is so much potential if they took the time to delivery the quality aeasily the best restaurant in Madison a
